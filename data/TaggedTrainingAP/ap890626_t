 <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> bet on <ORGANIZATION> Cincinnati </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reds </ORGANIZATION> games over a three-year span beginning in 1985, and once accumulated a $ 400,000 gambling debt over a three-month period, the sport's investigator concludes in a 225-page report released Monday. The report by baseball investigator <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dowd </PERSON> was publicly released Monday by a state judge who had kept it private until after he ruled on <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>'s request for a temporary restraining order. `` Between May and July 1987, Rose bet ... $ 2,000 per game on baseball, including <ORGANIZATION> Reds </ORGANIZATION> games,'' the report said. <LOCATION> Hamilton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Common Pleas Judge <PERSON> Norbert </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nadel </PERSON> released the report Monday under pressure from the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, which said he had no reason to keep it sealed. <PERSON> Nadel </PERSON> on Sunday granted <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>'s request to block a hearing that was scheduled for Monday in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with baseball Commissioner <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON> <PERSON> Giamatti </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>'s manager, could be banned from the game for life if it is determined that he bet on the <ORGANIZATION> Reds </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Dowd </PERSON>'s report said there was much evidence that he did, although it noted that <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> has denied under oath he ever bet on major league baseball. `` The accumulated testimony of witnesses, together with documentary evidence and telephone records, reveal extensive betting activity by <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> with professional baseball and, in particular, <ORGANIZATION> Cincinnati </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reds </ORGANIZATION> games, during the 1985, 1986 and 1987 seasons,'' <PERSON> Dowd </PERSON> said in the report. The report quotes <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> associate <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Janszen </PERSON> as saying `` within a three-month period of time, <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> was in debt over $ 400,000 to the bookie in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.'' It does not indicate if the debt was due to baseball debts or wagers on other sports. Rose bet 52 times on the <ORGANIZATION> Reds </ORGANIZATION> _ and won 29 _ from April 8-July 5, 1987, according to gambling records cited in <PERSON> Dowd </PERSON>'s report. <PERSON> Dowd </PERSON> cited telephone records and betting slips supplied by <PERSON> Janszen </PERSON>, who claims to have run bets for <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>, as supporting evidence. He also said that evidence supports the testimony of bookmaker <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Peters </PERSON>, who claims he took perhaps more than $ 1 million in bets on behalf of Rose over a two-year period. `` The evidence revealed that in order to protect his stature as one of the most famous baseball players in major league history, <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> employed middlemen to place bets for him with bookmakers and at the raetrack and to pay gambling losses and collect gambling winnings, thereby concealing his gambling activity,'' <PERSON> Dowd </PERSON> wrote. Despite the $ 400,000 debt, the report said, <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> had been successful early in the 1987 season in bets with <PERSON> Peters </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>'s chief accuser <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, an associate of <PERSON> Peters </PERSON>, recalled being told by <PERSON> Peters </PERSON> during the 1987 season that he was `` getting murdered'' by <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> on baseball. `` <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> stated that <PERSON> Peters </PERSON> advised him that <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> had him ` hooked' for ` about seventy-five thousand,' `` the report said. In addition, the report says that <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> owned half of a $ 47,646 Pik-Six ticket at <LOCATION> Turfway </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> on April 6, 1989. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gioiosa </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>'s former housemate, `` falsely represented to the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> that he was the sole winner,'' the report said. <PERSON> Gioiosa </PERSON> has been indicted for that and <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> is under investigation by a federal grand jury in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>. After the <ORGANIZATION> Reds </ORGANIZATION> beat <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> 5-3 Monday night, <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> was asked if he believed the report was balanced. `` I can give you an outline,'' he said. `` There's 225 pages and there's two paragraphs positive about me. It's such a biased report it's unbelievable. But we will face that because there's not a thing we can do about it.'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stachler </PERSON>, a Rose attorney, said he was not bothered that the report was made public. He declined further comment.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> supports legislation to restore criminal penalties for flag-desecration, but has n't decided whether to back a constitutional amendment, his spokesman said Monday. `` We have n't undertaken a kind of legal analysis that would yield some definitive action,'' said press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. However, he said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s views were clear. `` He was very upset'' about last week's 5-4 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling overturning flag-desecration laws in 48 states, `` and I'm sure -LRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> -RRB- shares the views of members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and others who have all expressed their feeling that the flag should not be desecrated in any way,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. In an interview published in Tuesday editions of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I think I've sublimated some of the passion I feel, and I'm very open-minded as to what to do about it. And I've asked our attorney general -LRB- <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> -RRB- and chief of staff -LRB- <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> -RRB- to recommend what to do about it. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told his interviewers the depth of his feeling possibly `` goes back to one's own personal experience in life, too, being in the service and all, in combat.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plane was shot down and two crew members killed in 1945. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was rescued from the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> bu a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> submarine. `` Flag burning is wrong, dead wrong,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said after the ruling, but said he would enforce the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> edict as president. There have been moves in both the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to meet the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s objections and make flag-desecration a federal offense, but lawmakers are divided on how best to accomplish that. Some favor an amendment to the Constitution. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is looking at possible legislation. But at this point we do n't have an official view in terms of legislation,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` But I think the president's attitude is certainly clear. And if legislation was developed and passed, I'm sure it would be one that he would support.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said a `` preponderance of scholars seem to be suggesting that -LRB- a constitutional amendment -RRB- is not a very good way to go.''

<TEXT>
 Hotel queen <PERSON> Leona </PERSON> <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> went on trial Monday on federal charges that she evaded income taxes by disguising about $ 4 million in renovations to her mansion as business expenses. Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>, 68, watched as potential jurors were questioned about their impartiality and how much they knew about the highly publicized case. By late afternoon, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> had interviewed 18 potential jurors and dismissed four. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said he would screen the pool of 160 prospective jurors this week and allow attorneys to make their final peremptory challenges July 5 before opening arguments. One man was excused because he said he was upset about being asked his salary and because he was mad at judges in general for allowing the flag to be burned, referring to last week's <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision. The other potential jurors who were dismissed were a man who had read an article about Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> in Monday's <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>; an accountant who once did work for a company that will be named at trial; and a man who said he was angry with the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> for the way it handled a tax problem. Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> was named in a 47-count indictment in April 1988 with her husband, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON>, and two former <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> executives. The Helmsleys, who head a $ 5 billion hotel and real estate empire, were accused of evading personal income taxes by concealing about $ 4 million in renovations to their <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, mansion as business expenses. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>, 80, has been found incompetent to stand trial because of his memory lapses. The other defendants, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Turco </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Licari </PERSON>, are charged with helping create bogus invoices to make it appear the renovations on the 28-room mansion were tax-deductible improvements on business properties. Many potential jurors said they knew the <ORGANIZATION> Helmsleys </ORGANIZATION> from media reports and Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> from advertisements for her hotels that portray her as the `` queen'' of Helmsley-owned hotels. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> allowed jurors to remain in the pool if they said they could be impartial. One answer given by a 28-year-old architect's intern prompted a cold stare from Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>. The juror was asked what he knew of the Helmsleys from the media. `` He's old and feeble, and <PERSON> Leona </PERSON> runs things,'' the man said.

<HEAD>Germany Moving Against Firm in Iran Chemical Weapons Deal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The West German government is taking action against a German firm that has arranged the sale to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> of chemicals that make poison gas, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials confirmed Monday night. The officials said Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> discussed the sale with Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> during <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON>'s visit to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last week. `` We've been very happy'' with the German response, said one official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Both officials said they did not have precise details of just what the <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> government was doing in the case. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said in Tuesday editions that a <LOCATION> Dusseldorf </LOCATION> firm, which <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials did not identify, had acted as a broker in arranging the sale to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> of hundreds of tons of thionyl chloride, a chemical that can be used to make mustard gas, by an Indian manufacturer. The bulk of the chemicals was said not to have been delivered. Iranian troops were the targets of several gas attacks by <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> in the eight-year war between those two countries. Last winter, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials accused German firms of helping <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> built a plant that could be used to produce chemical weapons, though <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> insisted the plant would be used for pharmaceuticals. In response, the <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> government has proposed legislation to stiffen export controls and penalties for violating them.

 A federal judge Monday extended a sealing order on several documents seized by government agents who were looking for evidence that <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> bought information to help it win defense contracts. Judge <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> extended until July 27 the sealing order affecting documents taken from the offices of <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> employees <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Elfering </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Geiger </PERSON>. The three were among those searched on June 14, 1988, in a nationwide sweep by federal agents investigating possible bribery of public officials, conspiracy and fraud in the defense department's procurement system A number of documents relating to searches of the <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> facilities of <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> have been sealed at the government's request since June 16, 1988. Other documents have been made public since the initial sealing order was filed. On May 17, the court had extended the sealing order for several of the documents until June 26, when the government had believed that its need for continued sealing of the documents would end. However, because of scheduling conflicts, the government moved to extend the order until July 27 because it had been unable to proceed as quickly as expected.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Maier </PERSON> believes he lost his arm in the service of his country. His country, until now, has disagreed. The arm _ a casualty of cancer, not combat _ was amputated at the shoulder seven years after <PERSON> Maier </PERSON>'s discharge from the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. But the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veteran, now 46 and living in <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, puts the blame for his cancer on Agent Orange, the toxic herbicide <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops sprayed over the jungles of southeast <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. He is convinced it was awash in the coffee-colored <LOCATION> Mekong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> water pumped aboard his ship for showers. Like more than 34,000 other <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans who believe they have become ill because of Agent Orange, <PERSON> Maier </PERSON> applied for government disability benefits. And like all but five of those applicants, he was denied. Now <PERSON> Maier </PERSON> hopes his claim will be reconsidered, thanks to a federal judge's ruling in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> last month that found the government failed to give Agent Orange claimants the benefit of the doubt. To the surprise of many veterans, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration decided not to appeal. Instead, Veterans Secretary <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> announced that the Department of Veterans Affairs, the new name for the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, would rewrite its rules for granting disability. <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON>'s decision could open the door to claims from hundreds of thousands of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans. Although 34,000 have applied for disability on the basis of Agent Orange exposure, about 250,000 veterans are listed in a registry of those who believe they were exposed to the herbicide. Many never applied because they believed they did n't stand a chance of getting disability. Officials for some veterans' organizations say they're cautiously optimistic that the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> has changed its attitude along with its name. `` It is our feeling at this point that Secretary <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> really does want to see some change,'' said <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasinitz </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Vietnam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, the group that brought the lawsuit in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. Others remain skeptical, their attitude reflecting the deep bitterness that many <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans feel toward a government that they believe used and abandoned them. `` We'll believe it when we see it,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Sparrow </PERSON>, the executive director of <ORGANIZATION> Vietnam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Victims </ORGANIZATION>, an advocacy group based in <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION> `` It's my feeling that they'll probably do as little as they can,'' said <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Hosty </PERSON>, an attorney for Swords to Plowshares, a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> group that provides counseling and representation for veterans seeking benefits. Still, Ms. <PERSON> Hosty </PERSON> added, `` I would love to be surprised. I would love to be wrong.'' Agent Orange, named for the orange-striped drums in which it was stored, was developed for the military in the early 1940s. It was a 50-50 mixture of two powerful herbicides _ 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T. In <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops sprayed Agent Orange from the air to strip away the enemy's jungle cover and deplete its crops. It worked devastatingly well. The herbicide was banned after the chemical dioxin, which is present in 2,4,5-T, was found to be the most carcinogenic substance ever tested on laboratory animals. Veterans organizations have pointed to evidence that the herbicide may cause serious disorders, including non-Hodgkins lymphoma, soft-tissue sarcoma and a liver ailment known as PCT. The VA, on the other hand, has maintained that Agent Orange has been scientifically linked to only one illness in humans, a severe skin rash called chloracne. And the government has insisted that veterans seeking benefits because of chloracne provide proof that they got the rash from Agent Orange, a burden that has been impossible for most to meet. However, in what some veterans see as a partial admission of responsibility, the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> has provided free medical care to anyone who believes he or she became ill because of Agent Orange. Under <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON>'s new orders, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> has begun redrafting its guidelines for disability benefits, starting by changing the way in which it determines whether a `` significant statistical association'' exists between Agent Orange and a disease. A scientific advisory committee planned to review the proposed changes at a meeting today with changes to be published in the Federal Register. <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> will make a final decision on the changes, probably in October. Once new guidelines are in place, the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION>'s advisory committee will reconsider whether links exist between Agent Orange and diseases that veterans believe it has caused. Again, a final decision will be up to <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON>. The stakes are high, as the makers of Agent Orange can attest. After veterans filed a lawsuit against them, seven chemical companies settled out of court for $ 180 million in 1984. <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> has said cost is irrelevant to the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION>'s stance. Disability benefits, which are independent of medical benefits or Social Security, currently range from $ 73 a month for a veteran who is 10 percent disabled to $ 1,468 a month for a veteran who is 100 percent disabled. If just 30,000 veterans were found to be 10 percent disabled, the cost to the government would be more than $ 26 million a year. For that reason alone, some veterans' advocates say they doubt the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> will adopt sweeping changes. `` The VA would literally be opening the doors to tens of thousands of claims,'' said <PERSON> Sparrow </PERSON>. `` I just do n't see how they could do it.'' <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Juarbe </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> program for the Veterans of Foreign Wars, commended <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> for taking `` a step in the right direction.'' Still, <PERSON> Juarbe </PERSON> said, `` I think the bottom line is, we're still going to require legislation. ... Given the way the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> has ruled in the past, we're not confident that we can rely on the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> to carry out this policy.'' One such piece of legislation was introduced in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> earlier this month. A bill by <PERSON> Sens </PERSON>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON>, D-Mass., <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif., and <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Daschle </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.D. </LOCATION>, would provide disability benefits for veterans who have non-Hodgkins lymphoma or soft-tissue sarcoma, two of the diseases associated with Agent `` It is time to end the bickering over which study shows the most connection between Agent Orange and certain illnesses and time to begin helping <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans,'' said <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> lieutenant who skippered a patrol boat in the <ORGANIZATION> Mekong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Claxton </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> sergeant who was, along with <PERSON> Maier </PERSON>, one of the original plaintiffs in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> lawsuit against the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION>, said he is optimistic about prospects for change. `` I just want the satisfaction of seeing that people are treated with justice and compassion,'' said <PERSON> Claxton </PERSON>, 46, of <LOCATION> Lansing </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, who believes his exposure to Agent Orange caused bleeding colitis and a nervous disorder. However, he added: `` Personally, I do n't ever expect to be paid back for what Agent Orange did to me. You pay a heavy price for war.''

<TEXT>
 One man's life work is hypnotizing frogs into pumping iron, and one woman used to get her paycheck from Bozo the Clown. `` Are we a little kooky?'' asks frog mesmerist <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Steed </PERSON>. `` Look at it this way. We work when we want to work, we make a fairly decent living, we make people happy and we're happy ourselves.'' Psychologist <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Weeks </PERSON> agrees. In an upcoming book, he says such people are among eccentric Americans who share many positive qualities. `` Many of their personality traits add up to a very good recipe for human happiness,'' said Weeks, of the <LOCATION> Royal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Edinburgh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. True eccentrics, he said, have a sense of humor, intense curiosity, a high sense of integrity and a desire to make the world better or at least happier. Weeks has been studying offbeat people for the past five years, and in an earlier book, `` Eccentrics: The Scientific Investigation,'' focused on Europeans. His new book is about Americans, and about half his estimated 1,000 subjects are from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Weeks does n't believe Californians are by nature flaky. But <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> seems to take pride in its oddballs, he said in an interview published in Sunday's <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jose </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's very tolerant and proud and nurturing of eccentricity,'' he said. `` In some parts of the world, by contrast, eccentricity is denigrated. In <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION>, for example, they call them ratbags. Not in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>.'' Among Weeks' subjects was <PERSON> Steed </PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION> Emeryville </LOCATION> across the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and has toured the fair circuit with 40 frogs and many laughs. His hypnotized frogs lie on their backs and lift tiny barbells with their front legs. <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoneberg </PERSON> is another Californian who became one of Weeks' subjects A former writer for <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s `` Bozo the Clown'' television show, <PERSON> Stoneberg </PERSON> said being eccentric is `` quite complimentary.'' `` I'd rather go down as an eccentric than as a routine, normal person,'' she says. <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Miner </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> is an artist who sells religious television programming from her home. She says her eccentricity `` is meant to make everyone laugh and get a giggle.'' One time, she said, she tried to get a giggle out of the postmaster general of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by poking her finger in his stomach and saying, `` Ding, ding, ding.'' Weeks, 45, whose Scottish accent belies his <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> birth, says eccentrics are curious because they're committed to whatever they're doing. But theirs is not a neurotic preoccupation because `` they're not really concerned about what other people think about them,'' he said.

 Nearly six years after an army firing squad killed Prime Minister <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> after a military coup, 17 people accused in the slaying still await a final verdict. <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON>'s death in a factional struggle within his ruling party helped lead to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> invasion of the island in 1983. The prisoners claim they were convicted in a U.S.-backed show trial to justify the invasion and eliminate the remaining inner circle of Bishop's Marxist regime. Of the 16 men and one woman, 14 are condemned to hang for murder. Three soldiers charged with the actual shooting face decades in prison for manslaughter. However, the prisoners are asking the Court of Appeal, <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION>'s highest court, to throw out their December 1986 convictions for the killing of <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> and several supporters Their appeal has been dragging on since May 1988, straining the tiny island's treasury and the patience of many of the nation's 90,000 residents, who have little sympathy for the prisoners `` The people are fed up with it,'' said <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON>, editor of the <ORGANIZATION> Grenadian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION>, an independent weekly newspaper. `` It's been going on and on and on. ... They want it finished with.'' The original High Court trial lasted nearly eight months, and it took a year to produce a 9,000-page court record. The 13 defense lawyers won a six-month delay to prepare the appeal. Seven months into the appeal, the president of the three-judge court died, and the appeal had to start again with a new president. At the current pace, it will go on through fall because the six-lawyer prosecution team has n't even started its case. Meanwhile, the Grenadian government is paying court costs as well as the fees and expenses of the 10 Jamaican lawyers representing those prisoners who claimed indigency. So far, the case has cost the government $ 2.7 million, or 5 percent of the nation's annual $ 55 million budget. `` It's bleeding us, but we're prepared to spend that sort of money ... so that we can say, ` Look at the sacrifice we're prepared to make,''' to give the defendants a fair trial, said Justice Minister <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>. The killing of <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON>, a popular prime minister, resulted from a dispute over leadership of his radical People's Revolutionary Government. A hard-line <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, led by <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Coard </PERSON>, took control and placed the prime minister under house arrest. On Oct. 19, 1983, hundreds of Bishop supporters converged on his residence and set him free. However, troop reinforcements rushed in, allegedly on orders of the military council. <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON>, three members of his Cabinet _ including his pregnant mistress, Education Minister <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> Cleft </PERSON> _ and four other people were lined up against a wall and shot by three soldiers. A witness said one assailant slit <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON>'s throat long after he was clearly dead and also cut off a finger to steal a ring. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> ordered the invasion involving 1,900 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops and small forces from other <LOCATION> Carribean </LOCATION> island nations. He said he wanted to protect the lives of about 1,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens in <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> and help restore democracy. Those on death row include <PERSON> Coard </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION>'s former deputy prime minister; his wife, <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON>; the former armed forces commander, Gen. <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON>; and the former ambassador to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Cornwall </PERSON>. The prisoners have accused authorities of human rights abuses ranging from withholding of sheets, blankets and underwear to beatings, bread-and-water diets and long periods of solitary confinement. Mrs. <PERSON> Coard </PERSON>, a former member of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> who wrote a book in prison called `` <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> War on One Woman,'' claims she has been held in solitary confinement for the past 4 -LCB- years and allowed to see her husband only in court.

 Three months have passed, and the sea still coughs up dead birds with every change of the tide. Three months have passed, and an army of workers 9,000 strong has yet to completely clean even one heavily oiled beach. Three months have passed, and the biggest oil spill in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history gets bigger every day, spreading its slime farther across <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s wild southern coast, pushing its poison deeper and higher along the food chain. `` We keep hoping for some kind of closure, some sign that this is all the damage we have and we can deal with it,'' says <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Castellina </PERSON>, superintendent of Kenai Fjords National Park. `` But we ca n't. The oil disappears one day when the waves clean a beach, only to wash up on another beach the next day.'' Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>'s bountiful waters and mountainous islands were the first to be fouled after the tanker Exxon Valdez rammed a reef March 24 and spilled almost 11 million gallons of North Slope crude oil. But the damage did n't stop there. Streamers of oil and tar balls leaked out between the sound's barrier islands and were pushed by Gulf of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> currents to beaches 450 miles away. Oil now has tainted more than 700 miles of shoreline, from the glacier-carved cliffs of Kenai Fjords to the clamoring bird rookeries of Katmai National Park, from lonely <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Inlet </LOCATION> beaches to the mouths of <LOCATION> Kodiak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> salmon streams. Cleanup workers have found the oil-soaked bodies of about 26,000 sea birds, 784 sea otters and 57 bald eagles. The spreading oil has other victims. Fishermen and other coastal residents who make their living from the ocean cringe each week at news of more beaches polluted and more fishing grounds closed. The wreck of the Exxon Valdez created an environmental catastrophe that unfolds in one little tragedy after another: _ A wildlife official filming damage on a beach sets a video cassette down on a black rock, and the rock crawls away It turns out to be an oil-smeared duck. _ A burly fisherman breaks into tears as he describes steering his boat through the slick: no water lapping, no birds crying, just the sickening silence of oil slipping past the hull _ At a bird rescue center in <LOCATION> Seward </LOCATION>, some of the patients are failing They have been washed clean, but not before swallowing fatal doses of oil. They do n't cry out; instinct tells them not to advertise their distress to predators. `` They just get real quiet, sit in a corner and die,'' says rescue coordinator <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Holcomb </PERSON>. Like a candy bar in the hands of a 2-year-old, crude oil from the <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valdez </ORGANIZATION> has gotten onto everything. Rainbow sheens on the water stream from suffocating mats of black goop on beaches. Wind and waves whip oil into a sticky froth that workers call `` chocolate mousse.'' Tar balls bob in the surf, washing ashore to melt in the sun and sink into the sand. Oil splatters driftwood logs high above the tide line and sinks as much as 3 feet into gravel beaches. Undulating blobs of oil hang below the water's surface, ready to foul fishermen's nets. At first, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> boldly promised to clean it all up. `` We're going to pick up _ one way or the other _ all the oil that's out there,'' <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Cornett </PERSON> told reporters one week after the Exxon Valdez ran aground. The promise did n't keep for long. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> was too slow and the spill was too big for booms to contain the oil immediately after the accident. And the company missed its chance during the first few days to burn off large quantities of oil or disperse it with chemicals. Some oil was skimmed up, but for the most part <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> had to wait for oil to wash up on shore, where the goo could be scraped, wiped or flushed painstakingly from rocks and gravel. By May 1, the clean-it-all promise had been modified. Exxon proposed to clean 364 miles of coastline by mid-September, noting that it might have to leave 191 additional miles of lightly oiled shore to be washed by nature. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> approved <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s plan, but even the limited cleanup may prove beyond the company's capability, despite an investment of more than $ 200 million to date. The cleanup effort now includes more than 9,000 workers, 800 boats, 45 oil skimmers, and 60 airplanes and helicopters. Hundreds of workers clad in rain slickers and hard hats crowd into coves that in most years might see a few fishermen or recreational boaters, if anyone at all. Barges nose up to shore, carrying generators and boilers to heat the water sprayed from hoses on the beach. Skimmers just offshore pick up oil as it flushes off the beach, while yet more vessels tend containment booms to keep the washed-off oil from spreading. Where there is n't enough machinery, workers hit the beaches with shovels, absorbent pads and plastic bags, scooping and scraping and wiping by hand. `` It has become pretty labor-intensive,'' says <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Amos </PERSON> <PERSON> Plante </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, which is overseeing <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s cleanup effort, has `` signed off'' on about 50 miles of shoreline along Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>. But that does n't mean a beach is clean _ it just means <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> can move on. Even the most intensive scrubbing can not touch oil imbedded deep within a beach. The word `` clean'' is now taboo on official forms used to track <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s efforts. Workers do n't clean beaches anymore. They `` treat'' them. The difference is more than semantics, as a visit to a Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> beach with a state environmental official shows. `` This,'' says <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Provant </PERSON> as he kicks an oily rock, `` is a treated beach.'' Provant, the on-scene cleanup coordinator for the <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION>, is standing on a <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> beach known to officials as GR-1A. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> signed off on this beach May 29, declaring that <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> crews had `` completed removal of gross contamination.'' Provant saw it back then, and it looked pretty good, he says. But now the oil is back. Globs of mousse litter the cobbled beach. Rainwater beads up on the rocks as it would on the waxed hood of a car. Provant digs into the sand, and his hand comes up greasy brown. `` If you dig, you find oil down quite a ways,'' Provant says. `` You can see how much oil has been washed back in or has percolated up from below. We're really not through with this beach.'' Provant's agency hounds <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>, suggesting ways the cleanup could run more efficiently. Exxon, state and federal officials spend hours each day arguing over how deeply to clean particular beaches, or whether cleaning them will do more harm than good. `` Everybody wants a clean beach, us included,'' says <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Plante </PERSON> `` The definition of clean is subject to interpretation. What we're obviously going to do is work as hard to do the best job we can. We may have some disagreements over whether it's sufficiently clean.''

 While the arguments rage onshore, the death toll mounts at sea. Stymied by vast distances and stormy weather, bird rescuers have been able to capture, clean and release only about 500 sea birds. For every surviving bird, more than 50 dead ones lie in freezer vans _ more than 26,000 in all. And that's just a fraction of total mortality. Some biologists say that for every dead bird collected, perhaps 100 have died unnoticed. Sea otters appear to be the hardest-hit marine mammal. The 784 dead sea otters collected so far represent about one-tenth of Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>'s total population. Harbor seals may be suffering, too, but few carcasses have been found. `` Dead seals sink like lead balloons,'' explains state marine biologist <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Frost </PERSON>. The oil's lethal reach extends down the food chain. On some beaches, mats of oil have wiped out all life, suffocating intertidal creatures such as limpets, mussels, crabs and starfish. And the oil reaches upward, to the tops of tall shoreside spruce trees where bald eagles roost. Oiled sea birds have become a fatal attraction for scavenging eagles, killing 57 of the birds of prey. Biologists have collected lifeless eggs from 30 abandoned eagle nests in the spill area. Hungry brown bears on the shores of Katmai National Park have feasted on oily bird carcasses until they could eat no more, digging holes in the sand to cache the leftovers. Bears are hardy creatures, but biologists have radio-collared 30 of them to study their reaction to swallowing so much oil. `` We have n't determined what effect it has on them. But I can imagine what it would do to me,'' says Katmai National Park Superintendent <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Bane </PERSON>. At the very top of the food chain are the humans who live close to nature in coastal villages. When Aleut natives complained that the oil spill kept them from gathering food through fishing and seal-hunting, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> flew in cases of beef, chicken and diced ham. It gave the villagers stomachaches. Many commercial fishermen have been idled by the spill, though some have landed jobs with <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>, leasing their boats at rates of $ 3,400 a day and more. Most of the salmon and halibut swimming beneath the oil appear to be surviving. But fisheries worth more than $ 110 million have been canceled or postponed by <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> officials worried that surface oil might taint fish as they are hauled from the water in fishermen's nets As spring turns to summer, even <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> officials are starting to waver on the question of finishing the cleanup by mid-September, a deadline long dismissed as unrealistic by some state and federal officials. `` It's always a hope,'' says <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Plante </PERSON>. `` But it's tougher to predict whether we'll do it by then. That's our plan. We've always said we will not leave it uncleaned, and if that means coming back, so be it. The sooner the better for all concerned _ particularly for 120 frisky sea otters now swimming restlessly in floating pens. They've beaten the odds, thanks to rescuers at an otter hospital in <LOCATION> Seward </LOCATION> The animals are clean, healthy and ready to return to the wild. But they must stay put, biologists say, because the wild is not ready for them.

 <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> voters face a measure Tuesday that urges <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to let the state halt shipments of raw logs overseas when domestic lumber mills are starving for timber and workers' jobs are jeopardized. The ballot proposal, called Measure 2, seeks to ban export of logs cut on state land and calls on <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to make permanent a ban of export of logs cut on federal land. Both supporters and opponents view Measure 2 as a symbolic test of the public will with jobs at mills jeopardized by both the high prices for raw logs and by environmentalist lawsuits aimed at protecting the rare Northern spotted owl and the ancient forests where they live. `` This is the first opportunity anybody in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has had to say ` We want timber jobs, we need timber jobs.' That's really the issue on Tuesday,'' said <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Stout </PERSON>, vice president for lands and timber for <ORGANIZATION> Bohemia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a lumber company in <LOCATION> Eugene </LOCATION> that has contributed $ 100,000 in support of Measure 2. But because of a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling on the same issue five years ago, the options of <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> voters are strictly limited. The high court ruled that only <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has the right to restrict trade, declaring an <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> law banning log exports unconstitutional. Because of the ruling, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would have to pass enabling legislation for the state export ban to become effective, even if it is passed Tuesday as most expect it will. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is seeking just the opposite, having proposed to lift a ban of exports of logs cut on federal land, currently in effect on a year-to-year basis, to take advantage of premium prices paid by log buyers in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. Within the timber industry itself, opinions are mixed. Many companies make money exporting unprocessed logs, while others are struggling obtain logs for their mills. The <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which opposes export restrictions, has decided to concentrate its efforts on defeating the enabling legislation in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, rather than seeking victory in Tuesday's referendum, said association executive director <PERSON> Rolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Glerum </PERSON>. `` We did n't feel we could raise the money to fight'' Measure 2, said <PERSON> Glerum </PERSON>. `` Even if we were to win it, it still would n't have any effect. The whole thing is triggered by the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' The group's members include <ORGANIZATION> Weyerhaeuser </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the leading exporter of raw logs in the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>, as well as stevedoring companies, shippers and the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Longshoremen </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Warehousemen </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. `` One reason we oppose this is we feel it is the camel's nose under the tent,'' said <PERSON> Glerum </PERSON>, because supporters `` would just as soon see all log exports banned.'' Indeed, a recent White Paper from the <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> pointed to stopping all log exports as a quick fix to the timber supply crunch that has plagued <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> mills the past year. <PERSON> Glerum </PERSON> and other opponents expect Measure 2 to pass. A recent poll by The Oregonian newspaper showed support running more than 8-to-1. A campaign spending report from May 26 showed Citizens to Save Oregon Jobs raised nearly $ 800,000 to push for passage, primarily from non-exporting timber companies. `` We're talking primarily about <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> logs for <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> jobs,'' said <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Amedeo </PERSON>, a lobbyist who serves on the steering committee for the campaign. `` The big battle, because it is a non-traditional election date, is to get enough voters to the polls. `` I think in terms of sending a message back to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, which is part of what the ballot measure does, the more people who vote, the more significant the message.'' State Rep. <PERSON> Bernie </PERSON> <PERSON> Agrons </PERSON> was one of the few voices in the Legislature opposing the measure. A former vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Weyerhaeuser </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Agrons </PERSON> said the measure would deprive the common school fund and counties of revenues from state timber. Last year, $ 12.5 million in state timber revenues went to the common school fund and $ 18.3 million went to local governments, predominantly schools. Export logs are generally considered to bring a premium price about 25 percent higher than domestic logs.

 Mayor <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> prepared to be sworn in Friday for an unprecedented fifth term, but investigations into his finances and ethics are putting a damper on party plans. The inaugural party, to be held on the south lawn of <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hall </LOCATION>, is expected to be `` a day of celebration and at the same time reflection,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON>, a mayoral spokesman. The 71-year-old <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> rose through the ranks of the police department and <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> to become the first black mayor of a major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> city when he defeated <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Yorty </PERSON> in 1973 following a bitter campaign. These days, <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> points with pride to the city's emergence as the gateway to the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rim </LOCATION>, as the successful host of the 1984 Summer Olympic games and to a downtown redevelopment effort. In April's non-partisan primary, he defeated City Councilman <PERSON> Nate </PERSON> <PERSON> Holden </PERSON> with 52 percent of the vote, just enough to avoid a general election. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> was expected to soar past <PERSON> Holden </PERSON>, but found himself wounded by disclosures about his financial ties with savings banks that do business with the city. Newspaper reports prompted the city attorney to begin a conflict-of-interest investigation on March 31. The state <ORGANIZATION> Fair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Political </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Practices </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> later joined the investigation. Deeper digging into <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>'s investments yielded questions about whether he had traded political favors for preferential treatment at <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION>, the investment banking firm. This in turn prompted inquiries by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. In a surprise address to the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> on May 10, the taciturn <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> said he made `` an error in judgment by engaging in outside employment.'' But <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> maintained he did nothing illegal, and said he expects to be vindicated in the still-pending inquiries. Since the speech, <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> has maintained silence about details of his investments, denying interview requests. The spurt of disclosures about <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> appears to have tapered off in recent weeks, although investigations apparently have gone in new directions. One trail, which ran to <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> investments by <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Majority Whip <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, led the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Democrat to resign. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>'s amalgam of labor, minority and business support has remained largely intact throughout the controversy, although his influence over the City Council has diminished. Some say one barometer of the mayor's strength is with his proposal to the council last year to raise the cap on <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Redevelopment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> spending downtown to $ 5 billion from $ 750 million. The money would be spent on revitalizating blighted parts of downtown; expanding child care, services for the homeless; and building affordable housing for low-income residents. The council is considering creating an oversight committee for the agency, cutting into the mayor's control. A hearing is scheduled for Tuesday to discuss how much power such a committee would have. Even <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>'s friends say the mayor does n't hold as much clout as he once did. `` There's no question that -LRB- <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> -RRB- has been tarnished by the many stories, some of which I regard as frivolous and some bordering on yellow journalism,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, executive secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> and a longtime <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> political ally. `` It's been my experience that politicians, and especially a powerful politician, when he's in trouble, the sharks smell the blood and they go for the jugular,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> has continued to support <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, calling him a `` person of high integrity.'' `` Judgments should n't be made until all the issues have all been thoroughly explored,'' he said. `` There is not a feeling that it's all over,'' <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> confidante <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Riordan </PERSON> said of the mayor's career. `` He's held his head up high through all of this.'' Still, <PERSON> Riordan </PERSON> conceded, `` You have a feeling underneath that he knows that he's walking more carefully and not twisting arms as forcefully as he might've in the past.''

 In a pinch, you can fly a plane. At least that's what instructors in a unique eight-hour flying course try to convince pilots' spouses and others who might be forced to fly and land a plane in an emergency. It is rare for a heart attack, food poisoning or other sudden illness to disable a pilot in mid-flight. But it happens once or twice a year, and sometimes with dramatic results as air traffic controllers help a novice find an airport and safely land. The ground school instructor in a recent course sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Owners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> asked <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, 52, of <LOCATION> Graysonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, how she felt about the prospect of taking the controls of her husband's <PERSON> Mooney </PERSON> 201. `` I'm scared to death,'' she said. But after four hours of flying with an instructor in the `` pinch-hitter'' course that has taught 35,000 non-pilots the fundamentals of flying, Mrs. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said, `` I feel a lot different about our little plane. I think I understand it better.'' While the course covers only small planes, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, who is in charge of flight instruction for the foundation, said that in the unlikely event an airliner's flying crew was disabled, he'd `` go with the odds'' and ask a trained pinch-hitter to take the controls. One student described herself as a former stewardess and said she took the course because `` if you can work the back end of a plane, you should be able to work the front end.'' Another trainee, <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Zuckerman </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Bradford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, told the class that after her husband's parents were killed in the crash of their small plane, her husband, <PERSON> David </PERSON>, stopped flying for more than 10 years. She bounced the family's <PERSON> Piper </PERSON> <PERSON> Archer </PERSON> twice on the runway before bringing it down undamaged with a little help from her pinch-hitter instructor. `` I thought it was nerve-wracking,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Zuckerman </PERSON> said. `` But I loved taking off. I never thought it was so easy and so much fun. I think I could land it if I had to.'' <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Scranton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, who survived a crash with her husband four years ago, said she thinks the course is a necessity for a pilot's wife. But after the crash it took him a while to convince her to take the class, she said. Once in the air, people who have never flown a plane find it deceptively simple. A push forward on the steering yoke and the aircraft descends. A pull back and it climbs. Steering left or right is almost like steering a car, but on the ground, steering is done by foot pedals, not the yoke. Engine speed is controlled with a hand throttle, but trainees often forget that putting the plane into a descent will also speed it up and climbing will slow it down. The four-hour ground school aims to build confidence, but it also includes a basic explanation of what makes a plane fly and a description of its parts and instruments. Started in 1961, the weekend course is taught about 20 times a year, each time at a different airport around the country. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Busch </PERSON>, flight training director for the foundation, said about a third of the trainees go on to get pilot licenses.

In 1983, pinch-hitter graduate <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> was in the right rear seat of her husband's plane when he suffered a heart attack and died. A 78-year-old woman, <PERSON> Edith </PERSON> <PERSON> Merrill </PERSON>, was sitting by the right-side controls, but the owners and pilots group gave Mrs. <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> an award for taking over the radio and coaching and assisting Mrs. <PERSON> Merrill </PERSON> through a safe landing. It takes 40 to 60 hours of flying to qualify for a regular pilot license and costs $ 3,500 to $ 4,000. The pinch-hitter training costs $ 240, not including use of an aircraft. Trainees are encouraged to use the plane they regularly ride in as a passenger, but they also may rent one. Ideally, the course culminates in the pinch-hitter landing the plane unassisted by the instructor. `` I'm not really sure how much control I had over the plane in that final landing,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said after completing the course. `` If, God help me, the time ever comes when I have to fly on my own, then ... well, <PERSON> God </PERSON> help me,'' she said.

<HEAD>Many Senators Cut Privately Funded Travel</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Senators facing re-election in 1990 have cut down on privately financed travel that sometimes takes them to pricey resorts, according to a study of financial disclosures. The group, comprising almost a third of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, took 179 privately financed trips in 1988 compared with 223 in 1987. Such travel _ usually paid for by corporate and trade associations _ has been severely criticized this year by members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and private organizations. The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> study of 33 senators was based on travel statistics compiled on the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Watch </ORGANIZATION>, an organization founded by consumer advocate <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nader </PERSON> that culled the data from 1988 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> financial disclosure reports filed last month. Senators are required to list all reimbursed travel expenses totaling at least $ 250. The lawmakers were not surveyed on why the number of trips dropped. While legal, the trips leave members in potential conflicts of interest involving special interest groups that are pushing for passage or defeat of legislation. The invitations often include airfare, several days at a resort or top-of-the-line hotel, and expenses for a spouse. Task forces in both houses are considering whether to eliminate speaking honoraria in return for a congressional pay raise, but an end of those fees _ up to $ 2,000 per speech _ would not necessarily prevent privately funded travel. `` Many of these junkets are designed to give lobbyists the chance to fraternize with lawmakers, frequently at pricey resorts, and provide special interest groups with yet another opportunity to gain access and influence with members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Claybrook </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Watch </ORGANIZATION>'s parent group, Public Citizen. Those who traveled frequently, however, probably have little to fear from the voters, according to two political scientists, <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Ornstein </PERSON> associated with the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurber </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` I do n't think it will be a devastatingly effective campaign weapon in 1990,'' said <PERSON> Ornstein </PERSON>, unless the travel has caused a senator to miss votes. `` You're going to have much more luck slamming a guy for doing it on public expense than at the expense of private interests,'' <PERSON> Ornstein </PERSON> said. `` The public reaction is, ` We do n't give a damn if it's taken out of special interests, but do n't take it out of our pockets.''' <PERSON> Thurber </PERSON> said there were few studies on voters' reaction to congressional trips, but added it was his `` gut reaction'' that the trips `` play almost no role in the way they evaluate the performance of a member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' The AP found that among those whose current six-year terms are winding down: _ Eighteen traveled on fewer privately paid trips in 1988 than in 1987, while 10 increased their travel and five had the same number of trips in both years The ratio becomes 18-9 in favor of reduced travel when <PERSON> Sens </PERSON>. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>, D-Colo., and <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, are subtracted from the list Both have announced their retirement. _ The gap in the number of trips is greater, 164 in 1988 compared with 223 in 1987, without Sen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> McClure </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Idaho </LOCATION>, who listed no trips in 1987 and 15 in 1988 _ Six senators facing re-election were among the top 15 privately financed travelers in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> They are Democrats <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, 24 trips; <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Exon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, 23 trips, <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, 21 trips; <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, 21 trips; and Republicans <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, 24 trips, and <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, 21 trips.

 Communist rebels raided a mountain village in a remote area of <LOCATION> Mindanao </LOCATION> island and massacred about 30 people as they worshipped in a <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> church, the military said Monday. The raiders beheaded three people, including a <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> minister, before fleeing, the report said. Lt. Col. <PERSON> Cresencio </PERSON> <PERSON> Maralit </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constabulary </ORGANIZATION>, said the incident occurred early Sunday in the village of <LOCATION> Rano </LOCATION>, about 640 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Maralit </PERSON> said many of the villagers had joined an anti-Communist vigilante group and had refused to pay `` revolutionary taxes'' to the communist <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. According to <PERSON> Maralit </PERSON>, about 40 members of the <PERSON> Ubo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bagobo </PERSON> tribes had gathered inside a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION> chapel for morning worship when about 100 guerrillas arrived. Guerrillas exchanged gunfire for about 15 minutes with members of the congregation, who were armed, <PERSON> Maralit </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Maralit </PERSON> identified the dead pastor as <PERSON> Abadi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ayap </PERSON>. But a denomination official in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> said records indicated no such pastor by that name. Bishop <PERSON> Erme </PERSON> <PERSON> Camba </PERSON>, secretary-general of the denomination, said the victim could have been a lay pastor. The bishop said he was still trying to verify the report. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION> has been widely criticized by the military for alleged links with <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> rebels because of the denomination's outspoken stand on human rights. In the past, most beheadings in <LOCATION> Mindanao </LOCATION> have been carried out by religious fanatics who are frequently used by the military to fight the Communists.

 At 400 pounds, Sen. <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> was the weightiest person ever to serve in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, a Democrat who served first in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, then in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, was so heavy he had difficulty finding a carriage driver willing to take the risk of hauling all those pounds. Once, wrote <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON> <PERSON> Bassett </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s assistant doorkeeper for much of the 19th century, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> `` got into a hack and went right through the bottom, onto the ground _ and if the horses had not been very tame he would have been killed.'' Sen. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> _ and the extreme rotundity of his profile _ is presiding this summer over the marble-clad rotunda of the <ORGANIZATION> Russell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Office Building, looming from a balcony in the form of a giant, shadow-casting silhouette. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> and the silhouettes of six of his senatorial colleagues of his era form the somewhat whimsical background of an exhibit illustrating the triumph and travail experienced by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in its first 100 years, 1789-1889. Born in 1802, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> served in the House for 15 years. He was appointed to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 1844, dying four years later. <PERSON> Bassett </PERSON>, who made good use of his powers of observation during his 60 years of service to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, noted that <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> rarely rose from his specially constructed and commodious chair to address the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bassett </PERSON> wrote that <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> told him the reason `` was that he was so big and fat that I would have to fan him, and it would not look very dignified in such a body as the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>.'' But if <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> was an infrequent speaker, he did listen intently to the major addresses of others. On Jan. 26, 1830, he walked across the Capitol and joined the throng crowding into the chamber of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, determined to hear Sen. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> defend the federal union. The `` enormous'' congressman was given a seat in the tiny lobby behind the presiding officer's chair where he became wedged in by other spectators. Because he was separated from the chamber by a painted glass screen, he could hear <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> but could not see him. Describing the scene, <PERSON> Bassett </PERSON> said the frustrated congressman `` deliberately pulled out his knife and removed the obstructing paint on the glass.'' But the operation `` caused quite a noise,'' <PERSON> Bassett </PERSON> said. `` Everybody was looking to see where that scratching came from.'' Finally, <PERSON> Bassett </PERSON> said, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> cleared an area `` as large as a man's hand,'' obtaining a `` good view'' of the famous <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>. The senatorial silhouettes, originally made on paper during the 1840s and 1850s and now reproduced larger than life, bring together an unuusal cast of characters. Joining <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> in larger-than-life profile is, for example, Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Randolph </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, a thin, stick-like figure described as `` one of the most brilliant, deranged and pathetic men ever to serve in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Randolph </PERSON> was known to stride into the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> followed by a pack of hunting hounds while flicking a riding crop and drinking a cup of beer. Abusive in speech, he once provoked a duel with Sen. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Clay </PERSON> from which both men emerged unscathed. <PERSON> Randolph </PERSON> lived to be 99, dying in 1833 just days before his 100th birthday. Also on the railing above the rotunda floor is a far less colorful lawmaker, Sen. <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Grundy </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, who was described by doorkeeper <PERSON> Bassett </PERSON> as a consummate insider and master of parliamentary tactics. Near <PERSON> Grundy </PERSON> is Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Forsyth </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> who cut a more visible public swath with blistering oratory and cutting wit. Informed that President <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s opponents were forming the new Whig party, <PERSON> Forsyth </PERSON> remarked: `` It is a glorious name, and I have no doubt they will disgrace it.''

<TEXT>
 The Holy Grail may not exist but it's a proven moneymaker. Scholars say the makers of the blockbuster movie `` Indiana <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> and the Last Crusade'' are just the latest to cash in on the search for the impossible icon. A 12th century abbot was the first to claim he had found the cup that <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> used at the Last Supper, and his monastery became the wealthiest in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, according to <PERSON> Eckehard </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, professor of Germanic medieval literature at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. The Grail has since inspired romantic poems in several languages, a <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> opera and even a Monty Python movie. But it had n't been a subject for archaeologists until filmmakers <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Spielberg </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> decided to dispatch their swashbuckling searcher for antiquities played by <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>. In the movie, Dr. <PERSON> Indiana </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> sets out in search of his father -LRB- <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Connery </PERSON> -RRB-, who has disappeared while hunting for the Holy Grail. Together, they outsmart <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> plunderers who are after the Grail because they believe anyone who drinks from it will gain immortality. The truth about the Holy Grail is tangled in centuries of legend, stretching from the Druids to <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>. `` Indiana Jones'' screenwriter <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Boam </PERSON> said the different strands of Grail lore were so contradictory he chose among them and made up the rest. The three knights guarding the cup are <PERSON> Boam </PERSON>'s creation, for example, as is the notion that the Grail could not be taken from its resting place in an ancient temple in <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. There is, however, some evidence that the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> were interested in the Grail. <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> used it in speeches as a metaphor for Aryan racial purity. <PERSON> Boam </PERSON> said <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> discovered <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s interest in occult artifacts while making `` Raiders of the Lost Ark.'' <PERSON> Boam </PERSON>'s research turned up reports that the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> had looted a monastery in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in hopes of finding the Grail. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> and other scholars said the Grail myth flourished in 12th century <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, though it has roots in earlier Celtic mythology. According to the legend, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> of Arimathea used the chalice from which <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> served the wine at the Last Supper to catch his blood during the crucifixion. The apocryphal story has it that <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> eventually brought the Grail to the monastery of <LOCATION> Glastonbury </LOCATION> _ a tale the abbot of <LOCATION> Glastonbury </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Blois </PERSON>, promoted. `` If you had a precious relic, people would come on pilgrimages,'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said. `` They also managed to fabricate the story that King <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> was buried there, and also that they had Excalibur,'' <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON>'s sword. `` It was a tremendous publicity stunt, and it made <LOCATION> Glastonbury </LOCATION> the single wealthiest monastery in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> until the Reformation,'' he added. Grail tales also were written in medieval French and German. One legend had the Grail coming to rest in the south of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, and by the 15th century, a <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> king had a collection of grail cups, according to popular book on the subject, `` Holy Blood, Holy Grail.'' A German version inspired <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> to write the opera `` Parsifal'' in 1882. Hollywood took up the trail in 1954, when <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> played a sculptor who made the cup for <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> in `` The Silver Chalice.'' There is, however, no evidence the Grail existed, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said. The Metropolitan Museum of Art in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> does have a figured silver cup that was once said to be the Grail. The <ORGANIZATION> Antioch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chalice </ORGANIZATION>, discovered in <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> in about 1910, was exhibited at the 1938 World's Fair, said curator <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayward </PERSON> of the Cloisters, which once owned it But the chalice was made 500 years after <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>' birth, and scholars never believed the claims, she said. Still, the Grail persists as a symbol of purity, faith and resurrection. `` The Holy Grail has come to take on a far greater meaning than the object itself,'' said <PERSON> Boam </PERSON>. `` It stands in for perfection, or any goal people might have.''

The special <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee focused on <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, the country's largest independent oil purchaser, at a May 10 hearing in which witnesses said <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> employees purposely mismeasured oil from wells on Indian lands In a 57-page statement issued June 8, <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said the committee `` unjustly defamed <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> and caused severe damage to its reputation and business.'' The 49-year-old company said the figures the committee used in its allegations were inaccurate, and that comparisons with other companies were based on noncomparable statistics. The committee used `` anecdotal evidence which was misleading at best and false at worst'' at the hearing, the Koch statement said. But <PERSON> Hirsch </PERSON> said the committee stands by its findings. `` The committee's investigators caught <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> employees in the act of stealing oil on six separate occasions,'' he said. `` Koch gaugers and supervisors also admitted to committee investigators that it was company policy to mismeasure oil.'' <PERSON> Hirsch </PERSON> said documents the committee subpoenaed from <LOCATION> Koch </LOCATION> and almost 30 other companies corroborated the committee's findings. He said the committee will review <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>'s June 8 statement before making its final report, sometime this fall. The special committee has been investigating all areas of Indian affairs and came upon the <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> case while probing federal agencies assigned to protecting Indian lands.

<HEAD>Lobbyists Vying to Represent Zaire President in US</HEAD>

 <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Mobotu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sese </PERSON> <PERSON> Seko </PERSON>'s poor human rights record is n't deterring <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lobbyists from scrambling to represent the wealthy leader, who visits <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> this week. `` People see <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> as the gold at the end of the rainbow,'' said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Kloberg </PERSON>, whose lobbying and public relations firm recently signed a two-year contract to lobby for <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> government interests at $ 300,000. The effort to win <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON>'s approval provides a glimpse into the often-murky world of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lobbyists, where high-priced public relations consultants compete to put the best face on foreign leaders and businesses. <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> has reputedly amassed a large personal fortune during the 24 years he has ruled <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>. He is an appealing target for entrepreneurs claiming they can open doors for him in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and get him favorable media coverage despite <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>'s poor human rights record and allegations of widespread corruption. `` People promise <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> they can change things here for him, open doors, and then they ca n't deliver,'' said <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Kloberg </PERSON>, who represents several Third World countries with unpopular reputations in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. His company has been seeking to bolster congressional support in advance of the <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> visit, especially in light of the shrinking budget for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The competition to represent foreign leaders sometimes leaves congressional staffers and <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials confused, such as when they were told several months ago by two rival lobbying firms that each was organizing <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON>'s visit. Their confusion was compounded when it transpired that the better known and more prestigious of the two _ the partnership of Black, <PERSON> Manafort </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Stone </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> _ had not been picked. But officials at that company say they are still negotiating to represent <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON>. Lobbyists representing foreign governments must register with the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, where the files show that many contracts to represent <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> lasted only a year. It's not unusual for governments to switch lobbyists, but the turnover rate for <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> is believed to be particularly high. One company, <ORGANIZATION> Weaver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION>, was paid $ 500,000 just to promote foreign investment in <LOCATION> flora </LOCATION> and fauna culture projects in <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>. Aside from the paid lobbyists, there is a network of unpaid officials, many of them businessmen, who know <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> and take on tasks for him. One example is <PERSON> Mamadi </PERSON> <PERSON> Diane </PERSON>, whose company has a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government contract to ship food aid to several African countries. <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> helped set up a recent visit to <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> by 17 black mayors of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cities. The trip, paid for by <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>'s government, may have done more damage than good. It incurred the wrath of many black mayors opposed to <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON>'s repressive tactics and his ties with the white government of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>`Taxpayer Bill of Rights' Takes Effect This Week</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Individuals and businesses will have more legal protection in disputes with the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, under provisions of the `` Taxpayer Bill of Rights'' taking effect this week. Starting on Saturday, the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> will have to provide more advance notice before acting to seize property for back taxes, and more wages and property will be exempt from seizure. Starting July 7, taxpayers may appeal to block a seizure that was erroneously filed by the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION>. The provisions that take effect this week are aimed at helping taxpayers who owe delinquent taxes and are subject to <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> collection procedures. Other parts of the new law already are in operation. Key provisions require the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> to provide taxpayers a written statement of their rights, prohibit the agency from promoting employees on the basis of how much money they collect, and require the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> to drop any penalty that resulted from a taxpayer relying on written advice from the agency. The bill of rights was enacted last October after congressional committees compiled evidence of abuses by some <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> officials and denial of basic rights to taxpayers. Although most taxpayers will never have a need for the new law, since they will never be audited or receive a notice of delinquent taxes, those who do run afoul of the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> may find it tips the balance a bit more in their favor. Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON>, D-Ark., chief author of the law, once called it a measure `` basically geared for that small business, that mom-and-pop drugstore down on the corner, that someday might get behind a little behind with their taxes or might want to say that ` I want to go in to the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> and admit a mistake that I just found''' without being penalized The accounting firm of <PERSON> Pannell </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerr </PERSON> <PERSON> Forster </PERSON> put it another way: `` The Taxpayer Bill of Rights is an attempt to balance the rights and responsibilities in tax matters.'' Here are the key provisions about to take effect: _ The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> will have to notify a taxpayer 30 days before filing a notice that it intends to `` levy'' or seize wages, bank accounts or other property The old law required only a 10-day notice. If the taxes are still unpaid and the taxpayer has not worked out an installment payment plan when the 30 days are up, the notice may be issued without further notification. _ A bank must wait 21 days after receiving notice before turning an account over to the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> After that period, the bank is free to hand over the money plus interest earned during the delay. However, the bank may not give the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> more than the total of the levy. The agency noted that it has been automatically delaying seizures in cases in which there is any doubt as to the actual owner of the account. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> imposed this rule on itself after the widely publicized seizure of a child's small bank account that was listed with a parent's Social Security number. _ Up to $ 1,550 worth of food, fuel, furniture and personal household effects will be exempt from levy, an increase of $ 50 Also, $ 1,050 worth of a worker's `` tools of the trade'' are exempt -LRB- up from $ 1,000 -RRB-. The new law shields from seizure a bigger portion of a worker's wages, equal to the total of his or her standard deduction and personal exemptions divided by 52. _ If a taxpayer believes a lien was filed erroneously _ for example, because the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> did not follow the law or the delinquency was paid off before the lien was filed _ it may be appealed However, there is no appeal if the taxpayer simply disputes the amount of alleged delinquency. _ The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> can be sued for actual damages if the agency knowingly or negligently fails to remove a tax lien when required

<HEAD>North Trial Judge Faces Decision on Juror Issue</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The judge in <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s Iran-Contra case faces a decision remarkably similar to one he made a decade ago in a case where a juror withheld significant information from the court. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> has scheduled a hearing for Wednesday focusing on North trial juror <PERSON> Tara </PERSON> <PERSON> Leigh </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s failure to disclose that four of her brothers and sisters had been involved with the courts. In a 1978 city corruption case, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> ordered a new trial for a top mayoral aide and parking lot magnate after it was disclosed that a juror had a checking account at a bank founded by the magnate, <PERSON> Dominic </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonelli </PERSON>. <PERSON> Antonelli </PERSON> and his co-defendant were acquitted in the retrial. The juror also had failed to tell defense lawyers that her father worked for <PERSON> Antonelli </PERSON>'s firm and had been fired from the company. The juror said she had n't known of his employment at <PERSON> Antonelli </PERSON>'s firm, although she acknowledged knowing her father was employed by another parking company in town. In the North case, King responded negatively on a pre-trial questionnaire when asked whether she or any members of her immediate family had ever been involved in a court proceeding or in an investigation. One brother had pleaded guilty to armed robbery. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> ordered <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyers, who raised the allegations of juror misconduct against King, to prepare a detailed account of when they learned of the information. The prosecution says that under federal court rulings a defendant may not learn of alleged juror misconduct during a trial, `` gamble on a favorable verdict by remaining silent,'' and then complain in a post-trial motion. North was convicted May 4 of aiding and abetting an obstruction of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, destroying government documents and accepting a $ 13,800 home security system as an illegal gratuity from <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>. North had enlisted <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> to secretly run arms to the Contras. North's sentencing has been postponed until July 5 pending a decision on the matter. In the 1978 case before <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>, <PERSON> Antonelli </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeldell </PERSON>, an aide to <LOCATION> then-Washington </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>, had been convicted of conspiring to arrange a government lease of a building from a partnership controlled by <PERSON> Antonelli </PERSON>. <PERSON> Antonelli </PERSON> and <PERSON> Yeldell </PERSON>, now the director of the city's office of emergency preparedness, were found innocent of bribery and conspiracy in their second trial before a federal court jury in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> presided in that trial as well. <PERSON> Antonelli </PERSON> was represented by <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> of the firm <ORGANIZATION> Williams </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON>, the same law firm representing North.

<HEAD>Florida's Novel Gun Safety Measure Raises Question of Enforcement</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Threatening to lock up adults who do n't lock up guns sends a strong message, but police and prosecutors question whether a first-of-its kind bill approved in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> will prevent accidental shootings `` We do feel there will be some difficulty in enforcement since it will take a child committing some dreadful act before law enforcement becomes aware that he or she had access to a weapon,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Berlinger </PERSON>, director of operations for the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Monroe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> State Attorney <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Zuelch </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prosecuting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Attorneys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, also expressed concern that `` the prevention issue has n't been totally dealt with.'' Accidental shootings that killed three children since June 5 prompted the Legislature to pass the bill during a special session Tuesday. Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> is expected to sign the measure into law this week. Gun owners who fail to secure loaded weapons in homes or businesses could face charges if children ages 15 and younger hurt someone with the firearms. The maximum penalty under the bill would be five years in prison and a $ 5,000 fine. Lesser penalties would apply if the child brandishes the gun in public or threatens others with it. The bill exempts police officers and military personnel and does not apply in cases where the guns were obtained illegally, such as a burglary. The bill requires gun-shop owners to post a sign explaining the law and to give customers a written warning. The measure also directs the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> to develop a gun-safety education program that lawmakers can consider by next spring. Gun lobbyists were divided in their appraisal of the legislation. `` What they've got now is a public relations bill,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Berger </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Sarasota </LOCATION> resident who has urged passage of a stricter version of the legislation since March 1987 when his 9-year-old stepson was accidentally killed by a friend. <PERSON> Berger </PERSON> was disappointed that the bill filed by Rep. <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>, a retired <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> colonel, was `` watered down,'' but said getting a weaker version passed was still `` a battle won in that I know parents ... went out and bought a padlock.'' <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Horn </PERSON>, state legislative director of <ORGANIZATION> Handgun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, called the bill a significant victory that would quickly save lives. `` It makes people understand what's expected of them when they keep a loaded gun in the house with children,'' <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> said. Gun-shop owners in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> say locks and safety boxes have gone from being overlooked accessories to one of the most sought-after items since lawmakers passed the law. But <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardiner </PERSON>, who directs state and local legislative affairs for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said the bill only repeats what is already covered in criminal negligence laws throughout the country. `` We do n't have any objection with it ... because it does n't change anything,'' he said <PERSON> Gardiner </PERSON> said there's no need for the bill anywhere. He said the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> would look at laws that may be proposed in other states individually. Handgun Control plans to promote the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> bill as model legislation around the country, according to <PERSON> Horn </PERSON>. The organization is chaired by <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, wife of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s Press Secretary <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, who was shot in the 1981 assassination attempt on <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. A call for similar gun-control action was made Friday by <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> Lt. Gov. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> McCallum </PERSON> following a rash of shootings in that state. Lawmakers from about a dozen states have expressed interest in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s legislation, according to <PERSON> Horn </PERSON>. `` I'm sure that this is going to be introduced in quite a number of legislatures,'' <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> said. `` And what's the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> going to do? They ca n't say, ` Oh, it's not a good law for <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>' when they agreed to it in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>.'' Firearms are the fourth leading cause of accidental deaths in children under age 16, according to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, a private non-profit organization. Automobile accidents, drownings and fires are the top three.

<HEAD>USDA, States Help Promote Organic Farming</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Advocates of organic farming are generous in their praise, saying it is a way for crop producers to make money and save the environment at the same time. Even the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which had been rather stodgy about producing wheat, corn, soybeans, vegetables and other crops with reduced or eliminated doses of chemicals has adjusted. Numerous conferences and research efforts have marked <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s new journey into organic farming, but it was <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in the 1985 farm law that really gave the department its marching orders, along with a $ 4 million appropriation later on. The department even used a new term _ Low Input Sustainable Agriculture, or LISA _ to include what had been loosely referred to as organic, sustainable or alternative methods of farming. Comparatively, <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> is doing much more today in programs to help small farmers and to assist both large and small producers find alternative methods of production. By using less commercial fertilizer and pesticides, it is hoped that producers can reduce costs and thereby improve profits. But a Washington-based, non-profit advocacy group, the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> in the Public Interest, says organic and low-chemical farming `` is flourising at the state level'' while the federal effort is moving slowly. A new study by the center found that half the states have `` significant activities to promote sustainable agriculture,'' including strong efforts in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. `` Here in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, proponents have to scratch and claw just to hang on to a tiny $ 4.45 million sustainable agriculture program that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration and the chemical lobby want to kill,'' said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Howell </PERSON>, author of the center's report. `` In contrast,'' he said, `` states are spending more money on a greater variety of ambitious programs to increase the production and marketing of foods grown with few or no synthetic pesticides and fertilizers.'' Other studies by advocates of low-input agriculture support claims that crop yields often are comparable to those from chemically treated land after a practice has been established and crop rotation carried out. But <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Kleckner </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` If it were as simple as reducing purchased inputs and reaping the rewards, it would have been in practice years ago.'' Farmers are willing to adopt proven methods that result from the low-input concept, he recently told a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> agriculture subcommittee. But the technology must be based on more than a whim and a promise. `` Farmers can not afford to take big risks with a new and unproven technology,'' <PERSON> Kleckner </PERSON> said. `` As we see it, LISA programs represent a long-term goal for agriculture.'' <PERSON> Kleckner </PERSON> said some aspects of <ORGANIZATION> LISA </ORGANIZATION> have shown good results, such as `` integrated pest management'' to reduce the amount of pesticides on crops by being more selective and careful about timing during the season. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, he said, pest management reduced the amount of pesticide used on apples by 38 percent and on onions by 31 percent. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> farmers were able to reduce pesticide use on carrots by 66 percent and on cabbage by 44 percent. At present, <PERSON> Kleckner </PERSON> said, low-input farming `` is still more a philosophy and spirit of farming than an easily defined set of principles.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has some summer advice about dogs and cats. `` That old bromide about hot weather discomfort tells us that horses sweat and men perspire, and ladies gently glow,'' says the department's <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inspection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` If you're a pet owner, however, you should know that dogs and cats do none of the above. Instead, they pant. And agency experts say that can lead to deadly consequences if left unchecked. `` Each year, hundreds of pets die of heat, usually because their owners just are n't aware of how quickly heat can kill,'' said veterinarian <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwindaman </PERSON>, who heads the agency's animal care staff. `` If you leash your dog outside, make certain it can move easily to a shady spot. Make plenty of water available to it as well, especially if you'll be away from home for long periods.'' Pets should never be left unattended in a vehicle, he said. And cracking a window an inch or two will not adequately protect an animal. Heat in a car can rise to 160 degrees in a very short time. As for car trips, <PERSON> Schwindaman </PERSON> said that for a highly nervous animal even a brief ride can be a severe strain in hot weather. `` This is especially true if your pet is an indoor cat or dog who would be frightened simply by the surroundings and noise of an unfamiliar environment,'' he said. `` In this case, if the trip is absolutely necessary, the pet owner should make every effort to transport the animal in an air-conditioned vehicle.''

 An <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report shows that catfish production continues to rise unabated, with May production up 42 percent from a year earlier to 28.9 million pounds. Through the first five months of 1989, production was 141.2 million pounds, a 15 percent increase from the same period of last year, the report said. Despite the larger output, catfish farmers are getting more for their product, averaging 76 cents per pound in May, up a penny from a year ago.

 Telling your chihuahua to chill out might be easier if you fed it `` Frosty Paws,'' a new ice cream for pampered pooches.

 Zoning officials did n't object to the golden pyramid or the shark-filled moat.

The town took him to court under a zoning ordinance that puts a 25-foot limit on structures in residential neighborhoods.

<HEAD>Non-nursing Mothers Don't Need Anti-Swelling Medication, FDA Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Federal health officials are concerned that each year more than 700,000 non-nursing mothers are being put needlessly at risk with prescriptions for drugs and hormones to prevent painful breast swelling. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> plans to meet soon with several pharmaceutical companies to ask them to stop marketing the medications to prevent breast engorgement after childbirth. An <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> advisory council concluded earlier this month that mild painkillers and breast-binding are as effective as these medications in easing the discomfort and carry none of the health risks. `` Nature takes care of the problem very quickly,'' usually within two or three days after childbirth, said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> psychologist who is on the advisory panel. Yet, doctors are treating the condition with medications that have to be taken for two weeks, she said. `` Why are we subjecting women to this if after a few days it will resolve itself anyway?'' she said. Panel members also said evidence showed that only about 10 percent of women who do n't breast-feed have significant pain in their breasts from the accumulation of milk. But, they said, even these women can be treated without drugs and hormones. <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Corfman </PERSON>, executive secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> council </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>'s supervisory medical officer for fertility and maternal health drugs, said voluntary compliance by the pharmaceutical companies is the first and preferred step. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> is n't seeking to ban the drugs and hormones. The medications have other FDA-approved uses for which medical specialists agree they are valuable. But the agency may meet resistance from the companies. Although some of the companies said they have not been contacted by the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> and would not comment on the impending request, their leaders defend the safety and effectiveness of their products. <ORGANIZATION> Sandoz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pharmaceuticals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hanover </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, which makes bromocriptine, sold under the name <ORGANIZATION> Parlodel </ORGANIZATION> and the most widely used of the medications, proposed to the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> revised package inserts to inform physicians of alternative therapies and brochures to educate women. `` We feel it should be a free choice by an informed patient and her physician,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Winter </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Sandoz </ORGANIZATION>. About 40 percent of women who give birth do n't breast-feed, and <PERSON> Winter </PERSON> said a company study found that 36 percent of these women have pain in their breasts after delivery. Bromocriptine has been taken by more than 4 million women during the nine years it has been on the market, and though it has been found to cause minor side effects _ including nausea and dizziness _ no serious adverse effects have been proven, he said. Critics, however, note that there have been a small number of reports of heart attacks, strokes and seizures associated with use of the drug. Use of estrogen and androgen hormones and their combinations have been shown to raise the risk of blood clots, <PERSON> Corfman </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Merrell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pharmaceuticals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, defended the safety of <ORGANIZATION> TACE </ORGANIZATION>, an estrogen marketed by the company. The company has had four reports of blood-clotting problems, but none has been reported since 1975, he said. `` If there are patients who are suffering that can not be relieved in other ways, the drug works and it is safe and it is another product for physicians to prescribe,'' he said.

<HEAD>Study Finds Population Pressure Leads to Political Turmoil</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Population pressures threaten to disrupt political and social conditions in many nations, according to a new study that finds <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> the world's most stable nation and <LOCATION> Mauritania </LOCATION> the most unstable. The report from the private <ORGANIZATION> Population </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crisis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, released Sunday, put the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the `` moderate'' category, losing ground to 16 countries rated as more stable because of this nation's ethnic conflicts and high rate of youth unemployment The analysis by <ORGANIZATION> Sharon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> L. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Camp </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON> and <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnett </PERSON> noted that `` rapid population growth, especially when overlaid with sharp ethnic divisions, places enormous strains on political institutions.'' `` Not surprisingly the two most deeply troubled areas of the globe are <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, with the world's highest growth rates,'' commented <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, a retired ambassador. The analysis was compiled by rating a variety of factors and totaling the results. Population growth rates, movement to urban areas, the age structure of populations, growth of the labor force and presence or absence of ethnic and language division in a country were the major population factors considered. The study took into account changes in government over the last 30 years or so, political freedoms, civil liberties, ethnic or religious conflicts and an estimate of the satisfaction or frustration of youth in a country. <LOCATION> Mauritania </LOCATION>, situated astride the <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION> desert and the dry Sahel steppe region in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, led the list for instability with a 95 score out of a possible 100. It also ranked high in separate population pressure rankings, scoring 71 out of 100. Rounding out the five most unstable nations were <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, scoring 87; <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>, 83; and <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>, 81 each. All five have been through several governments and all but <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> scored the maximum in communal violence, with bitter conflicts underway in several of these countries. All five also ranked high in the study of population pressures. On the 100-point instability scale, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> accumulated only 13 points and was also near the bottom of the population pressures study. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, by comparison, accumulated 31 points in the instability analysis. Both nations managed a top ranking of 1 point for government changes, political and civil rights. In the category of ethnic and religious conflicts, however, while <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> had one point the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was given 10 of a possible 20. And, in the dissatisfied youth category, unemployment hurt the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, which scored 18 out of 40 possible points, compared with 9 points for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Countries falling between <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> were <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, 18; <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, 20; <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, 21 each; <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, 22 each; <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, 23; <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, 24; <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, 25; <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>, 28; <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, 29; and <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION>, 30 each. Tied with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> at a rating of 31 were <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. The committee, which advocates family planning, said, `` It is clear from trends widely evident in the world that rapid growth of a country's population, along with its maldistribution, will impose great strains on existing political, social and economic structures and on relations between nations.'' Of 120 countries studied, 101 showed a relationship between population pressures and political stability, the group concluded. It said only a handful of governments with rapid population growth have maintained stable governments with good records on civil and political rights, notably <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Gambia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, where student attempts to promote democracy recently ended in military violence, scored a 57 rating on the index, placing it in the `` high'' category for instability. That score may be too low in light of recent events, the committee said in an addendum issued with the report.

<HEAD>Flush Or Be Fined</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KENNETH L. WHITING</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SINGAPORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In their latest move to toilet train the people, authorities plan to fine those who fail to flush after using public lavatories. Beginning July 1, first-time offenders may be penalized as much as $ 77. Repeat offenders caught neglecting to flush three or more times may have to pay as much as $ 515. Public toilets are defined as those to which the public has access, including those in hotels, department stores, cinemas and restaurants. The Environment Ministry says many people simply are not flushing after use. Government campaigns to improve public hygiene in this city-state of 2.6 million people are not new. A Clean Public Toilets campaign was first mounted in 1983. A team of health inspectors was deployed last year, but offenders merely received warning letters. The deteriorating state of public toilets and anti-social bathroom behavior receive much attention in this country, which uses the slogan `` clean and green'' to describe itself. A survey of 3,550 public toilets turned up `` a problem of users showing no consideration for the next person,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lim </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Environment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Straits </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> newspaper last year targeted `` toilets of shame,'' singling out by name, photograph and location `` particularly disgusting facilities.'' Both the newspaper and the <ORGANIZATION> Environment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> installed telephone hotlines for complaints. Many apartment blocks have become high-rise slums with elevators reeking of urine and corridors filled with trash. The elevator problem became so bad that the <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> installed a sophisticated monitoring system in some buildings. Sensors activated by the high salt content in urine stop the elevator, activate a video camera hidden in the ceiling and alert the janitor. The trapped offender is supposed to be turned over to police. Dozens of culprits, aged from 7 to 79 and including at least one woman, have been flushed out so far. They face a fine of $ 1,030, three years in jail and a flogging of from three to eight lashes.

<HEAD>Majority Leader Sees No Need To Reopen Investigation</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Some questions about the Iran-Contra affair may never be answered, although new details may come out in the upcoming trials of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> and Gen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>, says <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s report on why some <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> documents on the Iran-Contra affair were not turned over to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> does not warrant reopening the overall inquiry, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said Sunday. `` There is no basis at this time, in my judgment, for a resumption of the investigation or for the creation of a new investigation,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. `` Obviously, there are loose ends,'' he said in an interview on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Meet the Press.'' `` Not every single question has been answered and every one may not be answered,'' said the majority leader, who served on the special Iran-Contra investigating committee. `` But there comes a question of balance in terms of whether one should or should not reopen the investigation.'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said more about <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s role in the funneling of proceeds from arms sales to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to the Contras likely will surface during the trials of <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, who succeeded <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> as national security adviser, and <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> general. The <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> Democrat had asked the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel to examine why congressional investigators never saw the six previously undisclosed White House memos when copies surfaced during the trial of former national security aide <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>. The intelligence panel reported Friday that the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> sometimes handled documents in a chaotic and haphazard manner when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> sought them for its Iran-Contra hearings two years ago. But the committee said there was no evidence of a calculated cover-up by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. Among those documents was a Feb. 19, 1985, memo to former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> from then-National Security Adviser <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>. The memo recommended that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> write Honduran President <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Suazo </PERSON> to reaffirm <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for Contra rebels in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and pledge <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> help in defending <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> if Nicaraguan troops crossed its border. Located in an informal `` heads of state'' file in a box of papers at <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s presidential library in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, the document suggested a `` quid pro quo'' arrangement with <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> that has been denied by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. At the time, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had banned direct <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to the Contras.

 <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> members are looking for money in the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget to keep a new helicopter and a new fighter, and lawmakers say funds intended for the B-2 bomber and Star Wars are likely targets. The <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> will be working this week on the $ 295.6 billion <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget, and Rep. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bustamante </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, said some of the money `` has to come out of the system.'' He predicted B-2 funds will be cut and that `` SDI -LRB- Strategic Defense Initiative -RRB- will take a big hit _ $ 1.6 billion to $ 1.8 billion.'' Several committee members are seeking restoration of money for the V-22 Osprey helicopter and the F-14D Tomcat fighter jet, both slated for burial in <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>'s proposed budget. Reps. <PERSON> Sonny </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>, D-Miss., and <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Leath </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, plan to introduce an amendment Tuesday that would provide an additional $ 1.2 billion for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and reserves The current $ 69 billion procurement budget earmarks about 3 percent for reserve forces, <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> said. Reps. <PERSON> Curt </PERSON> <PERSON> Weldon </PERSON>, R-Pa., and <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Foglietta </PERSON>, D-Pa., meanwhile, have convinced members of the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> research and development subcommittee to save the Marine V-22 Osprey with $ 351 million that had been earmarked for the B-2 In closed session, the panel voted 11-7 to approve the amendment, according to <PERSON> Weldon </PERSON> and Foglietta. The Osprey, the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>' revolutionary tilt-rotor aircraft that takes off like a helicopter but can fly like a plane, has widespread support in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, especially among former <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION> and members from <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> where the Osprey is built by <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Helicopter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Helicopter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Textron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Opponents of the stealth bomber, considered the most expensive in history at a cost of between $ 500 million and $ 650 million a copy, sounded off against that program last week. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, appealed to <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION> to suspend production because the B-2 has yet to undergo flight testing. The estimated fiscal 1990 cost for the B-2 is $ 4.7 billion and over a three-year peak spending period the pricetag is $ 24 billion. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> has produced a B-2 program that wo n't fly financially,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Wis </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> The Pentagon has invested about $ 22.4 billion in the B-2 program, which is expected to cost about $ 70 billion to complete. <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION> indicated last week that initial flight tests of the bomber will be conducted by the end of the summer. In addition to focusing on B-2 funds, members are looking at the proposed $ 4.9 billion for <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wars </ORGANIZATION>, formally known as the Strategic Defense Initiative. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridge </PERSON>, R-Pa., joined with 31 Republicans and Democrats earlier in this month in calling for $ 3.1 billion for <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wars </ORGANIZATION> in fiscal 1990 rather than the $ 4.9 billion proposed by the administration `` Our amendment will help restore that balance. It will mean more tanks, more planes and more ships while providing for a robust SDI program,'' <PERSON> Ridge </PERSON> said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> has reportedly halted or is reviewing payments to nine mortgage companies that finance federally backed housing in its coinsurance program.

Coinsurance permits private lenders to earn lucrative fees by making mortgage loans to federally backed housing programs. But <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> assumes most of the losses if a project defaults. The program is designed to encourage the preservation and rehabilitation of moderately priced housing. <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> has approved a four-month moratorium on new participants for the program, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said, after a recent review by the <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> inspector general found mismanagement and alleged fraud in the program. Almost $ 700 million worth of mortgages are in default, it said. Three lenders were thrown out of the program in March and six others were put on six-month probation, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said.

<TEXT>
 A Soviet submarine was on fire off <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s northern coast early Monday, spewing thick smoke but sailing east at half-speed toward the the Soviet naval base at <LOCATION> Murmansk </LOCATION>, Norwegian officials said The Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> initially reported that the vessel was sending distress signals. But Norwegian officials said later that crewmen on deck waved away Norwegian rescue helicopter and appeared `` relatively relaxed.'' It was not immediately known if the vessel was nuclear-powered or carrying nuclear weapons. `` A Norwegian F-16 fighter ... reported a submarine of unknown type that was billowing heavy smoke 110 kilometers -LRB- 70 miles -RRB- northwest of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> in -LRB- the province of -RRB- <LOCATION> Finnmark </LOCATION>,'' Defense Minister <PERSON> Johan </PERSON> <PERSON> Joergen </PERSON> <PERSON> Holst </PERSON> said on state radio. He said alerted to the fire at 3:30 a.m. -LRB- 1:30 a.m. EDT -RRB-. <PERSON> Holst </PERSON> said the submarine was probably carrying nuclear weapons. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, in its initial report on the fire, did not say what type of submarine was involved. It said a Soviet reconnaisance plane had been dispatched. <PERSON> Gunnar </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Angletweit </PERSON>, a Norwegian <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said later that the submarine was sailing east at half-speed toward the Soviet Northern Fleet Base at <LOCATION> Murmansk </LOCATION>. A Norwegian rescue helicopter dispatched to the area spotted several crewmen on deck, but they waved the Sea King helicopter away, said <PERSON> Terje </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lien </PERSON>, an official of the <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coordination </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Bodoe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>. He said that the helicopter's crew had apparently mistaken for an emergency flare a signal that the submarine did not want help.

Col. <PERSON> Gullow </PERSON> <PERSON> Gjeseth </PERSON>, Norwegian <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said the Soviets appeared to have the situation under control with rescue efforts from <LOCATION> Murmansk </LOCATION>. `` The crew who were on deck were reported to be relatively relaxed,'' he told <ORGANIZATION> NRK </ORGANIZATION>, the state broadcasting company. <PERSON> Gjeseth </PERSON> said earlier that the Norwegians had dispatched coast guard vessels, some equipped to test for radiation. `` We must reckon on there being nuclear weapons on board,'' said the defense spokesman, adding that it is impossible to tell what armaments are being carried from surveillance photographs.

<HEAD>General Accused Of Drug Trafficking Also Blamed for Ivory, Diamond

 The defense minister has told a military tribunal that a highly decorated general accused of trafficking in cocaine also smuggled ivory and diamonds and should receive a punishment that sets an example. The 47-member tribunal was to hold a second closed-door session today to consider the case against Gen. <PERSON> Arnaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON>, who is alleged to have been involved with <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> drug cartel for three years. The tribunal of top-ranking officers is to decide if the general is to be stripped of his rank and ordered to stand trial on the charges. With his voice at times rising in anger, Gen. <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> told the tribunal on Sunday that <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON>'s actions `` represent an outrage, a stab in the back to the fatherland and a slap in the face.'' He said <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> should receive `` punishment that sets an example'' because he was such a highly regarded officer. Gen. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> is the brother of Cuban President <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON>, 57, is one of only five officers who hold the medal of the Hero of the Republic of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. A veteran of the Cuban revolution, he was decorated for his service as a field commander of Cuban troops in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. Gen. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>'s allegation about ivory and diamond smuggling represented a new dimension in the biggest scandal to rock <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> power circles in 30 years of Communist rule. Authorities say <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> was the ringleader of officers who let cocaine smugglers use <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> military air bases and arranged escorts for drug-carrying boats. The defense minister's speech was broadcast on on state-run television during the evening newscast, which devoded 40 minute to the hearing. A newscaster said eight witnesses, all military officers, also testified. Gen. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> said fellow officers had disapproved as early as 1970 of <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON>'s joking manner and frequent bragging about business deals. They suspected corruption, but it was not proven until later, he said. `` Only he could explain, if he has been able to explain it to himself, how this process occurred in which his highest aspiration becomes transforming himself into a typical capitalist businessman,'' Gen. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> said. He also accused <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> of demoralizing officers in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> by saying, `` They have sent me to a lost war so that they can hang the defeat on me.'' The Cuban troops were sent to <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> to back a Marxist government in its fight against a rebel insurgency. A cease-fire in the conflict took effect over the weekend. <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> sat with his head bowed and a tense look on his face during Gen. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>'s speech. After <PERSON> Ocho </PERSON>'s arrest June 12, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> reported that 10 other military officers and government officials were accused of accepting bribes from drug traffickers. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> prosecutors say the names of some of the Cuban officers had surfaced in a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investigation of a smuggling ring that culminated in two indictments and a 1988 trial. On Saturday, the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> military announced that it would shoot down private planes that violate Cuban airspace and refuse orders to land for inspection. The announcement said <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> intended to stop drug-smuggling planes from using its airspace. The official <ORGANIZATION> Granma </ORGANIZATION> newspaper has said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allegations about <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> being a way station for cocaine traffickers prompted <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> to order the investigation that led to the arrest of <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> and the other officers. A <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official, asked about reports that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials want to talk to <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON>, did not rule out the possibility. `` These things are from top level to top level,'' the Ministry official said. `` This sort of thing has been done before.''

<HEAD>Survivor of Auschwitz Slain Over Swastika</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 An <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> survivor was beaten and stabbed to death after confronting a man he had accused of scrawling a swastika on his door, police said. <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Kowalski </PERSON>, 72, was found dead Saturday in the second-floor apartment of <PERSON> Ruben </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> <PERSON> Zucarino </PERSON>, 36, who was charged with second-degree murder, said police spokesman Sgt. <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>. An arraignment was scheduled for today. A popular man known as `` the mayor of <LOCATION> Brighton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Kowalski </PERSON> spent his days in a rented room at the <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> boarding house tinkering with old televisions and radios and talking with friends about his native <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. `` This is n't the way God wanted it,'' said <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Solsky </PERSON>, a 72-year-old neighbor. `` He was a friend in a Jewish neighborhood who should never have died with a swastika or violently.'' <PERSON> Kowalski </PERSON>, a Jew whose family perished at <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION>, came to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1949 and worked as a carpenter. He survived the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> death camp and his wife also is a Holocaust survivor. `` She figures that he survived everything else, and then for this to happen,'' said <PERSON> Kowalski </PERSON>'s 38-year-old son, <PERSON> Lenny </PERSON>. `` The guy might have stabbed him, but the war still killed him,'' the son said. `` It was the insignia that did it. If it had n't been there, this never would have happened.'' The younger <PERSON> Kowalski </PERSON> said he was visiting with his father Saturday morning in the workshop when he noticed the swastika and a skull and crossbones scrawled in blue felt-tip pen on the door. His father quietly washed the marks from the door, the younger <PERSON> Kowalski </PERSON> said. The son complained to the landlady, <PERSON> Tuey </PERSON> <PERSON> Chin </PERSON>, who said that when she asked <PERSON> Zucarino </PERSON> about the graffiti he was holding a marker of the same blue color in his hands. But he told her he knew nothing about the drawings. A short time later, the elder <PERSON> Kowalski </PERSON> went to <PERSON> Zucarino </PERSON>'s apartment, where he confronted him about the swastika and grabbed him by the throat, police said A fight ensued. Zucarino stabbed <PERSON> Kowalski </PERSON> repeatedly with a scissors and a fork and smashed a religious statue over his head, killing him, police said. Ms. <PERSON> Chin </PERSON> said <PERSON> Zucarino </PERSON> may have attacked <PERSON> Kowalski </PERSON> with a 5-inch-high metal Statue of Liberty. She said he showed her the statue after the attack. `` I'm not sure if he hit <PERSON> Max </PERSON> over the head later with the Statue of Liberty or a religious statue,'' she said. `` But there was a Statue of Liberty all right. Brass, bronze, whatever.''

 Advocates for AIDS patients hailed a proposal by the chief of federal AIDS research to allow for greater distribution of experimental drugs. Dr. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Fauci </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Allergy </ORGANIZATION> and Infectious Diseases, recommended the development of `` parallel track'' testing under which patients would have access to promising drugs as soon as they are proved safe, even while tests for effectiveness were under way. `` It's a great step forward,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Mathilde </PERSON> <PERSON> Krim </PERSON>, a founder of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> for AIDS Research. `` It represents a new consensus on how to handle drug development for AIDS and life-threatening diseases in general.'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Delaney </PERSON>, co-director of Project Inform, a group of AIDS activists, said he planned to ask a committee of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> today to endorse <PERSON> Fauci </PERSON>'s idea. In a speech Friday, <PERSON> Fauci </PERSON> called for the `` compassionate distribution'' of trial drugs to ineligible applicants. `` It's clear to me that we can not just rely on the traditional approach of clinical trials,'' <PERSON> Fauci </PERSON> said during a talk at the HIV Treatment Awareness Week conference. HIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus, which causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Clinical trials are designed to test the effectiveness of drugs that have been proved non-toxic. Test subjects must meet strict requirements that typically exclude many applicants. `` We've got to rethink the rigidity with which we exclude people,'' he said. <PERSON> Fauci </PERSON> said drug companies, the <ORGANIZATION> federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, and AIDS patients must consider the possibility of parallel track testing. `` It's not something that any one person or organization has the ability to make happen because you're involving the public and private factions,'' he said. `` The critical thing is this ca n't happen by fiat It's a concept.'' <PERSON> Fauci </PERSON>, a staunch advocate of clinical trials as the only means to discover definitive scientific answers, emphasized the continued need for rigorous studies. Part of the need for parallel tracking stems from the limited availability of drugs to treat AIDS, <PERSON> Fauci </PERSON> said. Similarly, the drug trial process is slow and limited and leaves out many patients who are eager to try experimental drugs.

<TEXT>
 The mother of Siamese twins who just celebrated their fifth birthday says there is no tragedy in her two girls being joined together. <PERSON> Marlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Cady </PERSON> wrote in this week's People magazine that when a stranger walks up to <PERSON> Verena </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ruthie </PERSON> and laments the youngsters' fate, `` I always tell those people that the only tragedy is in their interpretation of the girls' situation, because obviously <PERSON> Ruthie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Verena </PERSON> are happy kids. The girls, born April 13, 1984, are joined from the collarbone to the waist and share a heart, liver and parts of the intestines. Sharing a heart makes the girls tire easily and they are more susceptible to infection than most children. Mrs. <PERSON> Cady </PERSON>, whose family lives near <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>, said that when the girls had pneumonia at age 9 months, she and her husband, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON>, found themselves talking about their lives as `` now or after the girls die.'' `` But when we celebrated their first birthday, we realized that we could wait for things to change until we were 105 years old, but then we would have spent the time waiting instead of living,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Cady </PERSON> wrote. She said the children have distinct personalities _ <PERSON> Ruthie </PERSON> is stubborn while <PERSON> Verena </PERSON> likes to make sure she's doing the right thing. The girls have mastered feats that doctors thought impossible. When they perfected riding a special tricycle, `` they rode up and down the street for three days, knocking on doors and ringing bells to make sure everyone knew about their new treasure.'' The twins' older sister, <PERSON> Maria </PERSON>, had been upset at all the attention the twins got but then realized they are special, their mother said. `` Sometimes I feel sorry for my sisters being attached because they do n't always want to do the same thing. But when they are n't arguing, I think they're very lucky to be together,'' <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> said Conjoined twins occur about once in 100,000 births. About half die within 48 hours of birth. Mrs. <PERSON> Cady </PERSON> said that when she thinks `` about how long they might live, it's in terms of a couple of years. We live for the present.''

 Federal inspectors told three <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> nuclear plant officials to shut down the reactor before the directive was obeyed, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Noel </PERSON> <PERSON> Dudley </PERSON>, senior <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> inspector at the plant, denied that agency officials had to grab anyone to get a response, as alleged by a <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> critic. Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, D-Mass., said Friday <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lando </PERSON> <PERSON> Zech </PERSON> and other commission officials told him an <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> inspector grabbed a plant operator before Thursday's unplanned shutdown The <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sunday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> reported details of the shutdown based on interviews with <PERSON> Dudley </PERSON>, plant officials and others. The shutdown, on the 10th day of low-power tests at the $ 6 billion plant, prompted the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> to suspend further tests pending a review. <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> said he will ask an <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> appeal board to stop the tests until safety issues for full-power operation are reviewed. `` The <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> pointed to those same problems a year ago after a mock evacuation exercise,'' <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> said. Plant spokesmen said neither the plant nor the public was endangered. But <PERSON> Markey </PERSON> said the results could have been much worse at higher power. `` It's very frightening to think what would have happened if this plant had been operating at 70 to 80 percent of full power and there had been no <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> people in the control room,'' he said. Thursday's events, plant officials say, began when a malfunctioning valve on the non-nuclear side of the operation produced changes in readouts from a part called a pressurizer on the nuclear side. The change was sufficient to warrant a shutdown, spokesman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Sher </PERSON> said Sunday. One <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> inspector and then <PERSON> Dudley </PERSON> approached three plant officials pointing out the problem, but got no immediate results, the <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> said. Minutes later, an operator did shut down the plant. `` They were making a conscious decision to attempt to regain pressure control'' even though plant procedures called for a shutdown, <PERSON> Dudley </PERSON> said. An unidentified <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> inspector first approached <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON>'s startup manager about the pressure reading, the <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> said. When the manager did not respond, the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> inspector approached the test director, who was closer to the scene in the control room, and the director agreed the plant should be shut, the paper said. But according to the newspaper, the test director then talked to the shift supervisor, a higher-ranking official, who said that pressure problem was being corrected on its own and there was no need to turn off the plant. <PERSON> Dudley </PERSON> stepped in at that point, approaching a still higher <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> official, the assistant operators manager, said <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Horwitz </PERSON>. The assistant manager consulted the operations manager, who acknowledged the information and deferred to the decision of the shift supervisor to continue to operate, <PERSON> Horwitz </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>'s congressional delegation and governor unanimously agreed on a plan that protects some of the nation's oldest trees and a rare breed of owl Logging officials and environmentalists have until Tuesday to decide whether to back the plan, which also permits logging old-growth forests. Representatives of the timber industry and environmental groups, brought together by the politicians, met during the weekend for the first time outside courtrooms in the five-year dispute that has restricted logging of ancient coastal evergreens. If the proposal is accepted, it would for the first time allow legislative protection of the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION>'s most significant stands of old-growth forest, which range from 200 to 1,000 years old. Environmentalists have obtained injunctions on behalf of the rare northern spotted owl. The injunctions have prevented logging in federal lands that are usually open for loggers in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>. There are fewer than 6,000 of the owls, which can survive only in old-growth forest. Conservationists say continued logging is leading to the bird's extinction. The chairman of the weekend meeting, Sen. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON>, R-Ore., called on environmentalists and the industry to respond to the plan by noon Tuesday He set the deadline because on Wednesday the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> plans to take up financing for the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> for fiscal year 1990. Environmentalists said they were n't sure they could meet the deadline. `` There are a lot of things undefined,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Giesen </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and one of three environmental panelists at the summit. `` We're discussing it and we have a lot of people to talk to.'' He added that Tuesday's deadline will be `` very, very difficult'' to meet. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Albrecht </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, said the proposal would be accepted only `` with great difficulty.'' But he said: `` I would be in favor of it because it's a short-term solution. I do n't see any threat in it.'' Gov. <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldschmidt </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>'s two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senators and five congressmen backed the proposal, which calls for a short-term boost in the timber supply if environmentalists agree to concessions on lawsuits over the northern spotted owl. The proposal, unveiled during Saturday's meeting, would guarantee for the industry 8 billion board feet of timber from national forests in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and 1 billion board feet from <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> forests during the next year and three months. In return, environmentalists would get legislation preserving `` significant'' old growth stands and a commitment to adopt forest planning processes that minimize fragmentation of remaining stands. No specifics were available on the amount of old-growth forest left intact. The agreement would be less than what federal officials had allowed before environmentalist won the no-cut injunctions. <PERSON> Goldschmidt </PERSON> said he was surprised an agreement was reached among the elected officials. `` I believe this does provide us with some hope for stability in the timber area,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, R-Ore. `` For the first time in a long time we wo n't have judges and lawyers managing <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>'s resources,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyden </PERSON>, D-Ore Timber industry representatives were pleased with the movement in the issue. `` I think what the delegation has done here is unprecedented,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON>, a timber company owner representing the industry at the summit. `` I personally find the recommendation difficult to accept.'' But he said, `` Thinking of the 90,000 people who work in the timber industry, I have to give it serious consideration.'' <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON> said the agreement still meant some jobs would be lost under the proposal. The wood products industry, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>'s largest industry, has estimated that 20,000 jobs could be lost in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> by 1991 if court injunctions restricting timber supply remained in force.

 Potential jurors in the federal trial of billionaire <PERSON> Leona </PERSON> <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>'s tax evasion case must reveal their income, what they think about rich people and whether they believe the hotel queen is an ogre. Jury selection was to begin today in the trial of the 69-year-old Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> and two former aides. She and her husband, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON>, are accused of evading federal taxes by billing personal luxuries, including a marble dance floor for their mansion, as business expenses. Her 80-year-old husband has been found incompetent to stand trial because of loss of memory. The <ORGANIZATION> Helmsleys </ORGANIZATION> head a $ 5 billion real estate and hotel empire, mostly in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> area. In April 1988, the <ORGANIZATION> Helmsleys </ORGANIZATION> were indicted on charges they evaded personal income taxes by disguising about $ 4 million in renovations to their <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, mansion as a business expense. Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> is portrayed in advertisements as the `` Queen of the Helmsley Hotels.'' The ad campaign calls <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> <PERSON> Palace </PERSON> `` the only palace in the world where the queen stands guard.'' <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Brodsky </PERSON>, lawyer for <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Turco </PERSON>, planned to hand potential jurors a questionnaire asking their incomes and attitude toward the wealthy. He said he wants to know if the potential jurors are `` biased against rich people ... or whether they've seen Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>'s ads in the newspapers and they think she's an ogre.'' <PERSON> Turco </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Licari </PERSON> are charged with helping create bogus invoices to make it appear that the costly renovations on the $ 8 million, 28-room mansion were tax-deductible improvements on business properties. Among the renovations listed in the 47-count indictment were a marble dance floor installed above a swimming pool; a breakfast room; an indoor-outdoor stereo system; more than $ 370,000 in landscaping; and an assortment of furniture and paintings. The indictment said a $ 45,000 silver clock in the shape of the Helmsley Building _ a gift for <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> _ was billed to and paid by the Park Lane Hotel. Four jade art objects worth half a million dollars were paid for by four hotels as furniture purchases, the indictment said. Last fall, the <ORGANIZATION> Helmsleys </ORGANIZATION>' lawyer, <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Feffer </PERSON>, said the false invoices were a device used by <PERSON> Turco </PERSON> and <PERSON> Licari </PERSON> `` to enable them to steal blindly from the <ORGANIZATION> Helmsleys </ORGANIZATION>. That's crucial to our defense.'' The case was going to court after a lengthy pretrial period during which defense lawyers filed many motions to overturn the indictment or to remove one or both of the Helmsleys from the case. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in April rejected a motion to dismiss the indictment. The motion said prosecutors engaged in misconduct because of grand jury leaks to the news media. Earlier this month, a federal judge found <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> unable to assist in his defense because of memory lapses and reasoning difficulties. The ruling did not dismiss the charges against <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> but indefinitely delayed his trial. The judge noted that doctors believed <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>'s mental deterioration, cause by several mild strokes, would continue and that it was unlikely he would be tried.

<HEAD>U.S., Soviets Approach Accords on Nuclear Blasts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet negotiators today opened a new round of talks on monitoring underground nuclear tests with both sides saying they are close to reaching agreements. They are drafting new monitoring provisions for two 1970s superpower treaties limiting the power of military and other nuclear explosions to 150 kilotons. One kiloton has the force of 1,000 tons of <ORGANIZATION> TNT </ORGANIZATION>, and the bomb dropped on <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, in 1945, carried an explosive force of 20 kilotons. The aim of the talks is to gain <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> ratification of the two accords. The original treaties never entered into force because the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> refused approval over concerns the limits could not be enforced. Talks resumed after a six-month recess partly due to the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's review of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms control and security policy. The new discussions began at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mission in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> with a meeting of the two delegation chiefs, <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and Soviet <PERSON> Igor </PERSON> <PERSON> Palenykh </PERSON>. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> has said the new talks, due to last five to six weeks, will aim to complete agreements. <PERSON> Palenykh </PERSON> said there is `` a good basis for reaching practical results within a short time.'' The officials said a verification plan for the 1976 Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty is virtually complete, but some work remains on amendments to prevent cheating on the 1974 Threshold Test Ban Treaty on nuclear weapons tests. Both sides are to be allowed various methods to measure nuclear blasts, including on-site checks at each other's nuclear testing grounds. In the future, the negotiations are intended to produce further superpower agreements limiting and, ultimately, banning nuclear tests. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has long urged <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to join in a mutual ban on testing. However, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> says tests will be needed as long as its military strategy includes reliance on nuclear weapons. The nuclear testing talks are separate from U.S.-Soviet negotiations on reducing long-range nuclear arsenals that resumed in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> last week.

 Lesbian motorcyclists whose attire ranged from nothing to black-lace stockings and leather corsets led up to 300,000 marchers marking the 20th anniversary of the gay-rights movement. Demonstrations were held throughout the nation to commemorate the June 27, 1969, riot at the Stonewall Inn in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, where gay bar patrons fought back during a routine police raid. The rebellion sparked three days of rioting and gave birth to the gay rights movement. More than half a million people marched Sunday in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lansing </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` Ten or 15 years ago, I do n't think anyone would have guessed that we would have come so far,'' said activist <PERSON> Joanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Trapani </PERSON>, as <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> became the city's first mayor while in office to ride in the Gay and Lesbian Pride Parade. In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, a cheering crowd estimated by organizers at 300,000 people and by police at 140,000 turned out for the 19th annual Lesbian-Gay Freedom Parade. The parade was led by `` Dykes on Bikes,'' a scantily-clad women's motorcycle contingent AIDS groups were well represented at the parade, and the crowd expressed its appreciation as each contingent passed by. `` I get such a warm, loving feeling from everybody on the sidelines,'' said AIDS patient <PERSON> Wes </PERSON> <PERSON> Luttrell </PERSON>, 43, who traveled 450 miles from <LOCATION> Roseburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, to participate. `` It's so uplifting.'' The parade wound through <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s predominantly gay <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> <PERSON> District </PERSON> to the Civic Center for a rally and entertainment. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, 150,000 people marched in the annual Lesbian and Gay Pride March. `` It's a generation of lesbians and gays coming together,'' said City Councilwoman <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Messinger </PERSON>. `` We've made a lot of progress, but it's never enough.'' The festivities were stopped briefly for a moment of silence for AIDS victims. As marchers stood quietly, skywriting planes spelled out `` We remember'' over <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. `` I have to be here for all those who are n't,'' said marcher <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Polito </PERSON>. `` This is n't an issue of being gay any more. This is an issue of human rights.'' An anti-gay group of about three dozen people heckled marchers from behind a police barricade, waving signs and shouting, `` Perverts on parade!'' On Saturday night, about 400 activists tried to force their way into the Sixth Precinct, whose officers were involved in the riot. There were no injuries and no arrests, said police spokesman Sgt. <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, more than 200,000 people gathered for the annual Gay and Lesbian Pride Celebration. The parade began with the release of thousands of pink balloons inscribed with the words `` I Love You'' as a tribute to AIDS patients. `` We're here because it's the one time of the year that we can really be ourselves,'' said <PERSON> Gino </PERSON> <PERSON> Pascalaiti </PERSON>, 30, of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION>. `` It means _ happiness.'' About 90,000 people from across the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> attended <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s parade, organizers said `` I think the parade means a lot to the gay and lesbian community and it means a lot to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> said. `` It shows a community spirit.'' An estimated 5,000 to 10,000 people turned out in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> for a parade and rally. In <LOCATION> Lansing </LOCATION>, about 2,500 people rallied on the steps of the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION>. `` I've been a practicing lesbian for about 60 years, and I'm glad to feel free to walk down the street today,'' said <PERSON> Porty </PERSON> <PERSON> Portwood </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Okemos </LOCATION>. About 200 people attended a rally in <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, on Saturday about 300 people took part in the city's third-annual gay and lesbian March for Justice. At a rally following the parade, activists called for protection against discrimination in housing, employment and public accommodation, increased AIDS spending and the right to be open about their relationships.

<HEAD>Army Sweeps Mining Area to Crush Revolt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KIETA, Papua New Guinea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Government forces burned homes and rounded up villagers in an operation aimed at crushing a secessionist revolt that has closed a giant copper mine, news reports said today. The rebels were reported overnight to have destroyed a power plant at a farm run by <ORGANIZATION> Bougainville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Copper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, which owns the economically crucial mine on northern <LOCATION> Bougainville </LOCATION> island. A state of emergency went into effect today, Australian <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> said. It gives authorities broad powers to search, seize and arrest, and it allows them to evacuate people from emergency areas. Witnesses reported houses ablaze and said at least two dozen people were taken away by police, the news agency said. Soldiers blocked the access road to the mine and checked all vehicles, it said. Many residents were likely to be forcibly evacuated from rebel-held areas to isolate secessionist leader <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Ona </PERSON>, a 35-year-old surveyor, and his <ORGANIZATION> Bougainville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, the agency said. The unrest, which broke out seven months ago, closed the mine May 15. Rebel landowners say it is damaging the environment and they demand $ 10 billion in compensation. The security forces commander, Col. <PERSON> Lima </PERSON> <PERSON> Dotaona </PERSON>, has called on <ORGANIZATION> Ona </ORGANIZATION> to surrender. He said Sunday before launching the operation he was confident his men would restore order, but he said he expected a protracted operation. `` It's a dangerous operation, and you can expect casualties,'' he said. In an address broadcast to the nation Friday, Prime Minister <PERSON> Rabbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Namaliu </PERSON> said the government could not allow a `` criminal minority'' to threaten the unity and economic stability of the nation. The mine had been contributing 20 percent of <LOCATION> Papua </LOCATION> <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION>'s total revenue through royalties and taxes The rebels have spurned all attempts at conciliation, ambushing mine workers and soldiers. Three soldiers have died and about 20 other members of the security forces and numerous civilians have been wounded. Tensions boiled over because local landowners objected to profits being made from the island's mine, which ranks among the world's 10 biggest open-cut copper mines. The rebels demand a referendum on secession. <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s biggest mining company, <ORGANIZATION> CRA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, jointly operates the mine, which is about 300 miles northeast of the mainland. <LOCATION> Papua </LOCATION> <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION>, with a 3.5 million population, gained independence from <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> in 1975.

Naval Academy entry. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s teardrop-shaped sub was awarded $ 5,000 in the first-ever, human-powered submarine races, based on a combination of speed, innovation and cost-effectiveness. `` We're having a used-sub sale tomorrow,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Poole </PERSON>, champagne bottle in hand. Awards were presented after a second day of stormy weather forced cancellation of a nine-sub race around a 1-kilometer loop course. The Subversion, the entry from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Polytechnic </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Luis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Obispo </LOCATION>, won the speed award, beating the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s sub by eight seconds in a 100-yard time trial Saturday. All the subs were `` wet'' designs that fill up with water and require racers to wear scuba gear. Those propelling the subs said the biggest challenge was to maintain a steady pace and not breathe too quickly, which can lead to light-headedness or blackout.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has ordered an investigation into the death of a second sailor in little more than a year at a training pool. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fedie </PERSON>, a 22-year-old flight officer candidate from <LOCATION> Altoona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, died Friday after a drill at the <ORGANIZATION> Pensacola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION> in which he jumped off a tower and swam a short distance under water, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said. `` He had completed an abandon-ship drill and was walking out of the pool when he collapsed,'' said Chief Warrant Officer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON>. A preliminary autopsy indicated <PERSON> Fedie </PERSON> died from acute cerebral edema, said <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Esty </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman. Edema is an abnormal accumulation of fluid; its causes include a blow to the head, a tumor and deprivation of oxygen. Final autopsy results will not be available for several weeks, she said. Chief Warrant Officer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> said an investigation has been ordered. `` He was one of the best physical specimens you've ever seen,'' said <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, a high school friend. `` He called last Sunday to say that the class had started out with 65 guys and over half quit.

<TEXT>
 Authorities proclaimed today that all of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> backed the ouster of top <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> moderates, and suggested the purge of party members who sympathized with the pro-democracy movement could expand. The tightly controlled media stepped up a propaganda blitz encouraging support for the ruling Communists' decision to relieve party head <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON> of all his party posts for `` supporting the turmoils and splitting the party.'' A senior military official today reiterated previous government claims that there was `` no bloodshed'' on Tiananmen Square when tanks and troops cleared it of pro-democracy demonstrators on June 3-4. `` The whole process was nonviolent. No one used guns,'' said <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhiyun </PERSON>, one of the commanders of the assault, during a tour of the square to foreign reporters. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> acknowledged some innocent people `` may have been wounded'' as troops battled to reach the square, but said people had been warned not to go out on the streets that night. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said he had `` no regrets'' about the street battles to reach the The government said nearly 300 people died in the street battles in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, about half of them soldiers. Chinese witnesses and Western intelligence sources said the death toll may have been as high as 3,000. The leadership shake-up, announced Saturday, replaced the 69-year-old <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> with <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> party secretary <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Zemin </PERSON>, 62, a proponent of economic reforms who supports the current hard line that dissent must be dealt with harshly. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> is believed to have been stripped of power last month for refusing to endorse plans by Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> and senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> to declare martial law in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and have the army clear central Tiananmen Square. The party's <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday also announced the dismissal from the <ORGANIZATION> Standing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> of the ruling Politburo of <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Qili </PERSON>, another moderate said to have opposed the military crackdown, and several <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> supporters in top party positions. There were also suggestions the purge would be extended to lower levels of the party and government. The party's <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Discipline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inspection </ORGANIZATION>, in a report appearing in <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> dailies today, said party members `` who deviated from the correct political stand and violated party's disciplines during the turmoils and the counterrevolutionary rebellion should be strictly punished ... including expelling them from the party. It added that `` those party organizations which had made resistance against the decisions made by the party's <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> or had been controlled or manipulated by bad people during the turmoils and counterrevolutionary rebellion should be firmly overhauled and strictly dealt with.'' `` Turmoils'' alludes to the seven weeks of student-led pro-democracy demonstrations that were joined by hundreds of thousands of people including journalists, workers, professionals, party members and government workers. `` Counterrevolutionary rebellion'' is the government's term for popular resistance to the introduction of troops in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and for the nationwide unrest that followed the military assault on the capital. The official media, which in the first weeks following the assault reported about 1,800 arrests nationwide and paraded handcuffed detainees before television screens every night, has recently stopped publicizing detentions. It was not clear whether the government was responding to the international statements of protest and outrage over the harsh suppression of dissent, which has included the execution of 27 people. Chinese sources said students, teachers and others who joined the pro-democracy demonstrations were still being picked up by police, although some were being released after questioning. National television and radio and the official press were filled with statements from party officials, soldiers, intellectuals, farmers and workers, all solidly backing the party's hard-line stance toward those who failed to stand up against the `` party's enemies. The carefully orchestrated propaganda campaign showed a people dramatically changed from a month ago, when both blue - and white-collar workers showed strong support for the students and their demands that the party allow greater freedom and end corruption

 An `` underground railroad'' to help dissidents flee <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has brought a key student leader and two prominent intellectuals to safety, sources said today. Wu'er <PERSON> Kaixi </PERSON>, 21, the <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Normal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> student who was at the forefront of the crushed pro-democracy movement in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, fled safely even though Communist authorities issued a bulletin for his arrest, a local student activist said. The activist, who spoke on condition of anonymity, refused to divulge details of Wu'er's reported escape, saying he did not want to jeopardize future efforts to bring dissidents from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. A diplomatic source said he believed <PERSON> Wu'er </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaixi </PERSON> had fled the country. `` If I had $ 100 I'd put it down'' on the student's succesful escape, he said, adding that it was not `` 100 percent'' certain Wu'er is on the wanted list of 21 students sought by Communist Chinese authorities for leading pro-democracy protests, which the government has labeled a `` counterrevolutionary rebellion.'' Wu'er, a member of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s Turkish minority, is from northwest <LOCATION> Xinjiang </LOCATION> province. His compelling speeches and a television appearance with Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> during the movement made him famous throughout <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. In the television appearance, Wu'er interrupted the premier several times, told him to `` stop beating around the bush'' and respond to student demands for sweeping political change. Two other dissidents, intellectuals <PERSON> Yan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jiaqi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wan </PERSON> <PERSON> Runnan </PERSON>, were smuggled to the West through <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> by the underground railroad, the diplomatic source said. They are among seven intellectuals on another wanted list issued by <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> authorities as part of the crackdown on the pro-democracy movement. <PERSON> Yan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jiaqi </PERSON> is reported to be in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> after fleeing to <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> last week. <PERSON> Wan </PERSON> <PERSON> Runnan </PERSON> also came through <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and eventually will travel to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the diplomatic source said. <PERSON> Yan </PERSON> was a leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intellectuals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which played an important role in the movement for freedom and was banned by the Chinese government when martial law was declared May 20. Wan, general manager of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s first private high-technology company, the <ORGANIZATION> Stone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, had called for a meeting of the national congress to discuss the demands put forth by students who were demonstrating for a freer and less corrupt society. `` During the student movement, <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> and the students kept close relations,'' the independent Ming Pao newspaper in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> reported. The diplomatic source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said `` a lot of dissidents -LRB- and -RRB- opposition people have gone out'' through the underground railroad operated by students and other activists in this territory on the southeastern coast of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. He said he did not know how many people have fled <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> through <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and refused to give details about how they were smuggled out of the country. Since June 3-4, when the Chinese army moved into <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> to crush the protest movement, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has arrested at least 1,800 people and 27 people have been executed. Many student leaders and dissidents fled underground to avoid detention. The Asia Television network in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> on Sunday broadcast what it said was a statement made by <PERSON> Yan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jiaqi </PERSON> in which he leveled a withering attack at <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>, Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Shangkun </PERSON>, who were behind the crackdown. `` <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s political situation today is in the midst of a white terror,'' according to a copy of the statement made available by the network. He accused the three leaders of `` using the inhuman policies of fascism to take all of those who support democracy, the real <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> people, and wipe out the whole lot.''

Users who pay and register get extra benefits: the printed manual, telephone support, <PERSON> Quicksoft </PERSON>'s newsletter and updates of the program. `` But then there are intangible benefits: You're doing the right thing, you're helping us out, keeping us in business,'' he said. And that leads to newer and better versions of PC-Write. `` I do n't worry about the people who do n't register. I worry about the people who do register,'' he said. `` I want to make sure they're happy. ... `` If they're happy and we're making a reasonable profit, that's good. It's good enough for Quicksoft, with about 30 employees, to expand its product base, too. On Tuesday, the company announced its new file-search and `` hypertext'' information-linking utility scheduled for late-summer shipping. <PERSON> Quicksoft </PERSON> also has published its first catalog of third-party software it selects and supports for use with PC-Write. <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON>, whose catch-phrase is `` making a living, not a killing,'' chose his profession at age 11. `` I read a Reader's Digest article, ` The Man Who Talked to Machines,''' he said `` I was one of the people that just knew, then, I would be a programmer.'' He found computers to work on with an Explorer Scout troop sponsored by <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, then at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION>. `` I got kind of discouraged because computers were so expensive. I could n't own one and I really wanted to own one, so I kind of got distracted and went off. I was living on an island in Puget Sound for a while,'' he said. The first personal computers appeared about the time he founded the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> in 1976. He went to work for The Retail Computer Store in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. In 1978, he was the 10th employee hired by <ORGANIZATION> Microsoft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the software company that created the IBM-standard personal computer operating systems. `` Sometime in'82, I found myself thinking, ` Gee, <ORGANIZATION> Microsoft </ORGANIZATION> is getting huge and I'm kind of getting lost here,''' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Microsoft </ORGANIZATION> had 300 employees then; it now has about 3,800 worldwide. He started writing a program for word processing. `` I thought I could do something people would really like and really felt right, but I did n't know if I could explain that. I could n't really run an ad saying, ` Buy my word processor: It feels good.'' He could, however, share his word processor using the electronic bulletin boards of computer hobbyists. That eliminated distribution and advertising expenses. The first version, 1.0, was introduced in August 1983, with 150 copies sent to the press and 150 to bulletin boards. A PC Magazine reviewer suggested changes. <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> made them. By February 1984, <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> had written version 1.3 and the reviewer liked it. `` That review pretty much started us out. It generated enough interest and revenue so that I could hire our first employee, uh, who I later married.'' <PERSON> Megan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dana </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON>, an artist, draws <PERSON> Quicksoft </PERSON>'s trademark `` office cat'' on the company's literature. PC-Write typically is rated as good as or better than other full-featured word processors costing five times more than its $ 89 registration fee. It's anybody's guess how many copies of PC-Write are out there. <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> says the best estimates come from magazine surveys, which typically estimate that 6 percent of their readers use PC-Write. `` I discount that down to maybe 4 percent, and that's somewhere between half a million and 1 million users. And that's real exciting,'' he said. `` Working from the other end, we know we have paid users of about 125,000, of which 45,000 are full, registered users and the other 80,000 are on group licenses _ corporations and universities,'' he said. He expects revenues this year to be between $ 2 million and $ 3 million. Sales declined to $ 1.7 million last year from $ 2 million in 1987. He blames the slump on himself, for putting off the decision to step down as chief programmer to take up exclusively the presidency of <LOCATION> Quicksoft </LOCATION>. A final thought from <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON>: `` Our business is based on people being honest and people are. That's why we're successful.''

<HEAD>Federal Government Assigns Value to Alaska Wildlife</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Top 3 grafs new to CORRECT that department has not yet set values
in Exxon Valdez spill; picks up at 4th graf, But environmentalists</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is coming under fire for assigning specific dollar values to birds, mammals and other animals killed in toxic spills as a means of toting up the damage to the environment. The department plans to use the same basic approach in setting the damage estimate for the disastrous oil spill that occurred March 24 spill when the tanker <PERSON> Exxon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> ran aground in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Prince </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> William </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sound </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported today. No dollar values have yet been set in that incident, but the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said that in past spills, the department has calculated that fur seals were worth $ 15 each, sea gulls $ 7.88 apiece and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> geese $ 35.74 each. Striped bass were valued at $ 1.84 per pound. But environmentalists argue that the rules do n't account for the long-term damage to the environment, the newspaper said. `` If things continue as planned, the accounting of the environmental damage caused by the Exxon Valdez tragedy would be a small measure of what actually occurred,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Torricelli </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION> `` A jury can better assess the enormity of that damage than by attempting to use an adding machine and a pile of reimbursement receipts.'' The figures were developed from a computer model which is supposed to reflect the market value of the wildlife, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported. Similar computer models are to be used to determine a market value for the wildlife killed in three weekend oil spills in the waters off the continental <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The bill for the <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> spill will eventually be sent to <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>, owner of the tanker that spilled 11 million gallons of crude oil. Thus far, the oil has washed up on 728 miles of beaches and the dead wildlife count stands at 25,700 migratory birds, 800 sea otters, 84 bald eagles, and 20 harbor seals, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said.

<HEAD>Thai Fishermen Arrested in Slaying of Vietnamese Refugees</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Police have arrested four Thai fishermen who admit to massacring 130 Vietnamese refugees with pistols, knives and hammers, a senior officer said today. A lone survivor of the attack, a young man, returned from a refugee camp in <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> to identify the four, said Lt. Col. <PERSON> Prakob </PERSON> <PERSON> Banjapong </PERSON>, deputy police superintendant in the southern coastal town of <LOCATION> Songkhla </LOCATION>. Charges against the four include murder, robbery, attempted murder and attempted rape in the April 16 attack. They face the death penalty or life imprisonment if convicted. In a telephone interview, <PERSON> Prakob </PERSON> said police on Thursday arrested two fishermen, aged 40 and 20, from one of the two boats involved in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> slayings. Police found nails on the boat in the area of the boat's name, indicating the fishermen had tried to cover up the name, he said. Those two suspects led police to two other men, aged 29 and 22, who were arrested Saturday, <PERSON> Prakob </PERSON> said. Nails also were found driven into their boat. He said the four admit they killed the Vietnamese with pistols, knives and hammers. Refugee relief officials said the pirates intercepted the Vietnamese vessel off the Malaysian coast. They looted the boat, locked up the refugees below and set the vessel on fire, the officials said. Some refugees managed to jump out, but were shot by the pirates. The 22-year-old man who survived was rescued by another Vietnamese boat, they said. Pirate attacks against Vietnamese boat people have become increasingly violent. According to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> High Commissioner for Refugees, pirates attacked 38 boats since April 30. They killed 11 Vietnamese and left 372 others missing, raped 116 and abducted 70. <PERSON> Prakob </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> police this year have arrested four other suspected pirates who await trial for robbery and rape. The threat of pirates, prison-like refugee camps and days at sea without food and water have not discouraged the exodus of Vietnamese. More than 1.5 million have fled their homeland since 1975. Nations overwhelmed by an unrelenting flow that has increased by up to 300 percent this year have become less hospitable. They say the boat people now are fleeing economic hardship, not political persecution, and are calling for forced repatriation. But, at an international conference in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> earlier this month, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> repeated that it will not accept those forced to return. The meeting ended inconclusively with a plan to screen new arrivals and encourage voluntary returns. If that did not work, alternatives would have to be examined, delegates said.

<HEAD>Leading Reformer Says He's Nominated For Presidency</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Reformer <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON> said the communist party's <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> has decided to nominate him to be <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s president, a government newspaper reported today. Pozgary, a Politburo member, was one of three well-known reformers promoted on Saturday to a newly created four-man presidium of the party. The Central Committee named economic reformer <PERSON> Redzoe </PERSON> <PERSON> Nyers </PERSON> party chairman. It said he, Pozgary and Premier <PERSON> Miklos </PERSON> <PERSON> Nemeth </PERSON> will run the party along with <PERSON> Karoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>, the party's general secretary. The creation of the presidium seriously undercuts the power of <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>, a centrist who has come under heavy criticism by reformers. The presidium is to lead the party on a provisional basis until a crucial party congress set for Oct. 7, when communists will choose who will lead the party as <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> prepares for its first free and competitive elections next year. The choice of a leader at the congress is considered crucial to the party's attempts to hold power when the elections are held. The reformers believe that only their more democratic policies can give the party hope of emerging as the strongest force in next year's elections. <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> nominated him for the new top state post pending approval of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, the daily <ORGANIZATION> Magyar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hirlap </ORGANIZATION> reported. The newspaper printed a transcript of an hourlong television talk show with the four presidium members on state television Sunday night. `` I have been greatly honored at the session when they agreed that when the office of president of the republic is created by Parliament I'll be the nominee,'' <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON> previously had been named a likely candidate to replace the current largely ceremonial post of `` president of the presidential council'' held by <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Straub </PERSON>. Parliament is scheduled to go into session on Tuesday, but its agenda was not made public. It was not known whether the issue would be discussed. Knowledgeable sources said the new office will be created in 1990, when legislative elections are due to be held. Under constitutional changes being considered, the office of state president would be vested with much greater powers than the present figurehead role.

<TEXT>
 A leading dissident accused of making an illegal trip to Communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> went on trial today, and supporters chanted anti-government slogans and battled with police. About 500 radical students brandishing metal pipes, clubs and rocks hurled hundreds of firebombs at riot police as the Rev. Moon Ik-hwan went on trial for making a trip to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to discuss unifying the nations. `` Release unification fighter Moon Ik-hwan!'' students yelled, `` Down with -LRB- President -RRB- <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo!'' Several hundred police with shields defended themselves by swinging captured metal pipes. Some students and police were injured, but numbers were unavailable on arrests or injuries. Students from at least four colleges took part in the clash, which occurred on a city street in front of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Sogang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. About 1,500 police guarded the courthouse where <PERSON> Moon </PERSON>'s trial opened. Police arrested 13 radical students, chanting anti-government slogans, who seized the rooftop of a nearby six-story building and erected a large banner saying `` immediately release patriotic unification fighter Moon.'' <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> was brought to the courthouse in prison garb under heavy security. His hands were tied with rope, but he smiled and waved at supporters. The trial opening was delayed when about 200 Moon supporters mounted a sit-in outside the courtroom demanding they be allowed to use courtroom seats occupied by 50 police officers. No arrests were reported. The judge asked some officers to leave so that more <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> supporters could be seated. Moon is charged with violation of the National Security Law for his nine-day trip to the north in March. He talked to North Korean leader <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Sung </PERSON> about national unification, a popular issue with student protesters in the capitalist south. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s anti-communist government forbids unsanctioned trips to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, its bitter enemy, and maintains that dialogue on unification must be carried out through government channels. If convicted, <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> could face the death penalty, although that is not considered likely. Also today, arrest warrants were issued for three radical students the government says have encouraged people to participate in the World Youth Festival, which is to be held in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> July 1-8. The government has banned participation. The students have been charged with violation of national security laws, prosecutors said. <PERSON> Moon </PERSON>, 71, and his traveling companion <PERSON> Yoo </PERSON> <PERSON> Won-ho </PERSON>, a 59-year-old businessman, were arrested April 13 when they returned to <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> after stops in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. They have been in jail since then. Defense lawyers argued that the prosecution should drop charges against <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Yoo </PERSON> on grounds the indictment is unconstitutional. Repeating his earlier statements, <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> told the court that he visited the north to seek reunification. The Korean peninsula was divided after World War II. In 1950, the north invaded the south and started the three-year Korean War.

 The state's decision to consider reopening the investigation into the 1964 slayings of three civil rights workers has raised hopes a cloud of collective guilt may be lifted from this small community. What <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>'s 8,000 residents need now, says the editor of a newspaper here, is a cathartic event such as a new trial to help them deal with the emotional fallout from the town's complicity in the attempted coverup of the June 21, 1964, slayings of <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaney </PERSON>, <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwerner </PERSON>. `` The people here did n't step forward and speak out against the murders 25 years ago. That's why we need to do it now,'' said <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Dearman </PERSON>, editor and publisher of the <LOCATION> Neshoba </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Democrat. Last week, Attorney General <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said he was considering reopening the investigation into the killings, which were dramatized in the movie `` Mississippi Burning.'' <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said he would examine the files before making a final decision. Nine Mississippians, including a deputy sheriff, eventually went to prison on federal charges for violating the victims' civil rights. However, the state never prosecuted the case, in which <PERSON> Chaney </PERSON>, <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Schwerner </PERSON> were arrested in <LOCATION> Neshoba </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> on a traffic charge and then turned over to a <ORGANIZATION> Ku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION> lynch mob that shot them and buried the bodies in an dam near <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. On Wednesday, during a memorial observance, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Molpus </PERSON> issued a public apology to the victims' families `` We deeply regret what happened here 25 years ago,'' he said. `` Every decent person in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Neshoba </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> feels that way.'' Wednesday's ceremony, also attended by Gov. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Mabus </PERSON>, marked the first time state officials had honored the victims. <PERSON> Schwerner </PERSON> and <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON>, white civil rights volunteers from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Chaney </PERSON> _ a black civil rights worker from nearby <LOCATION> Meridian </LOCATION> _ were killed while working on a voter registration drive. <PERSON> Dearman </PERSON>, editor of the weekly paper since 1966, said the observance and movie had helped weaken some of the barriers holding back the emotions of residents, including his own feelings. `` There's a lot of denial in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, people saying they were n't involved or responsible for what happened,'' he said. `` I used to feel that same way but I've come to believe in the concept of collective guilt. And I've come to the conclusion that everybody in a community has a responsiblity to stand up when they see something wrong happen.'' He added that an investigation and trial could provide the final step in the community's acceptance of its responsibility. `` A trial undoubtedly would dredge up a lot of pain and turmoil,'' he said. `` But while there have been many positive changes here, I do n't think we're ever going to be able to completely put the past behind us until we've dealt with the murders.'' <PERSON> Molpus </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> native, said he, too, would support reopening the investigation if <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> decides to go ahead. `` The attorney general took an oath to uphold the law, as I did,'' said <PERSON> Molpus </PERSON>, whose mother still lives in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. `` But I admit to having mixed emotions, it could tear up the community and turn us back toward a dark and diverse time in our history.'' <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> McClain </PERSON>, mayor of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, said he feared reopening the case would divide the community. However, <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaney </PERSON>, whose brother was slain, says he thinks it should be reopened. `` It would help bring attention to some of the things that never were dealt with 25 years ago, such as the Klan beatings at the <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zion </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Methodist </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Church </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> J.R. </PERSON> `` Bud'' Cole was severely beaten by hooded and robed Klansmen following a meeting at the church, which was burned the week before <PERSON> Chaney </PERSON>, <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Schwerner </PERSON> were killed. There also was no investigation into the burning of the church, which was later rebuilt and was part of last week's memorial observance. `` That's the way things were back then,'' <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said. `` A white man could do anything to a Negro and never be held accountable.'' But <PERSON> Dearman </PERSON> says much has changed in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, which now has an integrated police force and fire department. And a recent <ORGANIZATION> KKK </ORGANIZATION> rally in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> drew little support, he said. `` Only about a hundred people showed up, and most of them were there as observers,'' <PERSON> Dearman </PERSON> said. `` In fact, something happened I've never seen before _ white people were actually shouting at the Klan to go away and leave us alone.''

 Communist rebels attacked anti-Marxist villagers at a church in a remote village and killed at least 39 people, including women and children, officials said today. Two of the dead _ a <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> lay leader and his brother _ were beheaded during the incident, which occurred Sunday at a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION> chapel in <LOCATION> Rano </LOCATION>, on <LOCATION> Mindanao </LOCATION> island about 640 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. At least eight people were wounded, officials said. The military said the death toll could be higher because the rebels carted away their casualties. A survivor claimed two rebels were killed. A church official in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> said the 39 confirmed dead were congregation members. Lt. Col. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Maneja </PERSON>, deputy commander of <LOCATION> Davao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sur </LOCATION> province, said about 100 <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas entered the village looking for the leader of a group of local anti-communist vigilantes. <PERSON> Maneja </PERSON> said details were unclear, but apparently someone indicated that vigilante leader <PERSON> Ruben </PERSON> <PERSON> Ayap </PERSON> was inside the church and shooting broke out. <PERSON> Ayap </PERSON> was killed along with his two brothers, <PERSON> Abadi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Clemente </PERSON>. <PERSON> Abadi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ayap </PERSON>, head of the laymen's group at the church, and his brother <PERSON> Clemente </PERSON> were beheaded, the military said. <PERSON> Regina </PERSON> <PERSON> Dominguez </PERSON>, 41, whose daughter was killed in the shooting, said the rebels were angry because villagers had formed an anti-communist group. `` They took revenge,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Dominguez </PERSON> said by telephone from nearby Digos. `` They just fired.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Dominguez </PERSON> said she was not in the village when the shooting began but heard from survivors that villagers hacked to death at least one guerrilla with long `` bolo'' knives. Lt. Col. <PERSON> Cresencio </PERSON> <PERSON> Maralit </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constabulary </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, said the villagers had made the rebels angry by refusing to pay `` revolutionary taxes.'' <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Endar </PERSON>, 22, a vigilante who survived the attack, told reporters he and about 70 others were crowded into the bamboo-walled church when the rebels opened fire with M-16 rifles and two machine guns. He said vigilante members ran from the church to get their weapons and killed at least two guerrillas. `` I was hit when I ran out of the church to get my bolo,'' said <PERSON> Endar </PERSON>, who was wounded in the leg. `` I saw many people dead, and I pretended to be dead. As I ran from the church, I stepped on many bodies.'' <PERSON> Endar </PERSON> said he rode by horseback for two hours to alert a military garrison. He said 20 members of his vigilants group and 12 children were among the dead, including a one-year-old. In <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Briones </PERSON>, human rights coordinator for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION>, said the battle broke out after Sunday school as the congregation was preparing for services. He said it was unusual for rebels to attack his denomination's churches The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION> has been widely criticized by the military for alleged links with communist rebels because of the denomination's outspoken stand on human rights. Sunday's incident occurred in an area of southeastern <LOCATION> Mindanao </LOCATION> where the military has organized armed anti-communist vigilante groups to counter rebels in remote areas. Various church organizations have accused the vigilantes of widespread human rights abuses. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> has been waging a 20-year insurgency to establish a communist state in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>.

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Sousuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> promised political reforms to win back public trust today after his beleaguered party was badly beaten in an election seen as a barometer of voter sentiment. On Sunday, <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> candidate <PERSON> Kinuko </PERSON> <PERSON> Ofuchi </PERSON> won a by-election in northern <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> for a seat in parliament's upper house, defeating a candidate from the governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. A Socialist previously held the seat, but <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> told reporters today, `` I never expected that we would lose so badly'' in the traditionally conservative district of <LOCATION> Niigata </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> acknowledged a new 3 percent sales tax, a huge stock scandal and farm issues contributed to his <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s defeat. But he again refused to comment on the governing party's latest scandal: allegations that he paid a geisha to be his mistress for four months in 1985. `` I have respected political ethics for 30 years and I have not done anything unethical,'' he told a news conference. But he added: `` I think it is regrettable that I caused trouble.'' A weekly magazine had reported the geisha link, without naming the woman. After the polls closed Sunday night, a 40-year-old woman appeared in a national television interview, saying she was the former geisha and that Uno had paid more than $ 21,430 to her and her geisha house. <PERSON> Mitsuko </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakanishi </PERSON>'s allegations have sullied the reputation that led to <PERSON> Uno </PERSON>'s selection as prime minister just a month ago. His predecessor, <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, resigned to take responsibility for a scandal in which the giant information and publishing conglomerate, <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, is accused of trying to influence government policy with excessive donations and sales of bargain-priced, unlisted stock to public officials. Support for Uno's new Cabinet was at only 16.7 percent in a telephone survey of 10,000 people conducted June 16-19, the <ORGANIZATION> Nihon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Keizai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s leading financial newspaper, reported today. Although this was an improvement from the 13.1 percent rating for <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s Cabinet in March, 52.8 percent of those questioned in the latest poll said they do not support <PERSON> Uno </PERSON>'s government, <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> said. The remaining 30.5 percent did not respond. Both polls and by-elections are being watched closely ahead of next month's elections for parliament's upper house, where <PERSON> Uno </PERSON>'s party holds 143 of 251 seats Ms. <PERSON> Ofuchi </PERSON>, Sunday's election winner, campaigned against the sales tax that took effect April 1 along with income tax cuts, criticized <PERSON> Uno </PERSON>'s party fpr the scandal, and apparently won favor with rural voters displeased with a greater opening of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s farm market to imports. With 99.6 percent of the vote counted, Ms. <PERSON> Ofuchi </PERSON> had 559,603 votes to 482,245 votes for <PERSON> Hideo </PERSON> <PERSON> Kimi </PERSON> <PERSON> of </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON>'s party and 47,064 for <PERSON> Kazuo </PERSON> <PERSON> Murata </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> Communist Party. `` We intend to listen attentively to the people's voices,'' <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> said today. He said his party will work to restore public confidence by promoting political reforms. `` I understand that following the Watergate scandal, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> made various political reforms, including election reform and other tougher regulations to prevent recurrences of the same wrongdoings,'' Uno said.

 The condition of Premier <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> improved today as hospital treatment continued for heart and kidney problems, doctors said today. <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> met briefly today with <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON> and planned talks with the leader of a leftist alliance on forming a coalition government. <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>, 70, was admitted to <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday with pneumonia he contracted eight months after undergoing open heart surgery in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. Hospital officials said he subsequently experienced heart and kidney complications. In a medical bulletin today, a team of doctors said <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> `` spent a peaceful night. His treatment continues and his condition is improving.'' On Sunday, the hospital said the premier was in serious but stable condition after undergoing three hours of blood dialysis. Dr. <PERSON> Magdi </PERSON> <PERSON> Yacoub </PERSON>, who performed triple bypass heart surgery on the premier September 30, flew in from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> on Sunday with a team of heart specialists for a two-hour visit, to examine <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>. A hospital announcement said <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> doctors agreed on the necessary treatment and that <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s heart was in steady condition while his kidney problem was being dealt with. <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> is heading a caretaker government because no party received a majority in elections on June 18 to the 300-seat Parliament. The two-term premier, whose socialist <ORGANIZATION> Panhellenic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> was defeated in the elections, faces a Tuesday deadline to form a new government. He received the mandate Friday from President <PERSON> Christos </PERSON> <PERSON> Sartzetakis </PERSON> after conservatives, who finished first in the balloting, were unable to forge a coalition. <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> planned to meet with leaders of a communist-dominated alliance to build a coalition. The communist-dominated alliance, the Coalition of the Left and Progress, is next in line to attempt to form a government when <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s mandate expires. New elections will be held if that party ca n't form a coalition.

 Three bombs exploded, traffic halted and shops closed today during a nationwide strike called by Sinhalese extremists in support of 40,000 striking bus drivers. Two bombs exploded in the <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lavinia </LOCATION> and another was detonated in the suburb of <LOCATION> Narahenpitiya </LOCATION>, said a senior police official, who can not be identified under briefing rules. The blasts caused no casualties or damage and appeared intended to frighten people into staying home, the officer said. The <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, an extremist Sinhalese group, called the daylong strike and ordered people to stay inside their homes as a show of support for bus drivers who have been striking since June 12 for higher wages. `` We warn anti-national elements they will be shot or fall victim to explosive devices if they fail to heed our warning,'' said handwritten posters plastered throughout the capital and signed by <PERSON> Keerthi </PERSON> <PERSON> Wijebahu </PERSON>, commander of the front. The government ordered the bus drivers to either report for work on Monday or lose their jobs. But the ultimatium was ignored and soldiers were driving the government-owned buses. A few private vehicles plied the roads, bearing white flags indicating they were attending a funeral or on an urgent errand. Downtown <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, which is usually bustling by 9 a.m., was virtually deserted except for a few police officers. Businesses, banks and markets all closed their shutters. `` I can not find a shop to even buy a cigarette,'' said one policeman, speaking on condition of anonymity. The Sinhalese extremists oppose an Indian-brokered peace accord aimed at ending the 6-year-old conflict with the Tamils. It contends the accord grants too many concessions to the Tamils, who make up 18 percent of the island's 18 million people. Sinhalese make up 75 percent of the population and control the government and military. Since the accord was signed in July 1987, Sinhalese extremists have been blamed for killing more than 3,500 people. Most of the victims have been government officials and security personnel.

 Revelers dressed as sea monsters and playing kazoos held the second annual festival in honor of the humming toadfish, the underwater lovers who torment residents each summer with their rhapsodizing. `` We figured if we ca n't beat'em, join'em,'' said newly crowned Toadfish King <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, a cartoonist whose coronation was accompanied by kazoo music, the sound residents say is most like the love sputters of the toadfish. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> then led the dancing, leaping revelers along the dock Sunday as they played `` Yes, We Have No Bananas'' and `` The Battle Hymn of the Republic.'' The festival started a year ago after sleepless residents demanded to know the source of the noise that plagues the bayside town north of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> for three months each summer. The cry of the bulging-eyed, bubble-lipped creatures, a noise some likened to the sound of B-52 bombers, usually starts after dusk and lasts for hours, sometimes until 2 or 3 a.m. Residents at first advanced a number of theories, which <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, a 17-year resident of the town, lampooned in his comic strip `` Farley,'' which appears in a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> newspaper. Some held the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> was pumping nerve gas into the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. Others claimed a Japanese ship loaded with electric massagers sank in the bay's waters and lost its cargo, which buzzed on. A phone call to <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCosker </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Steinhart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aquarium </ORGANIZATION>, led to the discovery that the noise was not manmade. It seems that every summer sometime in June, the humming toadfish migrate to <LOCATION> Sausalito </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> <PERSON> Bay </PERSON> and emit the noise during their two - to three-month mating season The sound particularly reverberates through the cement foundations of houseboats. With the mystery solved, some residents have come to welcome the toadfish and the excuse they bring to drink beer, eat hot dogs and jigs in the street. `` It's just a goof,'' said resident <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Troise </PERSON>. `` The toadfish is the perfect thing for <LOCATION> Sausalito </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 In an apparent <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy shift, Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> said in an interview broadcast today that <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> should withdraw from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Also today, police said a bomb went off in a school in the Syrian-policed mountain town of <LOCATION> Dhour </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shweir </LOCATION>, wounding the principal, a teacher and seven schoolchildren. They had no other immediate details. `` The Syrians have to back off,'' <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> said on Christian-controlled Voice of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in an interview conducted by the station's <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> correspondent. `` All of the outside parties ought to back off and let the <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> make their own judgment about where their future lies. There is too much foreign involvement on all sides.'' His remarks in the taped interview reversed a statement he made before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on March 16. He said at that time that the withdrawal of Syrian troops from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> would aggravate the situation because their presence restrains the warring parties. The Syrians have 40,000 troops deployed in mainly Moslem areas in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> under a 1976 Arab League peacekeeping mandate. Along with Druse militia allies, the Syrians have been engaged in bloody fighting with army commander Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s 20,000 mainly Christian troops since March 8. Today's interview was broadcast during renewed Syrian shelling of the Christian coastline north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The Syrians are maintaining a blockade of the enclave to block military supplies sent by <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s main Arab foe. A police spokesman, who can not be identified under standing rules, said sporadic 130mm mortar fire hit around the ports of <LOCATION> Jounieh </LOCATION> and Byblos. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s artillery retaliated with 155mm howitzer fire on a seaside boulevard of Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> where several Syrian batteries are deployed. No casualties were reported today. By police count, 373 people have been killed and 1,460 wounded in the 14 weeks of bloodshed. <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON>'s interview was broadcast a day after Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> urged <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> leaders to show restraint to avert further bloodshed. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> made his appeal in identical letters to acting Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> and <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, who head the rival Moslem and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> cabinets in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s divided government. Aides to both leaders said <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s letter restated <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for Arab League efforts to end <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 14-year civil war. In today's interview, <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> also said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was optimistic about efforts by the three-member <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> committee on <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. It is made up of <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>, King Fahd of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and Algerian president <PERSON> Chadli </PERSON> <PERSON> Bendjedid </PERSON>. The panel was set up during an Arab summit in <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> last month. `` We're obviously very hopeful that the Arab committee can, in fact, bring sense to the situation and can convince the Syrians to withdraw plus all those other foreign parties that have gotten themselves involved in the tragedy of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON>. The Arab panel was given a six-month mandate to enforce a cease-fire, lift land and sea blockades stemming from the battles, and introduce political reforms to redistribute power between Moslems and Christians. The Arab committee is scheduled to meet in the Algerian town of <LOCATION> Oran </LOCATION> Tuesday to discuss its efforts. The respected <ORGANIZATION> An-Nahar </ORGANIZATION> newspaper quoted unidentified political and official sources today as saying <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> was bent on overthrowing <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> by military, economic or political means. But the independent daily said the military option was out because <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> has been notified that `` it was impermissible to invade -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>.'' It did not say who served the notification. The paper said the Syrians resorted to blockades of the Christain enclave hoping to incite Christians against <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>. `` But that has not worked, and the <ORGANIZATION> Syrians </ORGANIZATION> have only the political option left to get rid of <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>,'' the newspaper said. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> mounted the initial attacks in March and declared he wanted to drive <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> out of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Sales of Existing Homes Hit 16-Month Low in May</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
 Despite falling mortgage rates, sales of existing homes dropped 5.6 percent in May to their lowest level in 16 months, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION> reported today. The real estate trade group said existing single-family homes were sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.21 million units last month. The previous low was 3.2 million units in January 1988. The drop in May followed sales of 3.4 million units in both March and April, down 2 percent from February. The May resale rate was off 11.3 percent from the rate a year earlier. The weakness in sales this year has been blamed on rising home mortgage rates, reflecting efforts by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> to fight inflationary pressures by tightening the supply of credit. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has been easing its grip on credit recently. Fixed-rate mortgages have fallen from a high of 11.22 percent in March to 10.48 percent at the end of May, according the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` The psychological impact of last month's rate drops did n't hit the market until the end of May,'' said Realtors President <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gribin </PERSON>. `` In a month when activity usually picks up, sales still were slipping across the nation,'' he said. `` Buyers are not going to start flooding the markets the instant mortgage rates start to go down. It take time for the tide to change,'' <PERSON> Gribin </PERSON> said, predicting that June sales will be heavier as more people take advantage of lower rates. The median price for existing homes in May was $ 93,100, up $ 200 from April and 3.9 percent above that for May 1988, the Realtors said. The median is the point at which half of the homes sold for more and half for less. The sales decline in May was led by 10.1 percent drop in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, where sales fell to 800,000 units. The West, where sales had been strong, posted a resale pace decline of 8.1 percent below April, to 570,000 units. Sales of 590,000 units in the Northeast were 3.3 percent below April. Sales in the South dropped to 1.23 million units, down 3.9 percent from April's rate.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Keeps Suspense Going Over Abortion Decision</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Awaiting the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s decision in a <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> abortion dispute is no lonely vigil. And the justices today kept everyone waiting at least a few more days. On the next-to-the-last day of the term, the court handed down several decisions, including two sanctioning the death penalty for murderers who committed their crimes while age 16 or 17. But the court said nothing about abortion. That means the court would have to hand down a decision in the abortion case, <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> vs. Reproductive Health Services, on Thursday, the final day of the term, or schedule new arguments at the outset of the next term, which begins the first Monday in October. Never, it seems, have so many awaited a decision so anxiously, or made such a public display of their anxiety. The potential stakes are enormous. The court is being asked to use the <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> case to reverse or substantially limit its 1973 decision that women have a constitutional right to abortion. Such a ruling could allow states to outlaw abortion, or otherwise curtail legal abortions, which number 1.5 million each year. With time running out on the court's 1988-89 term, partisan lawyers gather in the hushed courtroom each day before the 10 a.m. starting time to catch the first word. Interest groups make known their availability to supply instant reactions. Scores of reporters jam the courtroom press row and the court's public information office a floor below. Satellite transmission trucks are parked nearby. Each day, the word passes quickly. `` No Webster today.'' Meanwhile, rumors abound and crash to earth. At least one such erroneous rumor got into print, after <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> went public with the `` scuttlebutt'' out of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that the decision would be announced June 19. `` We've never been through anything quite like this,'' says court spokeswoman <PERSON> Toni </PERSON> <PERSON> House </PERSON>. `` Hectic,'' she offers as a one-word summary. The most senior reporter covering the court, <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Denniston </PERSON> of The <ORGANIZATION> Baltimore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION>, says the anticipation is rivaled only by that experienced before the 1976 decisions reinstating capital punishment and the 1978 ruling in which the court first condoned the concept of affirmative action. `` Here you have the court contemplating taking away a constitutional right it created itself. The fact that is a real prospect now has captured everyone's attention,'' he said. On the day the abortion ruling is announced, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abortion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> will conduct an 11:30 a.m. news conference to give its appraisal of the Webster decision. Planned Parenthood will host a similar affair at noon; the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pro-Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Right </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> at 1:30; the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> at 2. The list goes on. A special edition of `` <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Week in Review'' is planned for public television. Many such organizations for weeks have sent representatives to the court to harvest each day's decision crop _ a recent day's single-file line stretched past 100 Messengers for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organizaton </ORGANIZATION> for Women, the American Life Lobby, congressional subcommittees and even one representing columnist <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Will </PERSON> share a peaceful co-existence. The abortion dispute officially has become the most closely watched case of the 1980s. A record number _ 78 _ of `` friend-of-the-court'' briefs was filed by individuals and organizations not part of the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> litigation. In a less formal, and likely less effective, form of lobbying, hundreds of thousands of <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION> wrote and telephoned the court to express their views. In the weeks leading up to the April 26 argument session conducted for the case, more than 20,000 letters addressed to the justices arrived daily. The court's two switchboards were so flooded with calls that a rarely used third board had to be activated. `` It's been a zoo,'' Ms. <PERSON> House </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Legislator Calls For Brezhnev Award to be Revoked</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A legislator today suggested the nation withdraw its highest military order from former <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>, who was given the honor 33 years after the end of World War II, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported. <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>, who rose to major general serving as a political officer in the war, was given the jewel-encrusted Order of Victory in 1978, the official agency said. He died in 1982. Supreme Soviet deputy <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Likhachev </PERSON> said many people see the decoration as one of <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>'s undeserved rewards. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> noted, however, that the legislature has no power to revoke the award. Such a move would further discredit <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>, who now is condemned widely for plunging the economy into a crisis and stagnating the rest of Soviet society. His name has been stripped off cities and ships, and his relatives have lost some benefits given to family members of a Soviet leader. The Supreme Soviet, the nation's first full-time lawmaking body, convened today to confirm <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> members and organize writing bills and ratifying treaties, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. These are new powers for the legislature, a division of the larger <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> Deputies that began work May 25. In closed hearings last week, legislative committees rejected at least four of more than 60 nominees to ministerial and other senior posts. The fight now moves to the full 542-member body. One chamber, the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalities </ORGANIZATION>, decided today that committees in both houses should consider bills before publication in the press, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported. Several deputies objected to the large number of military and defense industry representatives on a committee to oversee defense and the dreaded <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> secret police. But they were told experts were assigned deliberately to committees in their area of professional expertise, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION>, the government daily, reported today that the committee's hearings will be behind closed doors despite calls for more openness in those areas. The chamber approved the composition of its committees after changes, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said without elaborating. The legislature also is to consider bills on raising pensions and the rights of deputies, and to set priorities for tackling the nation's economic and social problems, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. The Soviet of Nationalities elected Ukrainian poet <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Oleinik </PERSON>, a reformer from <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION>, as one of its deputy chairmen, and the Soviet of Unions elected Moldavian <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Mokanu </PERSON> to a similar job. Monday's separate sessions of the two chambers, originally to be televised nationally, did not appear on the air or in the broadcast schedule. A spokeswoman at the state <PERSON> Gostelradio </PERSON> said officials decided there was no need to televise the session.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, declining to curtail enormous awards in personal-injury lawsuits, ruled today that the Constitution's ban on excessive fines places no limit on how much money may be won in such cases. By a 7-2 vote, the justices refused to extend the prohibition against excessive fines to civil as well as criminal cases. But the justices left open the possibility that the Constitution's due-process requirements could put a lid on punitive damage awards. That issue was not raised properly in the case decided today. The court upheld a $ 6 million award a jury ordered a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> waste-collection company to pay a <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> competitor. Justice <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> wrote for the court that the Constitution's Eighth Amendment, which bans cruel and unusual punishment and excessive fines, always has been interpreted to restrain governmental power in punishing criminals. `` Awards of punitive damages do not implicate these concerns,'' he said. `` We therefore hold, on the basis of the history and purpose of the Eighth Amendment, that its excessive-fines clause does not apply to awards of punitive damages in cases between private parties.'' But <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> hinted that the court might view the Constitution's due-process protections more liberally `` There is some authority in our opinions for the view that the due process clause places outer limits on the size of a civil damages award,'' he said. `` We have never addressed the precise question ... whether due process acts as a check on undue jury discretion to award punitive damages in the absence of any express statutory limit,'' <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> continued. `` That inquiry must await another day.'' <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> was joined by Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> and Justices <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, in a separate concurring opinion, practically invited a future challenge to large punitive damages based on the due process issue. `` I join the court's opinion on the understanding that it leaves the door open for a holding that the due process clause constrains the imposition of punitive damages in civil cases,'' <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said in an opinion for himself and <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>. Justices <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> dissented. They said punitive damages may violate the Constitution's ban on excessive fines. Today's case produced intense interest in the business community and among lawyers and consumer groups who have been battling for years over the legitimacy of multimillion-dollar awards in a range of lawsuits. Business leaders and others argue that skyrocketing damage judgments are catastrophic for American competitiveness and development of new products, particularly new forms of medical treatment. Consumer activists and trial lawyers say punitive damages are a powerful deterrent to corporate greed that poses a threat to public safety. Some state legislatures, reacting to soaring insurance rates, in recent years have imposed ceilings on how much money can be recovered in personal-injury cases. In today's case, the court was not asked nor did it rule on the constitutionality of such state `` tort reform'' laws. Today's ruling will influence juries and judges _ not legislators _ as they weigh penalties in lawsuits. The case involved a $ 6 million punitive damage award against <ORGANIZATION> Browning-Ferris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a waste-collection with headquarters in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. The company was ordered to pay the money to <ORGANIZATION> Kelco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disposal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vt. </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Browning-Ferris </ORGANIZATION>, with annual revenues exceeding $ 1.3 billion, decided in 1973 to enter the waste disposal business in <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> The company appointed <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON> to be district manager for its new regional office in <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON> left <ORGANIZATION> Browning-Ferris </ORGANIZATION> in 1980 to form his own company, <ORGANIZATION> Kelco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disposal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which soon became a direct competitor. <ORGANIZATION> Kelco </ORGANIZATION> captured more than 40 percent of the market in the <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION> region by 1982. There was testimony in the case that <ORGANIZATION> Browning-Ferris </ORGANIZATION> then instructed its new <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION> manager to `` put <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON> out of business. Do whatever it takes. Squish him like a bug.'' <ORGANIZATION> Browning-Ferris </ORGANIZATION> then cut its prices almost in half, a maneuver that prompted <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON> to file an antitrust suit charging the larger company with trying to monopolize the waste-collection market in the region. <ORGANIZATION> Browning-Ferris </ORGANIZATION> sold its <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> business after <ORGANIZATION> Kelco </ORGANIZATION> succeeded in winning more than half the market. After being repeatedly urged by <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON>'s lawyer to `` send a message to <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>'' and consider the wealth of the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> company, a <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> jury awarded <ORGANIZATION> Kelco </ORGANIZATION> $ 51,146 in compensatory damages and $ 6 million in punitive damages. The 2nd U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> upheld the full amount, concluding it was not `` constitutionally excessive.'' Proponents of large punitive damage awards say they deter illegal conduct, unlike smaller compensatory awards that may be viewed by large corporations as a cost of doing business. They also argue that wrongdoers often get off scot-free by going undetected or because many can not afford to sue. But those who favor limiting punitive damages say juries capriciously penalize the wealthy in order to benefit those who have suffered injuries, particularly if the victim is from nearby and the wrongdoer is from another state or region. They also say the costs to society are great _ in the form of skyrocketing liability insurance premiums, reduced health care and abandoned experimentation in new products. Tort-reform proponents cite studies that show punitive damages have gone through the roof in recent years. For example, one study showed that the average punitive damage award in personal injury cases in <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, was $ 14,000 for a five-year period ending in 1969 and $ 1.9 million for a comparable period concluding in 1984. The case is <ORGANIZATION> Browning-Ferris </ORGANIZATION> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Kelco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disposal </ORGANIZATION>, 88-556.

<TEXT>
 A pipe burst aboard a Soviet nuclear submarine in the <LOCATION> Norwegian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, causing a reactor malfunction and a fire but no injuries, Soviet officials said today. The sub billowed smoke today as it limped toward port. Norwegian officials criticized Soviet officials for not informing them fully of the accident, the second involving a Soviet vessel off <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> in less than a week and the third in three months. `` It is unsatisfactory for us as a neighboring state not to be warned,'' Defense Minister <PERSON> Johan </PERSON> <PERSON> Joergen </PERSON> <PERSON> Holst </PERSON> told a news conference. `` It is unacceptable,'' Foreign Minister <PERSON> Thorvald </PERSON> <PERSON> Stolenberg </PERSON> said. No radiation leaks were reported aboard the vessel, which was of a class built in the 1960s to carry nuclear-tipped cruise missiles. In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, Soviet Defense Minister <PERSON> Dmitri </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> said the accident happened on the sub's energy apparatus while the sub was submerged. A pipeline of a reactor burst and its seal was broken, the government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> quoted him as saying. <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> said the sub switched to backup diesel engines, surfaced and took on water to cool the reactor. He said all crew members were safe and the accident did not damage the environment. <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> said another Soviet vessel would escort the ship east to <LOCATION> Severomorsk </LOCATION>. Soviet media did not give the name of the Echo II class submarine or say whether it was carrying nuclear weapons. A Norwegian Northern Defense Command spokesman said the submarine, with both nuclear and conventional power, apparently caught fire at about 5 a.m. in the Norwegian Sea off northern <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>. `` We received a telex from <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Murmansk </LOCATION> rescue central ... at about 9:45 a.m. that said the situtation was under control, the crew was in good shape and that there was no danger of a radiation leak,'' Maj. <PERSON> Arne </PERSON> <PERSON> Skjaerpe </PERSON> said by telephone. The submarine was first spotted by Norwegian aircraft 70 northwest of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, which is part of the northern province of <LOCATION> Finnmark </LOCATION>. The vessel's crew fired a rocket and waved off a <LOCATION> Norwegian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> <LOCATION> King </LOCATION> rescue helicopter to indicate it did not want civilian help, said <PERSON> Terje </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lien </PERSON>, an official at the <ORGANIZATION> Norway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coordination </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Bodoe </LOCATION>. Officials said it was emitting smoke, possibly from an auxiliary motor. The Echo II class dates from the early 1960s. It is nuclear-powered and normally carries nuclear weapons. The authoritative British handbook `` <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>'s Fighting Ships'' said Echo II submarines are 380 feet long, have crews of 90 and eight missile silos built for cruise missiles. The reference says the vessels have two nuclear reactors and two steam turbines. `` It was a malfunction in the main power plant,'' the official Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. `` According to commander of the submarine, there was a breakdown in the system that insures air and water tightness of the reactor. The reactor has been shut down. There are no casualties,'' the report said. The submarine was on the surface and moving toward home under its own power. Ships and aircraft of the Soviet northern fleet have been sent to the area, the report said. <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s rescue coordination center said the submarine was first spotted at 71 degrees 36 minutes north and 21 degrees 5 minutes east. On April 7, a Soviet Mike-class submarine caught fire and sank in the <LOCATION> Norwegian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, killing 42 Soviet sailors. On June 20, Soviet cruise ship <PERSON> Maxim </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorky </PERSON> was torn open by ice and nearly sank near <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Spitzbergen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. No casualties were reported among the roughly 950 people aboard.

<HEAD>Court Says Police Can Stray From Warning Language</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today gave police permission to stray from the precise wording of the famous Miranda warnings given to criminal suspects. The decision, reached by a 5-4 vote, reinstated an <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> man's conviction and 35-year prison sentence for attempted murder The warning, familiar to every fan of television police shows, was created by the high court in a 1966 decision called Miranda vs. <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>. It was designed to bolster criminal suspects' Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. Under the court ruling, police must warn suspects in custody of their right to remain silent, that anything they say can be used against them and that they have a right to a lawyer's help before answering any questions. Suspects also must be told that a lawyer will be provided to them if they can not afford to hire one and that the warnings must be given before any police interrogation begins. In the case decided today, <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, police questioned <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Eagan </PERSON> in 1982 about an attempted murder after reading him a warning that included this paragraph: `` You have a right to the advice and presence of a lawyer even if you can not afford one. We have no way of giving you a lawyer but one will be appointed for you, if you wish, if and when you go to court.'' <PERSON> Eagan </PERSON> subsequently confessed to the crime, and did so again 29 hours later after being read a Miranda warning that did not include the `` if and when'' language. Like some other states, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> does not provide pennyless criminal suspects with free lawyers until their first appearance in court. The Miranda right to a lawyer's help is accommodated by police not initiating any contact with a suspect who has asked for legal help. The 7th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled in <LOCATION> Eagan </LOCATION>'s case that the `` if and when'' language of the warning <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON> police gave him was confusing. The wording could lead someone to think he properly may be questioned by police without a lawyer, the appeals court said. Other federal appeals courts have allowed warnings containing such wording. Today, the justices said the 7th Circuit court was wrong. `` In our view, the court of appeals misapprehended the effect of the inclusion of the ` if and when you go to court' language in Miranda warnings,'' Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> wrote. `` This instruction accurately described the procedure for the appointment of counsel in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>,'' he said. The court also ruled that the 1966 <PERSON> Miranda </PERSON> decision does not require that lawyers be provided as soon as they are requested _ only that police halt their questioning. Justices <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> joined <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> in the majority. Justices <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> dissented. In a 1981 decision, the court said `` talismanic incantations'' of a defendant's rights are not required so long as the right to a lawyer's help is not linked to `` a future point in time after the police interrogation.'' Both <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> prosecutors and <PERSON> Eagan </PERSON> cited the 1981 ruling as favorable to their side. <PERSON> Eagan </PERSON> telephoned <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> police on May 16, 1982 and told them he had found a dead, naked woman along the <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> shore in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. When he led police to her, the still-alive woman looked at <LOCATION> Eagan </LOCATION> and exclaimed, `` Why did you stab me?'' The woman later testified that <PERSON> Eagan </PERSON> and two other men had taken her to the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> beach from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and that she had sex with the two other men. When she refused <PERSON> Eagan </PERSON>, she said, he stabbed her. <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> police turned the case over to <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON> police. The case is <PERSON> Duckworth </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Eagan </PERSON>, 88-317.

<TEXT>
 The Afghan government will free rebel prisoners in exchange for Soviet soldiers captured by guerrillas during the 10-year-old war, rebel sources said today. Soviet diplomats, however, said final approval of the prisoner swap must come from the Soviet-backed government in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. An exchange agreement was reached at a fourth round of talks today between Moslem guerrilla representatives and the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, a guerrilla spokesman said on condition of anonymity. He said both sides will exchange lists of prisoners at talks to be held within the next week. He said the Soviets endorsed the principle of exchanging prisoners at one time, en masse, as previously demanded by the insurgents. A Soviet Embassy statement, however, said <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> will open talks with <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> on the proposed exchange. `` If the Russians agreed then <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> will also,'' the guerrilla spokesman said. The guerrillas claim 40,000 of their people are missing in action. They say they are holding between 50 and 75 Soviet soldiers inside <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> says 311 of its troops have gone missing since its sent troops to bolster the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government's fight against the anti-communist guerrillas nine years ago. The last Red Army troops withdrew in February under a U.N.-brokered agreement. This latest round of prisoner negotiations comes while an eight-member <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> delegation is visiting <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, including three mothers and a father of <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> soldiers missing in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. They insist their group is unofficial. Delegation spokesman <PERSON> Iona </PERSON> <PERSON> Andronov </PERSON> said that over the past two days, `` We spoke with the proper people in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>'' and received assurances that `` we can arrange for this exchange.'' The Soviet parents sought information about their children during a meeting last week with guerrilla leaders in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s frontier city, <LOCATION> Peshawar </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Andronov </PERSON> said the delegation promised to reciprocate with information about missing Afghan guerrillas.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today rejected arguments by citizen groups in <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, that a federal judge illegally ordered construction of 1,000 low-cost homes to help desegregate the city. The justices, without comment, threw out an appeal by <ORGANIZATION> Save </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yonkers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and others. It contended that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> B </PERSON>. Sand exceeded his authority in ordering the desegregation plan. The <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION> case attracted national attention a year ago when four <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION> councilmen refused to obey Sand's orders to adopt the plan and were fined $ 3,500 each for contempt of court. Faced with massive layoffs of city workers, the city council reversed itself on Sept. 10, 1988, by voting to comply with the judge's order to build the low-cost homes. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> last March agreed to decide whether Sand had the power to fine the councilmen. A ruling in that case is expected sometime in 1990. But the high court previously left intact Sand's 1985 ruling that <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION> officials intentionally and unlawfully promoted racial segregation through their housing and school policies. The suit against the officials was begun by the federal government in the waning days of President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s administration in 1980 In the case acted on today, the citizens groups said Sand's order to build the homes in middle-class areas would leave untouched racial segregation in the city's predominantly black Hispanic area. The case is Save <ORGANIZATION> Yonkers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> vs. Sand, 88-1767.

<HEAD>Court Eases Use of Racketeering Law in Civil Suits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, broadly interpreting a key federal anti-racketeering law, made it easier today to use the law in civil lawsuits against businesses accused of fraud. The court said unanimously that the law applies to more than what is traditionally described as organized crime. Also, Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said for the court that to prove a pattern of racketeering activity under the law, a private plaintiff or a prosecutor must show at least two criminal acts `` within a single scheme that were related and that amounted to, or threatened the likelihood of, continued criminal activity.'' <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> rejected arguments that a plaintiff or prosecutor must prove `` separate illegal schemes'' to demonstrate a pattern of racketeering activity. Moreover, he continued, the law is designed to apply to more than traditional organized crime. `` The occasion for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' action was the perceived need to combat organized crime,'' <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said. `` But <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for cogent reasons chose to enact a more general statute, one which, although it had organized crime as its focus, was not limited in application to organized crime.'' The court unanimously reinstated a lawsuit against <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> by <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> consumers. The suit was based on alleged violations of the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO. The 8th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> dismissed the suit, which accused Northwestern Bell of bribing state public utility officials. The consumers say the phone company in 1980 began trying illegally to win rate increases by offering gifts, employment and other favors to members of the <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utilities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. The appeals court ruled that the phone company's customers failed to prove `` a pattern of racketeering activity'' required to make a case under RICO. The 8th Circuit court said a single fraudulent scheme is insufficient, ruling that at least two schemes must be alleged. Other federal appeals courts have allowed civil RICO suits based on numerous acts advancing only one fraudulent scheme. It is not unusual nowadays to find at least one RICO claim in lawsuits involving virtually any business dispute. The stigma attached to being linked in public court documents to alleged racketeering can be powerful leverage for out-of-court settlements. Winners of RICO lawsuits may collect triple damages and lawyer fees, both of which generally are not available under state anti-fraud laws. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyers, in a friend-of-the-court brief submitted last year, sided with the phone customers in urging the justices to interpret the RICO law broadly and reinstate the lawsuit. Also backing the customers were 14 states _ <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>. Other interests urged the high court to bar the lawsuit. For example, the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> said in a friend-of-the-court brief that `` private civil RICO actions have become a tool of harassment ... against legitimate businesses and labor organizations.'' During an oral argument session before the justices last November, a lawyer for <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> said the 1970 law is aimed at thwarting organized crime, and should not be used against otherwise legitimate businesses accused of fraud. But the lawyer representing the company's customers said businesses that engage in fraudulent acts `` forfeit the right to call themselves legitimate.'' The case is H.J. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION>, 87-1252.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today rejected appeals by three convicted drug dealers who said Italian-Americans unlawfully were barred from serving as jurors at their trial. The court, without comment, left intact the case of the three men convicted in connection with the shipment of cocaine from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. The three are <PERSON> Giacomo </PERSON> <PERSON> DiNorscio </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, each sentenced to 30 years in prison, and <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Truglia </PERSON>, sentenced to 10 years. At their 1986 trial in <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, federal prosecutors used what are known as peremptory _ or automatic _ challenges to exclude five potential jurors with Italian surnames. The defendants said elimination of those potential jurors violated a 1986 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling that said prosecutors never may disqualify potential jurors based on their race. The 1986 case involved exclusion of black potential jurors, and the justices said prosecutors must explain their reasons for peremptory challenges if there is evidence the exclusions are racially motivated. The 3rd U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> last December ruled against the defendants in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> case. The appeals court said they failed to show that `` persons with Italian surnames ... are themselves an identifiable ethnic group that shares common backgrounds and ideas linked to a single culture and group loyalties.'' The appeals court said there was no evidence `` this group has been systematically excluded from jury service in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>.'' The 3rd Circuit court also said the defendants failed to prove any actual prejudice against them, particularly since two jurors who did serve at the trial had Italian surnames. Claims by <PERSON> DiNorscio </PERSON> and <PERSON> Truglia </PERSON> that five years was tacked on to their prison sentences improperly also were rejected by the appeals court. The five years were added under a federal law that permits longer sentences for defendants who commit crimes while free on bail awaiting trial. The defendants said they were not alerted to the possibility of the additional prison sentences when freed on bail. The appeals court also rejected <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>'s argument that he was indicted by a grand jury that lacked adequate representation by blacks, Hispanic-Americans and people with less than high school educations. The cases are <PERSON> DiNorscio </PERSON> vs. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, 88-1664, and <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> vs. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, 88-6875.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Will Hear Appeal in Houston Labor Dispute</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today agreed to set guidelines on when employers may withdraw recognition of a labor union after hiring new workers to break a strike. The court said it will hear a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration appeal of a ruling favoring an employer in a case stemming from a 1979 strike against a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> laboratory supplies company. <ORGANIZATION> Curtin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Matheson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scientific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> was struck in 1979 by workers at its warehouse in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> after a union contract expired and the company locked out all 27 <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> union members employed there. Five of the 27 employees crossed the picket line when the strike began June 13, 1979. The company 12 days later hired 29 new employees to replace the remaining 22 strikers. When the union later offered to end the strike under terms previously offered by management, the company withdrew the offer along with its recognition of the union as the workers' bargaining agent. The National Labor Relations Board in 1987 said the company illegally withdrew its recognition of the union. The board said the company acted without adequate reason to believe the union lacked support from a majority of the workers then at the plant. The 5th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> overruled the board last November. `` The company was justified in doubting that the striker replacements supported the union,'' the appeals court said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration lawyers said the labor board properly refused to accept the company's presumption that the union had lost the support of the majority of workers. Strikebreakers may choose to work for financial reasons or they may disapprove of a strike while still supporting the union, <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyers told the court. The case is <ORGANIZATION> NLRB </ORGANIZATION> vs. <PERSON> Curtin </PERSON> <PERSON> Matheson </PERSON>, 88-1685.

<TEXT>
 Justice Minister <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Meridor </PERSON> today said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> should deport more <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> activists in its efforts to end the 18-month-old Palestinian uprising in the occupied territories. In the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports today said the body of a woman suspected of cooperating with Israeli security forces was found in the city of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>. She had been beaten to death with clubs and sharp objects. In <LOCATION> Ramle </LOCATION>, peace activist <PERSON> Abie </PERSON> <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> today went on trial on charges of violating an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> law that bans contacts with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON>, 63, was indicted late last year for meeting <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> and several of his aides in <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in September 1988. <PERSON> Meridor </PERSON> called for more deportations of Palestinians in an interview on <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION>, one day after the justice and defense ministries formed a committee to devise tougher measures against Palestinian protesters. `` I think deportation is serious but must be used, I would say perhaps even more than what has been done until now,'' <PERSON> Meridor </PERSON> said. `` I think it's an effective punishment when we have appropriate evidence.'' Palestinians said the slain woman, <PERSON> Sabah </PERSON> <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Khadi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kanaan </PERSON>, 30, was accused of collaborating with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s secret police. At least 68 suspected collaborators have been killed by other Palestinians since the uprising began in December 1987 in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. A total of 536 Palestinians and 23 Israelis have died during the revolt. The new committee on putting down the uprising was formed Sunday to examine proposals by Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> for speeding deportations and the demolishion of houses of Palestinians suspected of security offenses. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> also reportedly wants to lengthen the period for holding Arab suspects without trial from six months t a year. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and human rights organizations repeatedly have criticized all three methods of punishment because they are carried out without due process of law or violate international conventions on human rights. Israeli news reports said that <PERSON> Meridor </PERSON> had resisted some of the steps proposed by <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Meridor </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> that he expected stronger measures, especially on deporations, could be worked out `` in a few days.'' <PERSON> Meridor </PERSON> said 50 deportations have been carried out since the start of the uprising, and another five are being appealed before <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> courts. He said nearly 300 houses have been demolished or sealed.

 States are free to impose the death penalty for murderers who committed their crimes while age 16 and 17, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled today. Separately, the court ruled that the Constitution does not categorically prohibit the execution of mentally retarded killers. But in splintered voting in a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> case, the court said sentencing juries and judges must be allowed to take into consideration a murder defendant's mental retardation. Ruling in juvenile-killings cases, the justices voted 5-4 that the death penalty for older juvenile killers does not violate the Constitution's ban on `` cruel and unusual punishment.'' The ruling could affect about 25 of the some 2,200 death row inmates across the nation. An eagerly anticipated decision on abortions, <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> vs. Reproductive Health Services, was not announced today. The court also meets on Thursday, which is the last day of the term. If the <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> decision does not come down Thursday, the court could order a re-hearing in the term beginning the first Monday in October. In other action today, the court: _ Ruled the Constitution's ban on excessive fines places no limit on how much money can be won in personal-injury lawsuits. By a 7-2 vote, the justices refused to extend the prohibition against the excessive fines to civil as well as criminal cases. _ Gave police permission to stray from the precise wording of the famous Miranda warnings given to criminal suspects. The decision, reached by a 5-4 vote, reinstated an <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> man's attempted-murder conviction and 35-year prison sentence _ Made it easier to use the law in civil lawsuits against businesses accused of fraud. Broadly interpreting a key federal anti-racketeering law, the court unanimously ruled that the law applies to more than what is traditionally described as organized crime. In the juvenile-killer decision, the court upheld the death sentences of two young killers in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>. They were 16 and 17, respectively, when they committed their crimes. Justice <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> wrote for the court that no national consensus exists against the execution of murderers who committed their crimes while minors. In the decision involving capital punishment for mentally retarded killers, the court threw out a convicted <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> murderer's death sentence, but rejected his lawyers' arguments that capital punishment always is impermissible for retarded murderers <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> said in the juvenile-killer decision that of the 37 states permitting capital punishment, 15 decline to impose it for anyone who committed the crime when not yet 18. `` This does not establish the degree of national consensus this court has previously thought sufficient to label a particular punishment cruel and unusual,'' <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> said. He was joined in that holding by Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> and Justices <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. Justices <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> dissented. The justices, in effect, drew the allowable line for capital punishment at age 16 last year when they voted, 5-3, to throw out the death sentence of an <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> killer who committed his crime when 15. Today, that line held up. In the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> case, <PERSON> Heath </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkins </PERSON>, now 20, was sentenced to die by lethal injection for murdering liquor store clerk <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> during a 1985 robbery in <ORGANIZATION> Avondale </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wilkins </PERSON> first stabbed Mrs. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, the 26-year-old mother of two, in the back and chest. As she pleaded for mercy, he stabbed her four times in the throat. The robbery netted for <PERSON> Wilkins </PERSON> and three other homeless teen-agers $ 450 in cash and checks, cigarettes, rolling papers, cheap wine and peppermint schnapps. In the <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> case, <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanford </PERSON> was sentenced to death in the state's electric chair for the 1981 abduction and murder of <PERSON> Baerbel </PERSON> <PERSON> Poore </PERSON>, 20, a gas station attendant in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION>, now 25, and two others robbed the station of $ 143.07 in cash, 300 cartons of cigarettes and two gallons of gasoline. Police said <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> and another teen-ager sexually abused and terrorized Ms. <PERSON> Poore </PERSON> in the gas station's bathroom, then forced her into her car and drove to a wooded area. <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> allowed Ms. <PERSON> Poore </PERSON> a last cigarette, then shot her twice in the head. The Clearinghouse on <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prisons </ORGANIZATION> and Jails, a group opposed to capital punishment, estimates that between 12 percent and 20 percent of the some 2,200 people on death rows across the nation function at below-average intelligence. The justices split 5-4 in ruling that <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Penry </PERSON>'s rights were violated because his sentencing jury was not given a sufficient opportunity to take his mental capacity into account. <PERSON> Penry </PERSON> has the reasoning capacity of a 7-year-old. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> formed the majority on that portion of the decision sparing, at least for now, <PERSON> Penry </PERSON>'s life. But a separate voting bloc _ <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON>, White, <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> _ prevailed in a separate 5-4 decision that stopped short of outlawing capital punishment for all retarded killers. `` While a national consensus against execution of the mentally retarded may someday emerge reflecting the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society, there is insufficient evidence of such a consensus today,'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> wrote. Jurors who sentenced <PERSON> Penry </PERSON> were told they could consider all evidence presented by the defense, which included testimony about <PERSON> Penry </PERSON>'s retardation. But the judge refused to make special instructions aimed at highlighting <PERSON> Penry </PERSON>'s mental condition. For example, <PERSON> Penry </PERSON>'s trial lawyer had requested that the word `` deliberately'' be defined for jurors. Today, the court said that when such a request is made, it must be honored. <PERSON> Penry </PERSON>, 32, was sentenced to die by lethal injection for the 1979 murder of <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON> <PERSON> Moseley </PERSON> <PERSON> Carpenter </PERSON>, 22, in <LOCATION> Livingston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Prosecutors said <PERSON> Penry </PERSON> raped the young woman and then killed her so she could not identify him for authorities. She lived long enough to give police a description of her assailant. Mrs. <PERSON> Carpenter </PERSON>, the sister of former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Football </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> placekicker <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Moseley </PERSON>, was stabbed repeatedly in the chest with a scissors she had been using to make Halloween decorations. The cases are <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> vs. <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, 87-5765, <PERSON> Wilkins </PERSON> vs. <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, 87-6026, and <PERSON> Penry </PERSON> vs. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, 87-6177.

<HEAD>Court Sets Aside Ruling in New Orleans Civil Rights Case</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today set aside a ruling that a key civil rights law does not protect aliens from discrimination by businesses or other private citizens. The high court ordered a lower court to reconsider the case of a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> man from <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> who was denied a bank credit card because he is not a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen. The justices said the lower court should restudy the case in light of the high court's June 15 ruling reaffirming that a century-old civil rights law applies to alleged discrimination by private citizens. The <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> was accused of illegal bias by <PERSON> Jeetendra </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhandari </PERSON>, a citizen of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> who applied for a Visa or Master Card credit card in 1983. Bank officials said they rejected <PERSON> Bhandari </PERSON>'s application in part because he is not a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen. <PERSON> Bhandari </PERSON>, an accountant, sued the bank in federal court. He charged it with violating a post-Civil War law _ now commonly referred to as Section 1981 _ that prohibits racial discrimination. The entire 5th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, by a 7-6 vote, ruled last October that Section 1981 does not ban private acts of discrimination against aliens. Judge <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Gee </PERSON>, in his opinion for the court's majority, said, `` Racial and citizenship distinctions are things of a different kind. The latter is not so readily and roundly condemned.'' He added: `` When all is said and done, patriotism remains a civic virtue; and one whose allegiance is bound to another nation may not be suited for certain callings in ours. And while the alien guest is not without his own special claims upon us, arising from our moral tradition, they are of a different quality from those grounded in our common humanity.'' The appeals court noted that at the time of its ruling there was a split on the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on whether Section 1981 bans private acts of discrimination _ as opposed to bias practiced by government _ even against blacks or other racial minorities. The high court announced on April 25, 1988, it would consider overturning its own 1976 decision allowing people to use Section 1981 to sue private citizens for race discrimination. But on June 15 the justices upheld the 1976 ruling _ while also deciding that the 19th Century law does not permit suits charging on-the-job racial harassment. Also, the court in May 1987 expanded the scope of Section 1981 to include not only racial minorities but Jews, Arabs and other ethnic groups as well. <PERSON> Bhandari </PERSON>, in the appeal acted on today, said the 5th Circuit court dismissal of his suit conflicts with high court precedent. The appeals court ruling `` presents a direct conflict with -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- decisions holding that Section 1981 prohibits discrimination against non-citizens based on alienage and that Section 1981 prohibits discrimination in the making of private contracts,'' lawyers for <PERSON> Bhandari </PERSON> said. The case is <PERSON> Bhandari </PERSON> vs. <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, 87-1293.

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Kill Lawsuit Against Two Chicago Lawyers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today refused to kill a 1984 lawsuit against two <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> lawyers stemming from their defending the city against charges of discrimination within its police department. The court, without comment, turned away arguments that government defense lawyers never may be sued for civil damages based on what they do for their public client in a case. Nineteen <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> police officers sued the city and various officials in 1984, alleging discrimination in employment. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>, then the city's corporation counsel, and <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON>, one of <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>'s top assistants, represented <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> in the case. They were named as defendants in a subsequent lawsuit. It alleges that <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> violated the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act by hiring an investigative firm to obtain through false pretenses credit reports on the police officers who had sued the city. The suit against <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> alleges that they intended to use the information to embarrass and intimidate the officers. <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> sought to have the lawsuit against them dismissed. They said they are entitled to absolute immunity from civil liability because the alleged misconduct occurred as part of their representing <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> in the job-discrimination suits. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Leinenweber </PERSON> refused to dismiss the suit, and the 7th <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> upheld his ruling last Oct. 21. The appeals court said that because the alleged misconduct was investigatory in nature, and allegedly occurred outside federal rules, it was `` removed from the judicial process and -LRB- is -RRB- not a function that rests uniquely within the duties of an advocate.'' Throughout most of its opinion, the appeals court seemed to acknowledge that government defense lawyers are entitled to the same absolute immunity from civil lawsuits afforded government prosecutors. But in concluding, the appeals court said, `` We express no opinion on whether, under similar circumstances, the unique functions performed by prosecuting attorneys would entitle them to greater immunity than afforded government defense counsel.'' In the appeal acted on today, <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Counsel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> H. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Miner </ORGANIZATION> represented <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON>. He said the appeals court ruling `` is a dangerous narrowing of immunity -LRB- that -RRB- will damage, rather than promote, the public concerns that gave rise to the doctrine of absolute immunity for public attorneys.'' Miner added, `` This is the first case to deny government defense attorneys absolute immunity for conduct alleged to have been undertaken in the course of representing their public client.'' The case is <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Auriemma </PERSON>, 88-1439.

<HEAD>Orders Restudy of Dispute Over Philadelphia Transit Drug Testing</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today ordered a lower court to restudy a dispute over drug and alcohol testing for employees of a mass transit agency in the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> area. The justices said the lower court should re-examine its ruling in light of recent decisions that allowed the <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> railroad to adopt drug tests for its workers without first bargaining with its unions and allowed mandatory drug testing of railroad employees involved in accidents. In the case acted on today, a lower court ruling was challenged by both the workers and their employer, the <ORGANIZATION> Southeastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>, known as <ORGANIZATION> SEPTA </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> SEPTA </ORGANIZATION> and its workers are unhappy with different aspects of a ruling last December by the 3rd <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>. The appeals court said <ORGANIZATION> SEPTA </ORGANIZATION> did not violate the privacy rights of employees in `` safety sensitive'' jobs by requiring them to undergo random drug and alcohol tests. But the appeals court, based on narrower grounds, barred the agency from testing any employees covered by the federal Railway Labor Act. The federal law bars railroads from unilaterally adopting any such major change in working conditions, the appeals court said. It said the unions that challenged the tests are entitled to mediation and conciliation procedures spelled out by the law. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled on June 19 that <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> may use previously approved physical fitness tests to screen for drug use. It said the addition of drug screening is a minor change not warranting collective bargaining. <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION>'s tests are not random. They are to be administered periodically to all workers during routine physical examinations. In addition, employees returning to work after an absence would have to undergo the tests. The high court last March 21 issued two key rulings on drug and alcohol testing in the workplace. The justices upheld blood and urine tests for railroad workers involved in accidents, and upheld urine tests for <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> employees seeking drug-enforcement jobs. In the case acted on today, <ORGANIZATION> SEPTA </ORGANIZATION> announced in 1987 its plan to require random urine and breathalyzer tests for thousands of workers with jobs affecting the safety of its more than a million daily bus, train, streetcar and subway riders. The agency also adopted tests for employees returning to work after absences. Those tests were declared unconstitutional by the 3rd Circuit court, and <ORGANIZATION> SEPTA </ORGANIZATION> and its unions subsequently reached a settlement on the return-to-work tests. The cases are <ORGANIZATION> SEPTA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> VS. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, 88-1486, and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> vs. <ORGANIZATION> SEPTA </ORGANIZATION>, 88-1653.

The action comes 11 days after the justices ruled that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has the power to strip state governments of their constitutional immunity against private lawsuits. At issue in the <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> case was whether such state immunity should be overcome. Lower courts said no. A policy of the <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>'s division of employment and training of refusing to pay unemployment benefits to some previously employed aliens lawfully living in the state sparked a 1984 lawsuit. The suit sought to have the policy declared a violation of the Federal Unemployment Tax Act and to collect benefits it alleged were wrongfully withheld. A federal trial judge ruled that the aliens would have to pursue their claims through state administrative proceedings. The aliens appealed, but the 10th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> dismissed the suit Nov. 29. Noting that state court rulings and changes in immigration law made clear that the aliens were eligible for unemployment benefits, the appeals court rendered moot the need for future relief. Regarding the claims for back benefits, the 10th Circuit court said the 11th Amendment prohibits such a raid on the state treasury in federal court. The amendment says: `` The judicial power of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should not be construed to extend to any suit ... -LRB- against a state -RRB- by citizens of another state or by citizens or subjects of any foreign state.'' In decisions dating back to 1890, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has barred anyone, in-state or out, from suing an unconsenting state _ or state officials if the real target is a state's treasury. But in recent years, the court has allowed some federal court lawsuits against states. In the case today, lawyers for the aliens said the 10th Circuit court's bar on federal suits to recover back unemployment benefits was in conflict with rulings by other federal appeals courts. The case is <PERSON> Esparza </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON>, 88-1432.

<HEAD>Court Rejects Illinois Doctor's Appeal in Lawyers-Fee Case</HEAD>

 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today rejected an appeal by an <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> doctor ordered to pay $ 254,000 in lawyers' fees to those who successfully challenged a state abortion law. The court, consistent with a ruling by the justices last week in an airline industry bias cae, let stand a lower court ruling stemming from a 1979 lawsuit challenging an <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> abortion-regulating law that included criminal penalties for physicians who violated it. A group of doctors sued various state officials, saying the law violated physicians' rights and those of their patients. A federal judge barred enforcement of the law. Soon thereafter, Dr. <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Diamond </PERSON> and two others asked to intervene in the case as defenders of the law. <PERSON> Diamond </PERSON> said he was acting to defend his patients' interests and his own professional interests. Diamond and another doctor, who has since died, appealed to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in 1985 to overrule lower court decisions and reinstate the law. State officials dropped out of the case, declining to pursue it to the nation's high court. The justices in 1986 ruled that <ORGANIZATION> Diamond </ORGANIZATION> lacked legal standing to appeal, thus leaving intact the victory won by the law's challengers. A federal judge and the 7th <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> subsequently ordered <ORGANIZATION> Diamond </ORGANIZATION> to help reimburse the winners' legal fees. His share of the attorneys' fees, with interest, is $ 254,000. The 7th Circuit court ruled last May that Diamond can be forced to help pay the fees even though he did not violate the constitutional rights of those who challenged the law. Only public officials and their agents may commit constitutional violations. The public officials in the case were sued under a key civil rights law that authorizes reimbursement of attorneys' fees to encourage legal representation for those whose rights are violated. Diamond and the others who intervened in the case in defense of the law `` for all practical purposes'' became the `` alter ego'' of the state officials, the appeals court said. `` We can not ... ignore the fact that the intervenors' unilateral decision ... to join with the state defendants in adamantly defending the constitutionality of the abortion act rendered them full-fledged parties to the lawsuit,'' the appeals court said. It added that the intervenors `` were thoroughly beaten'' in numerous court proceedings by the law's challengers. The appeals court also rejected Diamond's arguments that forcing him to help pay the other side's legal fees chills his free-speech rights. A fee reimbursement system is not unlawful `` simply because it forces those who choose voluntarily to interject themselves into such lawsuits to think twice before engaging in battle,'' the appeals court said. The case is Diamond vs. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, 88-664.

<HEAD>Court Sets Aside Ruling in Handicapped Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today told a lower court to consider freeing <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> officials from having to continue an educational program for a blind, severely retarded man after he turns 22. The justices set aside a ruling that required continued state support, and told a federal appeals court to restudy its ruling in light of their June 15 decision in a <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> case. That decision shields states from federal court lawsuits seeking to enforce a federal law to help handicapped children. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> case involves <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> <PERSON> Burr </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> who turned 21 on Dec. 30. <PERSON> Burr </PERSON> attended, at public expense, a private school for blind and retarded youngsters until he was 16. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> officials helped pay the cost under the federal Education of the Handicapped Act, which requires an appropriate free public education for handicapped individuals up to age 22. When the private school closed in 1984, <PERSON> Burr </PERSON> was referred to a state-supported school, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> for the Education of the Blind. That school refused to accept him, saying he needed training in `` life skills'' and was too retarded to have any academic potential. A state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> hearing officer ruled 18 months after the private school closed that <PERSON> Burr </PERSON> should be admitted. The institute appealed to the state commissioner of education, who upheld the decision three months later. <PERSON> Burr </PERSON> was allowed to attend the institute's program for those with multiple handicaps. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> and <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Burr </PERSON> sued in an attempt to win compensation for the two years their son was out of school while the case was reviewed. The 2nd U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled in December that federal regulations requiring prompt consideration of such cases were `` grossly violated.'' `` It is true that a handicapped child does not have a right to demand public education beyond the age of 21,'' the appeals court said. `` Nevertheless, we believe that <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> is entitled to a remedy for a deprivation of the right that the -LRB- federal -RRB- statute clearly provided him _ a free appropriate education between the ages of 3 and 21.'' The case is <PERSON> Sobol </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Burr </PERSON>, 88-1493.

 <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said today it will move its 6,000-employee retailing arm from the Sears Tower to the suburbs, ending a bidding war that pitted the state of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> against the <ORGANIZATION> Sunbelt </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> said the nation's largest retailer was offered $ 61 million in state incentives to stay in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> has been based in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> for more than a century. `` We believe this Chicagoland location will serve the best interests of our company and its shareholders for decades to come,'' Chairman <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said in a statement. <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said the move to <ORGANIZATION> Hoffman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estates </ORGANIZATION>, 20 miles outside <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, will begin in 2 -LCB- to 3 years. Last fall, <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> announced a restructuring plan that included selling the 110-story Sears Tower _ the world's tallest building _ and shifting <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merchandise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> and its 6,000 employees to less costly quarters. When the move is completed, only about 600 employees of <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>' corporate staff will remain in the <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION> in space leased from whoever buys the tower <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>' huge catalog sales operation is already based elsewhere. The Merchandise Group's move pitted <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> against <ORGANIZATION> Sunbelt </ORGANIZATION> states, especially <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, which scrambled to offer tax breaks and other incentives. The <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> offered an estimated $ 61 million, and local tax breaks will be worth about $ 178 million _ by far the largest incentive package given to a business to move to or stay in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. `` The total proposal that was worked out is extremely competitive with alternative sites,'' <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said. He said the <ORGANIZATION> Hoffman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estates </ORGANIZATION> parcel was selected from about 50 sites in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> area and other states. <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> estimates that building a campus-style facility in <ORGANIZATION> Hoffman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estates </ORGANIZATION> will cost $ 220 million. The Tribune and the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sun-Times </ORGANIZATION> said the deal was cemented Sunday after talks between Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> thanked <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> and legislative leaders for `` agreeing to support the pending legislation which has enabled us to make this decision.''

<HEAD>Magazine Says Needless Delays Hurting Work on Dead Sea Scrolls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An article published today in an archaeological review said an Israeli government timetable for scholarly work on the Dead Sea Scrolls is a `` hoax and a fraud'' that will delay publication of documents that may hold new insights on early Judaism and Christianity. One member of the scroll publication team, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> <PERSON> Cross </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Divinity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, conceded that publication of the documets is proceeding slowly but said the `` fraud'' charge in the magazine <ORGANIZATION> Biblical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archaeology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION> is `` certainly incorrect.'' The article by <PERSON> Hershel </PERSON> <PERSON> Shanks </PERSON>, editor of the review, said the team of scholars assigned to the task, originally by the government of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and later by the government of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, `` has now become more an obstacle to publication than a source of information.'' Shanks called for opening the materials to research by `` any scholar who so wishes.'' The article included a copy of the timetable published by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Antiquities </ORGANIZATION>, which calls for completion of the work by the end of 1996. `` It is a hoax and a fraud,'' <PERSON> Shanks </PERSON> wrote. `` It is not a timetable at all. It does n't specifiy what happens if the scholars do n't meet the timetable.'' Cross, reached by telephone in <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, said, `` The notion that the timetable is a fraud, if that is the way it is put, is certainly incorrect.'' `` Timetables in scholarly work often are not kept precisely,'' he said. `` They are sometimes beaten and they are sometimes delayed, but the term fraud is wrong.'' `` That the work has proceeded slowly is certainly true,'' <PERSON> Cross </PERSON> said. `` And this is, if you wish, the norm rather than something unusual in a find of this kind.'' The first of the Dead Sea Scrolls, a set of ancient Hebrew texts, were found in a cave in 1947. Some Biblical texts and a collection of laws, stories and poetry were published soon after their discovery. Even more of them, about 400 texts, have yet to be released. `` The problem with these materials is not generally recognized,'' <PERSON> Cross </PERSON> said. `` These are not scrolls which were found intact, the ones that have not been published, but are in literally hundreds of thousands of pieces.'' <PERSON> Shanks </PERSON> said some of the fragments `` are deteriorating so rapidly that if the outside world can not see them soon, it may never be able to see them.'' Cross, however, said that while the material is deteriorating it is `` simply untrue'' that the documents will be lost if not speedily published. `` The early photographs and the rephotographing that is going on now are the way this material will be preserved,'' he said. `` Publication is not going to add anything to the original negatives and the more recent ones.'' The best place for them, he said, would be in a dry place deep underground, like the caves in which they were preserved for centuries. But, he added, `` We ca n't rebury them.''

 A moderate earthquake hit <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Azores </LOCATION> islands today, causing panic and minor injuries, officials said. The quake shook the islands of <LOCATION> Pico </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Graciosa </PERSON> in the nine-island archipelago's central group, said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Azores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> vulcanology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> department </ORGANIZATION>. The islands are about 740 miles west of mainland <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>. The temblor's epicenter was to the north of <LOCATION> Graciosa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> island </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> said. The quake measured five to six on the Mercalli scale, which gauges the intensity of a quake as felt in a specific location on a scale of one for the weakest quake to 12 for the strongest. Island hospital officials were quoted by the <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> news agency <ORGANIZATION> Lusa </ORGANIZATION> as saying there were minor injuries. An employee at <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION> medical center, <PERSON> Graciosa </PERSON>, said a house collapsed but the center had admitted no casualties.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Commodores </ORGANIZATION>, a black American singing group, has canceled a July concert in <LOCATION> Sun </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> because of pressure from anti-apartheid groups, concert organizers said today. The South African <ORGANIZATION> Musicians </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> warned last week that it planned protests against the group's visit to <LOCATION> Sun </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, the capital of the nominally independent black homeland of <LOCATION> Bophuthatswana </LOCATION>. None of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s race discrimination laws apply in <LOCATION> Bophuthatswana </LOCATION>, but anti-apartheid advocates object to the homeland system that designates certain areas of the country for specific tribes. A <LOCATION> Sun </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> entertainment official said the musical group has since decided not to make the trip. `` This action restricts cultural freedom in the same way that apartheid abuses people's freedom of speech and choice,'' said <PERSON> Hazel </PERSON> <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON>, entertainment director of <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, which runs the hotel and entertainment complex at <LOCATION> Sun </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. She said 80 percent of 30,000 tickets sold for the July 7 concert were bought by blacks. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Commodores </ORGANIZATION>, who have won awards in the States for their commitment to the people by the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION>, were deeply sincere in their belief that their trip would bring joy to their thousands of fans, while focusing on their commitment to the abolition of apartheid,'' she said. Mrs. <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Commodores </ORGANIZATION>, whose hits include `` Night Shift'' and `` Three Times a Lady,'' plan to explain their action at a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> news conference on Wednesday. One member of the group, <ORGANIZATION> Milan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Williams </ORGANIZATION>, was quoted by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s Weekly Mail on Friday as saying he would not join the tour. At that time, the other three members of the group and a backing band still planned to come. <LOCATION> Sun </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s version of <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, is the most glamorous of the entertainment complexes in the homelands.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said today the battle against crime in the streets is also a struggle to end violence against women and to expand women's opportunities in the workplace. `` This war against women must stop,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> declared to cheers at a convention of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION>. Making a pitch for his anti-crime package, the president said, `` All too often, violent crime also means crime against women.'' `` I am angered and disgusted by the crimes against <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> women and by the archaic and unacceptable attitudes that all too frequently contribute to those crimes _ whether it involves spouse abuse at home, or violence in the streets,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` These are evil acts that transcend racial and class lines. This war against women must stop.'' He said it was `` just unthinkable'' that his seven grandaughters should not have the same opportunities in life as his four grandsons. `` No matter how equal the opportunities in our schools and workplace, women will never have the same opportunities as men if a climate of fear leaves them justificably concerned at walking to the campus library at night, or reluctant to work late hours for fear of getting out of some parking lot safely,'' the president said. `` Fundamentally, violence against women wo n't subside unless public attitudes change. We must continue to educate police and prosecutors, judges and juries, and we must engender a climate where the message our children get, in teleivison and films, from schools and parents, is that violence against women is wrong.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> received an honorary membership in the 140,000-member organization. `` Technically that makes me the first <ORGANIZATION> AAUW </ORGANIZATION> member to be president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, but I know I wo n't be the last,'' he said to more cheers. The <ORGANIZATION> AAUW </ORGANIZATION>, founded in 1881, promotes equal opportunity and advancement for women and girls at all levels of education. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was also meeting today with Japanese Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hiroshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitsuzuka </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Soares </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 Prospective homebuyers failed to take advantage of falling mortgage rates in May when sales of existing homes fell 5.6 percent to their lowest level in 16 months, a real estate trade group reported Monday. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION> said sales of single-family homes fell last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.21 million units, down from 3.4 million units in both March and April. The May resale rate was off 11.3 percent from a year ago, the Realtors said, and was the lowest since 3.2 million units were sold in January 1988. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said fixed-rate mortgage interest dropped from 10.97 percent the first week of May to 10.48 percent at the end of the month. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> recently relaxed slightly the grip it has held on the credit supply to restrain the economy and hold down inflation. <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> Vice Chairman <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> on Monday suggested the possiblity of a further interest rate decline when questioned about inflation after addressing the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shareholders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` Well, that's a never-ending process, the fight against inflation,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. `` So, I do n't think we can ever be totally confident. But, I think we are more optimistic about the upcoming period and I think conditions look pretty good.'' Nevertheless, Realtors President <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gribin </PERSON> said of the lag in response to May's falling intest rates: `` Buyers are not going to start flooding the markets the instant mortgage rates start to go down. It takes time for the tide to change.'' But <PERSON> Gribin </PERSON> suggested the pace of existing home sales will pick up in June as people begin to take advantage of lower mortgage rates. The Realtors said the median price of existing homes in May was $ 93,100, up $ 200 from April. The median is the point at which half of the homes sold for more and half for less. The decline in sales was sharpest in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, where there had been steady activity earlier this year. Sales were down 10.1 percent below April to a rate of 800,000 units. The West, which also had been largely unaffected by mortgage rates earlier this year, also posted a notable resale decline to 570,000 units, down 8.1 percent below the April rate. Sales of 590,000 units in the Northeast were 3.3 percent below April. Sales in the South dropped to 1.23 million units, down 3.9 percent from April.

 A report today that federal officials are underestimating the spread of AIDS raises questions about the nation's ability to cope with the crisis, say congressmen who are monitoring the epidemic. A General Accounting Office report says the number of AIDS cases expected to be diagnosed over the next three years has been undercounted by as much as one-third by the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>. `` The really frightening aspect of this report is it proves how little we know about the AIDS epidemic,'' Rep. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyden </PERSON>, D-Ore., said Sunday He and Reps. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich., and <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>, D-Calif., requested the `` When these projections of AIDS cases go awry, it undermines research, destroys the validity of our plans for taking care of AIDS victims and conveys a false sense of confidence to our fellow citizens that the AIDS epidemic is under control,'' <PERSON> Wyden </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>, in a report being released today, estimated that 300,000 to 480,000 Americans will have been diagnosed with AIDS by the end of 1991. This compares with <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>'s estimated range of 185,000 to 320,000 cases through 1991. `` The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> has done the best they could but they've been underfunded,'' <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Today'' show. `` We need a new survey in this country about <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> sexual patterns, which we have n't had for 40 years.'' `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has the best AIDS reporting system in the world,'' Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, assistant secretary of health and former director of the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>, said on the same show. `` That's why more than 60 percent of the cases reported in the world have been reported by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. ... We can always do better, however.'' Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> today announced approval of a drug to treat an eye infection in AIDS patients that can lead to blindness. It is the fourth drug to be approved for treatment of AIDS or an AIDS-related condition. The drug, ganciclovir, has been widely available for several months to AIDS patients with the eye infection, cytomegalovirus retinitis, under a special <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> category called `` treatment IND'' that allows distribution of promising drugs to the gravely ill while safety and effectiveness research continues. About 20 percent of AIDS patients develop the eye infection. <ORGANIZATION> Syntex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Palo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, will market the drug under the name Cytovene. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> also announced `` treatment IND'' status for an experimental protein, r-erythropoietin, to treat severe anemia that weakens nearly half of the 20,000 patients taking the anti-viral drug AZT. <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said the two actions reflect the agency's commitment to getting promising new drugs to AIDS victims quickly. He said that while there still is no cure for the disease, these two drugs and others recently approved for commercial release and treatment INDs can extend and improve the lives of AIDS patients, making early diagnosis more important. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> evaluated 13 national forecasts of the cumulative number of AIDS cases through the end of 1991 and found a range of predictions from 85,000 to 750,000 cases. The report looked only at the number of potential AIDS cases, not the number of people who test positive for the AIDS-causing human immunodeficiency virus but show no symptoms of AIDS. Projections of the spread of acquired immune deficiency syndrome are important because they are used in deciding how much money is spent on AIDS education, research projects and public health care services for AIDS patients. Also, if faulty forecasting is underestimating the heterosexual spread of AIDS, as the report concludes, the result `` may be luring a significant number of Americans into a false sense of security,'' <PERSON> Wyden </PERSON> said. Sunday editions of The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> officials acknowledged serious underreporting of AIDS cases but said <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> projections were too high. The report blamed the undercounting on a variety of factors, including the absence of data on the size of risk groups, the definition of what constitutes an AIDS case, reliance on incomplete surveillance data, and the undercounting of heterosexuals at risk. The report said <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> must get more up-to-date and accurate information about the risk groups if it hopes to improve its projections. Earlir this month, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> study also said <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> may be significantly underestimating the number of Americans with AIDS. The study attributed some of the undercounting to affluent victims who are treated discreetly by physicians who do not report cases of the disease. AIDS is spread by close contact with blood, blood products or semen from infected people. Its chief victims are homosexual men and intravenous drug users. As of May 31, 1989, AIDS had been diagnosed in 97,193 Americans, of whom more than half, or 56,468, have died since June 1, 1981, according to the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>. No one is known to have recovered from AIDS.

 The 420,000 gallons of oil spilled from a tanker off <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> had largely dispersed or evaporated by this morning, officials said. Hundreds of people worked to clean up spills in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Things were `` much, much better than yesterday,'' <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morin </PERSON>, a state environmental official, said after flying over the stricken <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prodigy </ORGANIZATION>, which ran aground on a reef Friday at the mouth of <LOCATION> Narragansett </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, officials also were optimistic, saying the much heavier oil spilled in the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> on Saturday was so congealed in the cool water that shoreline damage was minimal. Workers used rakes to remove football-size, tar-like gobs from the river, where up to 800,000 gallons spilled. As a tropical storm approached <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, crews there brought in `` supersucker'' vacuums to clean up a 250,000-gallon spill near <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Morin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> director of groundwater and wetlands, said he and other officials flew more than 14 miles offshore and found only one small patch of oil about four miles out that he said was unlikely to reach shore. `` I have n't seen it anywhere on the beaches we've flown today,'' he said. Nevertheless, Gov. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> DiPrete </PERSON> ordered beaches to remain closed today, and a ban on shellfishing remained in effect. Since lobsters, flounders, cod and haddock _ important to the region's fishing industry _ are now laying eggs, it is the worst possible time for an oil spill, said <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Fish can swim away from the slick, but larvae do n't have that mobility, he said. <PERSON> DiPrete </PERSON> said the captain of the Greek-licensed World Prodigy, <PERSON> Iakovis </PERSON> <PERSON> Georgudis </PERSON>, admitted he failed to wait for a pilot and mistakenly changed course, sending the ship toward rocks. Hours after the accident, a tanker and an oil barge collided in the <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> Ship Channel that connects the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> city with <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, causing a spill. And early Saturday, heavy oil spilled in the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> after an Uruguayan tanker ran aground. Results of drug tests on <PERSON> Georgudis </PERSON> and a mate whose name was not immediately available were expected by late today, although the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said drugs or alcohol were not believed to have been factors in the accident. The crewmen's urine samples were mishandled, reportedly through improper refrigeration, and new ones had to be taken 19 hours after the accident, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said. A federal inquiry will be convened Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Adm. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rybacki </PERSON> said. State Attorney General <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neil </PERSON> said he hopes to learn if <PERSON> Georgudis </PERSON> violated state law by approaching too near the bay without a pilot. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> reduced its estimate of the amount of oil spilled to 420,000 gallons. Earlier estimates were as high as 1.6 million. About 200 National Guardsmen, 120 prison inmates and 200 volunteers fought the oil. The oil spread rapidly over nearly 30 square miles. At one point, it threatened <LOCATION> Block </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, a fashionable vacation spot, but this morning officials said that worry had ebbed because the oil was evaporating rapidly. `` You're reaching the point where you're running out of molecules that can go anywhere,'' said a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, Chief Warrant Officer <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Meidt </PERSON>. Most of <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>'s beaches reopened Sunday after overnight winds pushed the oil offshore, but the governor today closed beaches nearly to <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>. Elsewhere, contractors in the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> hired 255 employees, and <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> agreed to provide 300 National Guardsmen to help remove the heavy fuel oil floating in globs and occasionally washing ashore in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. Federal officials said this morning that shoreline damage was minimal. Coast Guard Capt. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Murdock </PERSON> said there wo n't be much of a problem unless the oil was somehow warmed to 95 degrees or higher and liquified. The tanker, refloated Sunday, was carrying 18 million gallons of heating oil. Officials said that they were unable to account for at least 800,000 gallons but that the actual spill was probably less. Shoreline contamination was reported from <LOCATION> Ridley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Castle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Del. </LOCATION>, about 30 miles to the south. Wildlife officials worked to protect <LOCATION> Pea </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Patch </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, home to several species of nesting shorebirds. Crews laid 1,700 feet of oil-retaining booms along the island, one of the mid-Atlantic's largest rookeries One oil-covered duckling died, but the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said wildlife deaths would probably be limited because the oil is so thick it wo n't easily smear onto animals' bodies. `` These are important nursing grounds and this is an important time of year,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Malone </PERSON>, acting head of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estuarine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, crews aided by wind and waves from the approach of Tropical Storm <PERSON> Allison </PERSON> used seven huge vacuum machines to try to pick up the oil. By this morning, about a third of the oil had been sucked from the <LOCATION> Bayport </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Channel </LOCATION>, where the oil was flowing, said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Morehead </PERSON>. `` They're stepping up their cleanup efforts to try to get it out before the storm comes in,'' <PERSON> Morehead </PERSON> said. The Coast Guard scheduled a hearing on Tuesday to investigate Friday's collision of the tanker Rachel-B and a barge owned by <ORGANIZATION> Coastal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Towing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Court to Use Ohio Case to Rule on Outlawing Child Nudity Material</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, setting the stage for an important child pornography ruling, said today it will decide whether states may outlaw possession of `` lewd'' material depicting child nudity. The court said it will use an <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> case to explore how far states may go to protect children without violating freedom of expression. The justices ruled in 1982 that states may outlaw material depicting sexual performances by children. But that ruling stopped short of banning mere possession of `` kiddie porn.'' That ruling was aimed at such activities as photographing minors in lewd poses or promoting or distributing the material. In the case acted on today, the court will hear arguments during its 1989-90 term beginning in October, with a ruling not expected until sometime in 1990. The case stems from the prosecution of <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Osborne </PERSON>, 61, of <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, who was sentenced to six months in jail for possessing four photos of a nude boy. Prosecutors said he got the photos from a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> mail-order business and had placed them in a photo album in his home. <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> police searched his home in July 1985 after being told by a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> postal inspector that two people arrested there said <PERSON> Osborne </PERSON> had bought photos of nude boys. The <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> last July upheld the state law against possessing child pornography. The law makes exceptions for parents or guardians of a child or for material that serves a `` bona fide artistic, religious, governmental, judicial or other proper purpose.'' The state court rejected arguments that the law is too vague or that someone can be convicted under it without realizing he or she is committing a crime. `` We have no difficulty finding that the jury would have believed beyond a reasonable doubt that -LRB- <PERSON> Osborne </PERSON> -RRB- was aware of the nature of the photographs,'' the state court said. An anticipated <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> showdown over possession of child pornography fizzled last Wednesday when the justices sent a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> case back to that state's courts for further action. The case acted on today is <PERSON> Osborne </PERSON> vs. <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, 88-5986.

<TEXT>
 A committee of journalists reprimanded columnist <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> on Monday for his `` role in bringing a gun into the Capitol'' for a television show on terrorism but did not revoke his press credentials. He rejected the reprimand. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> has said he engineered the plan to smuggle the gun into the Capitol last month to show a need for better security. He did not carry in the gun himself. `` We believe that you abused your privilege as a credentialed member of the daily press gallery, and needlessly jeopardized the relationship reporters have with the Capitol police,'' <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Birnbaum </PERSON>, of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>, wrote in a letter to <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>. He said the five-member committee, which provides credentials to reporters who cover <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, `` has voted unanimously to reprimand you for your role in bringing a gun into the Capitol last month.'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> responded with his own letter, saying: `` With no disrepect intended, I must reject the reprimand of the standing committee.'' He said he knew that several terrorist leaders were planning to make the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> their target and that the political leaders would be in danger. `` I'm appalled that the congressional leaders whose lives I wanted to protect seem less concerned about the threat to their security than the political embarrassment I apparently caused them.'' During an interview May 24 with Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., in <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s private office, <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> pulled from his pocket a gun that had been concealed in his televison crew's The incident occurred during taping for a segment of his TV program and <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> claimed it was to demonstrate security breaches in the building. But it is a felony to bring a firearm onto the Capitol grounds or into any of the buildings, and Capitol police and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney are investigating whether to press charges against <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, said officer <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON>. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Standing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correspondents </ORGANIZATION> he would not be at their meeting unless <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, the minority leader, were there. They did not appear, though they had initiated the action by asking <PERSON> Birnbaum </PERSON> in a June 6 letter to `` review this serious incident and take sufficient action to deter any future repetition of this act.'' The committee, whose leaders are elected by journalists, was established by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to decide who should work in the press galleries and to allocate space in the galleries. Along with sending a letter of reprimand to <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, the committee voted to revise its regulations so that any credentialed member who disobeys security rules in the future would be subject to suspension. `` When you used your position as a reporter to have a weapon brought into the Capitol, and then produced it in the office of Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> on May 24, you violated the trust that our extension of the credential to you implies,'' said <PERSON> Birnbaum </PERSON>'s letter to <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>. `` Therefore we admonish you in the strongest terms.''

 The government will ban versions of the Koran using Roman script, allowing only those in <PERSON> Jawi </PERSON> and Arabic scripts, an official said Monday. <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamid </PERSON> <PERSON> Othman </PERSON>, director general of the Islamic Affairs Division in the prime minister's department, said the ban would take effect in about six months. Under the ban, anyone possessing the Koran in Roman script could be imprisoned for up to three years or fined about $ 1,850, he said. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fatwa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which rules on Islamic matters, decided to impose the ban, because the Roman version did not give proper pronunciations. The <PERSON> Jawi </PERSON> script looks like Arabic or <LOCATION> Urdu </LOCATION> script. Islam is <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>'s official religion and about half of its 17 million people are Moslems. The others are mainly Buddhists, Hindus and Christians.

 Re-enactments staged on the great battlefields of the Civil War usually end the same way _ with boys in blue routing the Confederate gray. But not so in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> this summer. At <LOCATION> Vicksburg </LOCATION>, cannons will boom and muskets flash over the Fourth of July weekend to commemorate a clear-cut <ORGANIZATION> Confederate </ORGANIZATION> victory over <ORGANIZATION> Yankee </ORGANIZATION> troops when Gen. <PERSON> Ulysses </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> made his first major attempt to silence the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> fortress 126 years ago. And at <ORGANIZATION> Brice </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roads </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, scene of a textbook attack by Confederate Gen. <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bedford </PERSON> <PERSON> Forrest </PERSON>'s cavalry, historians recently replaced 99 markers to unknown Southern dead with 102 stones bearing the names of Rebel soldiers known to have been killed in the June 10, 1864, battle. The <LOCATION> Vicksburg </LOCATION> artillery demonstrations and engagements by several hundred re-enactors will take place Saturday and Sunday on private land in <LOCATION> Vicksburg </LOCATION> where the actual engagement being commemorated occurred on May 22, 1863. <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>'s all-out attack was beaten back by the <LOCATION> Vicksburg </LOCATION> garrison during a one-day battle that resulted in 3,000 Union soldiers killed or wounded. The Confederates suffered about 500 casualties. Realizing a direct attack would be too costly, <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> encircled the city on land and water, starving the garrison into surrender 47 days later on July 4, 1863. `` Last year was the first year we had a re-enactment at <LOCATION> Vicksburg </LOCATION> and, since it was the 125th anniversary of the siege, we felt it only appropriate to do the last few days of it, including the surrender,'' said <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Cotton </PERSON>, director of the Old Court House Museum and organizer of the `` Vicksburg Civil War Re-enactment.'' `` We did not realize when we planned last year's event that re-living those days would be so emotionally straining on everyone here,'' said Cotton. `` This year, the re-enactors wanted to do something different, something very dramatic and we did n't want to go through another defeat,'' he said. `` So this battle was the obvious choice.'' Across the state in <LOCATION> Lee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, history buff <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> and his associates found another way to remember a Confederate victory. `` Up to this point, all the battlefields I have marked were of Confederate defeats,'' said <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, a department head at <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Perkinston </LOCATION> campus and <ORGANIZATION> Confederate </ORGANIZATION> graves registrar in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> for the Sons of Confederate Veterans. `` This time it was different.'' At the <ORGANIZATION> Brice </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roads </ORGANIZATION> battlefield, about six miles west of <LOCATION> Baldwyn </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Forrest </PERSON> won a major tactical victory over Gen. S.D. <PERSON> Sturgis </PERSON>' larger Union force. When the fighting ended, over 1,500 Union soldiers had been captured. `` For <PERSON> Forrest </PERSON>, it was a textbook battle that has been studied at war colleges around the world,'' said <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, who will participate in the re-enactment at <LOCATION> Vicksburg </LOCATION>. `` Many believe this was his greatest victory for, heavily outnumbered, he was able to destroy the federal cavalry first and then the infantry.'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said the markers to the unknown dead were placed at the battle site sometime after 1930, following passage of a federal law allowing military stones for fallen Confederates. `` Thanks to the research of a friend named <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON>, who has a network of colleagues throughout the country who trade information on Confederate dead, we were able to identify 102 men killed at the crossroads on the Confederate side.'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said the new markers were arranged in alphabetical order `` because we know they were placed in a burial pit but we do not know exactly where each body was situated.''

 <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON>'s lawyer asked a judge today to throw out a lawsuit accusing the heartthrob actor of videotaping a teen-age girl during a sex act. <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Neely </PERSON> told <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Tidwell </PERSON> that the girl's mother, who brought the suit, has no legal standing to sue under a <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> law that allows parents to seek damages over the seduction of an minor child. The judge did not indicate when he would rule. <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON>, 25, is accused of making the sexually explicit tape of <PERSON> Lena </PERSON> <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Parsons </PERSON>, then 16, and another woman in his hotel suite during last summer's Democratic National Convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. The suit was filed May 12 by <PERSON> Lena </PERSON> <PERSON> Arlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, the girl's mother, who is seeking unspecified damages. <PERSON> Neely </PERSON> argued today that even if the allegations were true, the seduction law is probably unconstitutional, Ms. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> is not the girl's custodial parent as required by law and the woman suffered no direct emotional harm. Ms. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> does not live with her daughter, <PERSON> Neely </PERSON> said. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hue </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON>, Ms. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s lawyer, argued that <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> seduced <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Parsons </PERSON> and that Ms. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> has suffered direct harm. `` One could see how a parent could and would suffer extreme emotional distress'' from seeing such a tape, he said. `` This is a case of wanton, willful, intentional misconduct.'' <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> did not attend the hearing. Those who have seen the tape _ and they are legion _ do n't seem to question that they are seeing the face and hearing the voice of the star of such films as `` St. Elmo's Fire,'' and `` About Last Night.'' <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s TV stations have run excerpts, over and over and over, with little shadowy boxes blocking out the participants' private parts. The city's alternative weekly, Creative Loafing, reviewed the tapes as cinema verite. Rock satirist <PERSON> Mojo </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, in a recent <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> concert, reworked several of his songs to include verses about the scandal, led his audience in chants of `` Oh, no! <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON>!'' and asked _ apparently seriously _ if anyone knew where he could see the tapes for himself. Doubtlessly, someone in the audience did. The tapes have been passed around the city's club and party circuit _ not to mention the journalism community _ so much that bragging about having seen them is now out of fashion. In court papers, <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> denied he `` committed any wrongful acts giving rise to liability.'' <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON>'s attorneys also have filed papers accusing Ms. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> of using `` extortionist tactics'' to force <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> to pay as much as $ 500,000 to avoid bad publicity. They also accused Ms. <PERSON> Parsons </PERSON> of helping circulate the tape. `` I knew they would resort to desperate tactics at some point,'' <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> responded. `` I expected them to sling all kinds of mud because their client is the one on film in compromising positions, and there is no way they can avoid that fact.'' <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> said Ms. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> rejected a $ 35,000 `` take-it-or-leave-it'' offer from <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON>'s attorneys in February, but he denied making any $ 500,000 settlement demands. The videotape that has circulated shows the man believed to be <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> in a room with Ms. <PERSON> Parsons </PERSON> and another woman. It shows the teen-ager having sex with the woman, with `` Lowe'' heard and seen giving directions like a movie directr, but it does not show intercourse between the actor and Ms. <PERSON> Parsons </PERSON>. A different segment of the tape, apparently taken at a different time, allegedly shows <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> having sex with others. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> has charged in court papers that <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> also had sex with Miss <PERSON> Parsons </PERSON> while watched by an unidentified female. The <LOCATION> Fulton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> district attorney's office said <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> is under investigation on possible charges of sexual exploitation of a minor, which carries up to 20 years in prison.

 Workers cleaning up a <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> oil spill of up to 800,000 gallons used rakes and even their hands this morning to pick up gobs of oil so big and heavy they jammed skimming machinery. The oil came from a Uruguayan tanker that ran aground near here early Saturday just south of the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> line. The spill came less than 24 hours after big spills in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. The cause of the accident was under investigation. Officials said that the congealed oil is difficult to clean up but has caused little damage to the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> coast because the gobs tend to bounce along the shoreline rather than spread out. The brownish blobs range in size from a football to 2 feet or more and have the consistency of roofing tar, said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Woods </PERSON>. They're so gooey they can be picked up by hand. Coast Guard Petty Officer <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Oney </PERSON> said the oil will have little effect on wildlife. `` It is so solidified, fish can swim around it and a bird would have to fly right into it to get hurt,'' he said. Officials said they could not account for at least 800,000 gallons from the tanker, which was carrying 18 million gallons of refined industrial heating oil. But they said it is doubtful the full amount is in the water, and there is no sign much of it has sunk to the bottom of the river. The cleanup ran into problems because skimmers called in were unable to deal with blobs floating in the water. Instead, the blobs were pushed toward shore with booms and then raked in. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Gartin </PERSON> of J & amp; J Spill Service of <LOCATION> Norristown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, manager of the cleanup, said the job would probably take more than a week. Globs of oil have been spotted as far north as <LOCATION> Ridley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>; and as far south as <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Castle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Del. </LOCATION>, about 30 miles downstream. Some oil has also washed onto the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> side of the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. The Presidente <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> was refloated Sunday and taken to its original destination, the <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> refinery in nearby <LOCATION> Marcus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hook </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, where most of the remaining oil was loaded into storage tanks. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said that the ship was owned by the Uruguayan government, which is assuming full financial responsibility for the spill. <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> wildlife officials worked to protect <LOCATION> Pea </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Patch </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, in the river south of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Castle </LOCATION>, which is home to several species of nesting shorebirds. Crews laid 1,700 feet of oil-retaining booms along the island. <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, said that because of the weather, water conditions and oil consistency, the fuel is not breaking up. `` The water is n't particularly choppy and there is n't much heavy wave action, so the oil moves back and forth with the tide,'' he said. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said cleanup contractors have hired more than 250 temporary employees and the state of <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> has agreed to send 300 National Guardsmen. `` The system will be operating tomorrow at the maximum capacity possible,'' he said Sunday. `` As we have never done this type of operation before, it will take some time to gear up.'' Coast Guard Lt. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Weakley </PERSON> and Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Castle </PERSON> said they were unable to confirm reports of a mechanical problem aboard the ship. Drug and alcohol tests were performed on all personnel involved in navigating the ship. The results were not immediately available.

 Hundreds of white-robed Israeli Moslems crossed this army checkpoint Monday for the annual pilgrimage to <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials urged them to help mediate between the Jewish state and its Arab neighbors. `` There has been a lot of hatred, mistrust and enmity,'' Cabinet member <PERSON> Ehud </PERSON> <PERSON> Olmert </PERSON> said at a ceremony marking the pilgrims' crossing the bridge to <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> for the trip to <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>. `` You can serve as a bridge'' between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on the one side, and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> states and Palestinians on the other, said <PERSON> Olmert </PERSON>, the prime minister's adviser on <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> affairs. But some of the 5,400 Israeli Arabs pilgrims said they identified more with the Palestinians' 18-month uprising in the occupied lands than with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` We are proud of the uprising. It has given us more respect outside,'' said <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Nuseirat </PERSON>, 42, of the northern Israeli village of <LOCATION> Taibeh </LOCATION>. `` We have deep ties to the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> in the occupied territories. It's religion that binds us together, and we are all members of the same nation,'' Nuseirat said. There are 810,000 Israeli Arab citizens, from families who remained in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> when the Jewish state was founded in 1948. About 1.7 million Palestinians live in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, including those who fled <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in 1948 and residents of the occupied lands before they were captured in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. Nuseirat and about 1,400 other Israeli Arab pilgrims, most in white robes and white prayer caps, sat in two dozen buses waiting for a last security check before crossing the <LOCATION> Allenby </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> into <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. Women wearing white scarves repacked their belongings after searches by soldiers, reassembling bed rolls and plastic shopping baskets filled with rice, sugar, olives, coffee and tea. About 5,400 Israeli Arabs, up about 400 from last year, are leaving for Mecca via <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> this week. They are scheduled to return by July 21. Mecca is Islam's holiest site, and making the hajj, or pilgrimage, is one of the chief religious duties of Moslems. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, both technically at war with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, first permitted Israeli Arabs to join the hajj in 1977. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> limits the number of pilgrims, and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> only gives exit permits to Moslems who are 30 years of age or older, citing security reasons. `` We are angry about this. In our religion, there is no such thing as an age limit,'' said <PERSON> Yehiah </PERSON> <PERSON> Haj </PERSON>, 31, also of <LOCATION> Taibeh </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Haj </PERSON> made his first pilgrimage last year and said Israeli Arabs attract much attention in <LOCATION> Saudia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>. `` When we say where we are from, people gather around. They want to know what's going on in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' he said.

 The first tropical storm of the season developed in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> this morning, bringing heavy rain and flooding to the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> coast. The National Hurricane Center in <LOCATION> Coral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gables </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, upgraded a slow-moving tropical depression to a storm about 7 a.m. after its sustained winds reached 39 mph. By late morning, Tropical Storm <PERSON> Allison </PERSON> had sustained near 50 mph with gusts to 65 mph, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. It was moving north about 5 mph and was southwest of <LOCATION> Freeport </LOCATION>, about 55 miles south of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. A voluntary evacuation was issued for <LOCATION> Quintana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, a small island community of about 150 south of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. Sheriff's deputies went door-to-door telling residents that rising waters could close the bridge to the mainland. `` We're telling them if they want to get out, they'd better get out now,'' Chief Deputy <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> said. Tides in <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION> were about three feet above normal. `` There probably will be some minor wind damage. The main thing is the rain. It's a heavy rainmaker,'' <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> meteorologist <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Vannozzi </PERSON> said. A tropical storm warning was issued from <ORGANIZATION> Freeport </ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION> Morgan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La </LOCATION>. There were reports of flooding south of <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Matagorda </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Brazoria </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>If All Aid Requests Honored, Deficit Could Triple: Yeutter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said Monday that the federal deficit would double or triple if all requests for farm aid were honored. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>, speaking at a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said about 75 percent of his mail comes from people asking for more government assistance of some kind. `` Most of these letters are coming from members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, of course, reflecting concerns of their constitutents,'' he said. `` If the government were to honor all of those pleas for additional funding, that ... $ 150 billion deficit that we have now would probably double or treble, just based on agricultural requests alone, aside from what the rest of the economy is asking for.'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said there are many views as to whether American farmers have become addicted to federal subsidies. He said his home state of <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> last year had a net farm income of `` something over $ 2 billion,'' of which more than $ 1 billion came from the government. `` That's pretty addictive,'' he said.

 Nobody loves family reunions more than jazz people. And what more joyous reunion could there be than that of singer <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> and the Count Basie Orchestra. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> became a star when he joined the Basie band in the mid-1950s. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' 1955 recording with the band of `` Every Day I Have the Blues'' made him internationally known. Eventually, in 1961, he struck out on his own and has had continued success. His 70th birthday seemed like a natural occasion for a `` reunion'' with the Basie bunch, led these days by saxophonist <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON>. It also made for a splendid opening night Friday of the <ORGANIZATION> JVC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jazz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Festival </ORGANIZATION>, which first came to town 18 years ago as the <ORGANIZATION> Newport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jazz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Festival </ORGANIZATION>. It has changed sponsors and names a few times, but it's still a premiere jazz bash. <ORGANIZATION> JVC </ORGANIZATION> is the <ORGANIZATION> Japanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Victor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, an electronics firm. The Carnegie Hall concert showed why <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> has endured. His voice ranges from a whisper to a shout, as comfortable with gospel and ballad standards as with the lowdown blues. The first half of the concert, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> and his trio, led by pianist <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>, explored the singer's range. Ballads alternated with some shouters' favorites; `` Embraceable You,'' for example, followed by `` All Right, OK, You Win.'' Several duets with <PERSON> Marlena </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> ended the all-Williams part of the evening. After the intermission, the 16-piece Basie band, spurred on at times by dervish-like drummer <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, drove up the tempo. The orchestra performed a memorable `` Count Basie Remembrance Suite'' in honor of its jaunty founder. <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON>, the band's vocalist, sang a powerful and exciting `` Young and Foolish.'' Then came the highlight the audience had been waiting for. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> came back on stage and shouted several blues songs, his voice welling up to match the power of the Basie bunch. Happy birthday, <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, and many more. _ By <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillen </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 A federal jury today convicted five men of forming a Mafia faction that shot to death a mob-linked businessman in a restaurant and plotted to kill <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gotti </PERSON>, reputed boss of a rival crime family. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Alito </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> called the defendants `` among the most powerful organized crime figures in the state'' and said the verdict was a `` tremendous blow to organized crime in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>.'' The five could receive at least 50 years in prison at sentencing Aug. 3. Louis A. `` Bobby'' Manna, a reputed consigliere, or No. 3 leader, of the Genovese crime family, was convicted of conspiracy, racketeering, planning to kill <PERSON> Gotti </PERSON> and arranging the murder of businessman <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Schiff </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gotti </PERSON>, reputed boss of the <PERSON> Gambino </PERSON> family, was a target because of a turf battle, authorities said. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> tipped <PERSON> Gotti </PERSON> to the plot, which was not carried out. The 350-pound, free-spending <PERSON> Schiff </PERSON> was shot to death in 1987 over dessert at a restaurant on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION>. His dinner companion, identified in news reports then only as a `` mysterious blonde'' who fled the scene, was revealed in court as <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Galip </PERSON>. She testified that a masked man fired two shots into <PERSON> Schiff </PERSON>'s head. Prosecutors said <PERSON> Schiff </PERSON> may have threatened to expose Genovese activity or could no longer be trusted with a $ 25 million to $ 40 million mob money-laundering operation. Also convicted were <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> A. `` Motts'' <PERSON> Casella </PERSON>, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> `` Bocci'' DeSciscio, union official <PERSON> Rocco </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoli </PERSON> and former <LOCATION> Hoboken </LOCATION> police Lt. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> `` Dipsy'' <PERSON> Daniello </PERSON>. <PERSON> Daniello </PERSON> was convicted in the conspiracy to kill <PERSON> Gotti </PERSON>.

 An `` underground railroad'' run by activists in this British colony has helped two student leaders and two dissident intellectuals escape a bloody crackdown in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, sources said Monday. Students Wu'er <PERSON> Kaixi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Lu </PERSON> and intellectuals <PERSON> Wan </PERSON> <PERSON> Runnan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Yan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jiaqi </PERSON> have escaped certain imprisonment and possible death and are now in the West, sources said. They said Wu'er escaped with his girlfriend, <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yan </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Yan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jiaqi </PERSON> fled with his wife, <PERSON> Gao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ao </PERSON>, and that at least a dozen other participants in the movement for freedom also have been smuggled to safety. The four men made it out of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> despite the crackdown on dissent and a nationwide manhunt during which their pictures were posted in airports and train stations, and border security was tightened. Three sources _ a diplomat who specializes in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> activist and a student _ spoke to <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on condition of anonymity and refused to divulge details of the escapes, saying they did not want to jeopardize efforts to smuggle more dissidents from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The crackdown began on June 3-4, when thousands of soldiers gunned down hundreds of unarmed citizens in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. Since then, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has arrested 1,800 people involved in the freedom movement and executed 27. Student leaders and dissidents have gone underground to avoid detention. Wu'er, a freshman at <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Normal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Li </PERSON>, a junior at <ORGANIZATION> Nanjing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, are on the wanted list of 21 students sought by <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> authorities for leading the movement. Five on the list have been arrested. A member of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s Turkish minority, Wu'er was famed for his compelling speeches for democracy and a nationally televised shouting match with Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>. On Monday night, a statement said to have been written by Wu'er while fleeing police was obtained by the AP. `` A black sun has appeared in the sky of my motherland and republic,'' said the statement, which appeared to be written in Wu'er's hand. `` Under this black sun, on a day in June that should have belonged to a season of fresh flowers, my people, my countrymen, my classmates and my beloved comrades-in-arms fell,'' it said, in a reference to the June 4 killing of unarmed citizens by the Chinese army in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. `` But our life is young, stubborn and uncrushable. What's more in my motherland ... these fresh flowers will one day open proudly under a red sky.'' `` Black sun, I'm going to shoot you down!'' The diplomatic source said the intellectual dissidents Wan and <PERSON> Yan </PERSON> were smuggled to the West through <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> last week. The two are on a wanted list of seven intellectuals issued by <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> authorities as part of the crackdown. So far, two if the seven apparently have been arrested. <PERSON> Yan </PERSON> has gone to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Wan </PERSON> <PERSON> Runnan </PERSON> has left for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the activist source said, declining to provide further details. Last week, dissident intellectual Su <PERSON> Shaozhi </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> after escaping <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> via <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION>. He was not aided by activists in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. While in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, Wan, general manager of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s first private high-technology company, the <ORGANIZATION> Stone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, had called for a meeting of the national congress to discuss student demands for a freer and less-corrupt society. He also was at the forefront of a movement to reform <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s constitution <PERSON> Yan </PERSON> was a leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intellectuals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which played an important role in the movement and was banned by the Chinese government when martial law was declared May 20. The activist released a statement by <PERSON> Yan </PERSON>, after he left <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, in which he blasted <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>, Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Shangkun </PERSON>, who have masterminded the crackdown. `` <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s political situation today is in the midst of a white terror,'' the statement said. The three leaders were `` using the inhuman policies of fascism to take all of those who support democracy, the real <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> people, and wipe out the whole lot,'' it said. These policies `` have not only intensified the people's desire for revenge and planted the seeds of democracy and freedom in the hearts of more and more people, they also have hastened their demise,'' he said The activist said more than a dozen people have been smuggled out of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> since the crackdown began. Most were from <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, but several student leaders from <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> also have escaped.

<HEAD>Binder Twins Far From Normal Two Years After Surgery</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Nearly two years after surgeons separated a pair of West German Siamese twins connected at the head, the children remain far from normal, doctors say. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Binder </PERSON> remains in `` a vegetative state,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Johns </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> Children's Center pediatric anesthesiologist who participated in the surgery and now directs the hospital's pediatric intensive care unit. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON>, is improving, but is `` clearly not normal and developmentally delayed,'' the doctor was quoted as saying in Monday's editions of The -LRB- <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> -RRB- Sun. The 22-hour surgery to separate the then 7-month-old twins finished Sept. 6, 1987. Hospital officials originally predicted a six-week recovery period, but the twins remained at Hopkins for more than seven months. When they returned to their home in <LOCATION> Ulm </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, in April 1988, <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> was hospitalized again. `` In a technological ` star wars' sort of way, the operation was a fantastic success,'' said <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Carson </PERSON>, the pediatric neurosurgeon who helped direct the surgical team. `` But as far as having normal children, I do n't think it was all that successful.'' The parents, <PERSON> Theresia </PERSON> and <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Binder </PERSON>, signed a contract with the West German magazine <ORGANIZATION> Bunte </ORGANIZATION>, giving the magazine exclusive rights to the story until the boys reach age 18.

 An 11-year-old Californian flew his single-engine plane into <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Monday after collecting signatures of nearly 1,000 Soviet children to present to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` It was n't a difficult flight. It's just like flying anywhere,'' <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Aliengena </PERSON> said as he made the second Soviet stop in his attempt to become the youngest person to pilot a plane around the globe. He landed his blue and white Cessna 210 at <LOCATION> Sheremetevo </LOCATION> airport after a two-hour flight from <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>, where he collected 987 signatures for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s scroll. In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, the fourth-grader was welcomed by <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pioneers </ORGANIZATION>, members of a <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> youth group who offered the traditional Russian bread and salt. After the youngster taxied to the terminal, he was surrounded by the youths, journalists and about 10 curious <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION> pilots. The young pilot, who has logged about 1,000 hours of flying time, will spend five days in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Among his stops will be Red Square, where West German teen-ager <PERSON> Mathias </PERSON> <PERSON> Rust </PERSON> gained worldwide fame by landing a single-engine <ORGANIZATION> Cessna </ORGANIZATION> in May 1987 after evading Soviet air defenses. Rust was convicted of illegally entering the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and other crimes and released after spending nearly a year of a four-year prison sentence. The young American brought a friendship scroll signed by 250,000 <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> children to present to President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, but it is not certain the Soviet leader will have time to meet him before he takes off Friday on a hopscotch journey across the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and on to <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. `` I am not sure if I will get to meet him, but I sure want to,'' the young pilot said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> already has agreed to meet him when he completes the journey scheduled to take 47 days and 19,000 miles around the world in short hops averaging three hours. The youth from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Capistrano </LOCATION> began his global flight June 5 from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. While flying in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, he is accompanied by a Soviet navigator because air controllers on many domestic routes do not speak English, as required on international routes.

<HEAD>Prime Minister Promises Reform After By-election Loss</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Prime Minister <PERSON> Sousuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> promised political reforms Monday following a by-election loss by his <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which has been shaken by scandal after nearly 35 years in power. <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> also acknowledged that reports of his having kept a mistress had caused problems for his personal leadership of the party and government. On Sunday, <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> candidate <PERSON> Kinuko </PERSON> <PERSON> Ofuchi </PERSON> won a seat in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>'s upper house in the by-election in <LOCATION> Niigata </LOCATION>, northern <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. A Socialist had held the seat, but the district traditionally has been conservative. `` I never expected that we would lose so badly,'' Uno said Monday. Press reports suggested voters were influenced by allegations that <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> paid a geisha to be his mistress for four months in 1985. At a news conference Monday, the prime minister said: `` I'm not in a position to comment.'' He said a new 3 percent sales tax, the Recruit influence-buying scandal and and farm issues were major factors in the loss at <LOCATION> Niigata </LOCATION>. Uno has refused comment on the reports of a mistress, calling it a private matter. `` I have respected political ethics for 30 years and I have not done anything unethical,'' he said Monday, but added: `` I think it is regrettable that I caused trouble'' through personal matters. A weekly magazine published the initial report about the geisha, without naming her. After the polls closed Sunday night, former geisha <PERSON> Mitsuko </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakanishi </PERSON>, 40, said in a national television interview she was the woman. She said Uno paid more than 3 million yen -LRB- about $ 21,430 -RRB- to her and her geisha house so she would be his mistress. The case has tarnished the `` clean'' reputation that led to <PERSON> Uno </PERSON>'s selection as prime minister a month ago His predecessor, <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, resigned to take responsibility for the Recruit scandal, in which the information and publishing conglomerate is accused of trying to influence policy through bribes and bargain-priced stock shares. Prosecutors have charged four aides to senior politicians and 13 businessmen, bureaucrats and legislators in the case. Sunday's election was watched as an advance indicator of voting next month for half the seats in the upper house. Mrs. <PERSON> Ofuchi </PERSON>, the winner, campaigned against the sales tax, which took effect April 1 along with income tax cuts; criticized <PERSON> Uno </PERSON>'s party because of the Recruit scandal, and apparently won favor with rural voters oposed to opening <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to foreign farm products On Monday, <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> `` intend to listen attentively to the people's voices'' and will try to restore public confidence by making political reforms `` to prevent recurrences of the same wrongdoings.'' His party now holds now holds 143 of the 251 seats in the upper house. A telephone survey of 10,000 people conducted June 16-19 indicated only 16.7 percent supported <PERSON> Uno </PERSON>'s government, the <ORGANIZATION> Nihon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Keizai </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s leading financial newspaper, reported Monday. That was better than the 13.1 percent support rating for <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> in March, but the paper said 52.8 percent of those questioned opposed to Uno's government. The remaining 30.5 percent expressed no opinion, it said.

 Baseball's lawyers today asked an appeals court to suspend a judge's postponement of <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>'s hearing before the commissioner of baseball, saying the ruling `` threatens the very reputation'' of the game. Common Pleas Judge <PERSON> Norbert </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nadel </PERSON> on Sunday delayed for at least two weeks a hearing today at which Commissioner <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON> <PERSON> Giamatti </PERSON> was to consider allegations Rose bet on ballgames. <PERSON> Nadel </PERSON> agreed with <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> that <PERSON> Giamatti </PERSON> had already made up his mind against the <ORGANIZATION> Cincinnati </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reds </ORGANIZATION> manager and could not judge <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> fairly. In a request today for the suspension of <PERSON> Nadel </PERSON>'s temporary restraining order, baseball called the ruling unprecedented. `` If every action of the commissioner to investigate and determine matters affecting the integrity of the game were to be subject to court intervention and delay, the commissioner's ability to safeguard the integrity of the game would be destroyed,'' the request said. `` The action of the court below threatens the very reputation of major league baseball and deprives the commissioner of the power to protect the integrity of the game.'' A three-judge state appeals court panel will decide baseball's request after receiving a response from <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>'s lawyers, which is due Wednesday morning Rose could be banned from baseball for life if <PERSON> Giamatti </PERSON> accepts evidence from a baseball investigator that <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> bet on his own team. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Pitcairn </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a lawyer for <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>, was said to be in a meeting this morning and was unavailable for comment. <PERSON> Nadel </PERSON> on Sunday said the outcome of the baseball commissioner's hearing was a `` foregone conclusion. `` I think we got justice,'' said <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Reuven </PERSON> <PERSON> Katz </PERSON>. `` I'm just pleased that we get the next opportunity,'' <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> said after his team lost 7-0 to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` Obviously we're pleased about this. That's it. Next things next.'' <PERSON> Nadel </PERSON>'s ruling set a collision course with federal court decisions that have upheld the commissioner's broad authority to act when the integrity of the game is at stake. Baseball team owners <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Finley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> lost challenges of the authority of then-Commissioner <PERSON> Bowie </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuhn </PERSON> in the 1970s. `` The judge has made a mistake, a big one,'' baseball lawyer <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoynes </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said Sunday. `` It's an erroneous ruling. It's a problem, a serious mistake.'' <PERSON> Giamatti </PERSON> said he'll fight <PERSON> Nadel </PERSON>'s decision `` tooth and nail.'' `` I regret the judge's decision. I have absolutely no prejudgment or prejudice regarding <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Giamatti </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Nadel </PERSON>, who is up for re-election in 16 months, agreed with <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>'s lawyers that the commissioner had already made up his mind that <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> is guilty of betting on baseball games The judge referred to a letter at the heart of <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>'s case _ a recommendation sent by <PERSON> Giamatti </PERSON> to a federal judge as part of the sentencing of bookmaker <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Peters </PERSON>. The letter praised <PERSON> Peters </PERSON> for being `` candid, forthright and truthful'' with special baseball investigator <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dowd </PERSON>, who found evidence that <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> bet on <ORGANIZATION> Reds </ORGANIZATION> games and other baseball games in 1985, 1986 and 1987. <PERSON> Peters </PERSON> has told federal authorities who also are investigating <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> that he accepted perhaps more than $ 1 million in bets on behalf of the manager for two years. <PERSON> Nadel </PERSON> held the letter up in court Sunday as he announced his decision. `` It therefore appears to this court at this point that the commissioner of baseball has prejudged <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Nadel </PERSON> said. `` We further find that the hearing set tomorrow in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> before the commissioner of baseball would be futile and illusory and the outcome a foregone conclusion.'' <PERSON> Nadel </PERSON> ruled that baseball ca n't take any action against <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> for the 14 days the temporary restraining order is in effect. He also ruled that <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> ca n't be fired during that time. The judge set arguments for a preliminary injunction for July 6. If granted, an injunction could indefinitely block the commissioner from deciding <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>'s fate while the court takes over the case. <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> has sought just that _ getting a judge in his hometown rather than <PERSON> Giamatti </PERSON> to determine the charges. <PERSON> Nadel </PERSON>'s ruling did n't touch on the question of whether <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> bet on baseball. <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> has denied doing so, but <PERSON> Dowd </PERSON> testified before <PERSON> Nadel </PERSON> last week that the manager admitted he had bet on other professional sports. The <ORGANIZATION> Reds </ORGANIZATION>' manager was in his office behind a closed door while the decision was broadcast on television. Although he had little to say afterward, several fans displayed banners of celebration at <LOCATION> Riverfront </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stadium </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Reds </ORGANIZATION> reliever <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dibble </PERSON> expressed full support. `` <PERSON> Bart </PERSON> <PERSON> Giamatti </PERSON> knows nothing about baseball,'' <PERSON> Dibble </PERSON> said. `` That's what happens when you give somebody power like that to use against <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>.''

 Students hurled hundreds of firebombs at riot police Monday to demand freedom for a dissident clergyman who went on trial for making a trip to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. Also on Monday, prosecutors said they issued arrest warrants for three radical student leaders accused of encouraging participation in a July youth festival in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, defying a government ban. They face charges of violating the National Security Law. The Rev. <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> <PERSON> Ik-hwan </PERSON>, a 71-year-old Presbyterian minister, went on trial Monday, accused of violating the law. Thirteen students were arrested for seizing the rooftop of a six-story building near the <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> courtroom. `` Immediately release patriotic unification fighter Moon,'' read a large banner unfurled from the roof. Moon went to <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> in March, met with communist leader <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Sung </PERSON> and discussed reunifying the nations. About 1,500 police surrounded <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>'s District Criminal Court, where <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> appeared in handcuffs and tied with rope. About 200 supporters staged a sit-in to get into the courtroom, and the judge ordered some of 50 plainclothes police to give up their seats. At the capital's <ORGANIZATION> Sogang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, 500 students yelling `` Release Moon Ik-hwan!'' fought riot police with metal pipes, clubs and firebombs. Police fought back with rocks and captured clubs. In provincial <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> city, 1,000 <ORGANIZATION> Chosun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> students clashed with riot police who blocked them from marching to the prosecutor's office, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported. Students threw several hundred firebombs and rocks before they were dispersed with tear gas, <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Moon </PERSON>'s nine-day visit violated a South Korean law forbidding trips to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> without approval. <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> says dialogue on unification must go through government channels. <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> could face the death penalty, although observers say there is little chance he would be executed. <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> acknowledged the prosecutor's charge he visited <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, and said, `` It is our disgrace that we have not erased the 38th parallel,'' which divides the two nations. `` My visit was motivated by the will to solve a national tragedy.'' Moon and traveling companion <PERSON> Yoo </PERSON> <PERSON> Won-ho </PERSON>, a 59-year-old businessman, were arrested April 13 when they returned to <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. Government officials say <PERSON> Moon </PERSON>'s visit aided North Korean attempts to cause unrest in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and discredit the <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> government. Many South Koreans were shocked at television pictures showing Moon hugging North Korean leaders. Defense lawyers argue the prosecution should drop charges because the indictment was issued by the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Team </ORGANIZATION>, a group now disbanded and therefore unconstitutional.

 The foreman of the grand jury that investigated <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Kopechne </PERSON>'s death at <LOCATION> Chappaquiddick </LOCATION> in 1969 said he was approached by two `` key lawmen'' who said an inquiry was n't needed, according to a published report. Newsweek reported in its July 3 issue that <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>, a pharmacist on <PERSON> Martha </PERSON>'s Vineyard, said that the two men took him for a ride and told him their version of the night's events involving Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. `` The bottom line was that this was nothing more than an accident and a minor vehicle violation _ and there was no need for the grand jury to get involved,'' <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> said. `` There was a cover-up. All they were concerned about was protecting <PERSON> Teddy </PERSON>'s political career. It was, like, the hell with the fact that this young woman lost her life.'' Miss <PERSON> Kopechne </PERSON> was killed when the car <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was driving across a bridge on the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> island skidded into 8 feet of water. He surfaced moments later; Miss <PERSON> Kopechne </PERSON> died in the car. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Democrat failed to report the accident for 10 hours. He received a suspended sentence for leaving the scene of an accident. <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>'s dissatisfaction with the grand jury proceedings has been mentioned before, most recently in the 1988 book `` Senatorial Privilege: The Chappaquiddick Coverup'' by <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Damore </PERSON>. In it, <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> makes no mention of the ride but says he had a variety of meetings with officials and felt pressured not to ask certain questions. In response to the <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION> article, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s office issued a statement in which the senator again expressed remorse for the accident and said he takes full responsibility for the tragedy. `` I have told everything I know about the accident. I only wish that it were in my power to do something more to ease the continuing pain that I feel and that Mr. and Mrs. <PERSON> Kopechne </PERSON> feel for <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Jo </PERSON>'s loss,'' the statement said Press secretary <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Donovan </PERSON> said there would be no further comment. Newsweek did not identify the lawmen or say when the meeting with <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> occurred. In the months that followed, <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> received three anonymous death threats and for a time was under 24-hour police protection, the magazine reported. He nearly lost his pharmacy license when state officials did not send the usual renewal notice. <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> said that after he had convened the grand jury, a prosecutor warned him to watch his step or the supervising judge might cite him for contempt. The judge refused to let the grand jury subpoena witnesses or to review the record of the coroner's inquest, he said. The grand jury finally gave up and when its term ran out, the members were sworn to secrecy for the rest of their lives, the magazine said. Newsweek did n't explain why <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> decided to talk about the case now. `` They tied us up,'' <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> said. `` They had us handcuffed. It was devastating. There were two sets of rules: one for the wealthy politician _ and the other for you and me.''

 The sidewalks are hot enough to grill shrimp and one thing a tourist does n't need in the nation's capital right now is another line to stand in. But guess what they're doing in front of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> these days? Lining up for the abortion decision. Next to the weather, <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> vs. Reproductive Health Services is the hottest thing in town. Word gets around fast: The decision might come down today, so crowds were out in force hours before the court opened. The justices, who know a show-stopper when they get one, teased the appetite with a handful of important rulings, but they saved the big one for Thursday, which is probably the last day of the term. One possibility that almost everyone discounted was that the justices might schedule new arguments at the outset of the next term, which begins the first Monday in October. Big events in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> often tend to become chaotic, but not at the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, that temple of serenity. In one corner of the marble plaza in front of the court, television cameras were set up under beach umbrellas, their satellite trucks parked nearby. Microphones were ready for the reporters inside who would rush out with the decision, interrupting normal morning programming. The lines of tourists snaked down the street. Experts were standing by. <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> had a <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> law professor, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Krattenmaker </PERSON>, at the ready to lend his analysis of the abortion decision. When the court, instead, issued two decisions about the death penalty, he wound up talking about that. Nearby, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> also had a <LOCATION> Georgetown </LOCATION> law expert, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothstein </PERSON>. Demonstrators also were there, ready to spring into action with their signs and chants. Inside the courtroom, packed to capacity with reporters, lawyers and a few lucky tourists, the justice-authors of Monday's opinions read from them. One floor below the court, at the press office, dozens of reporters were crowded in a small room, waiting for the decisions to be handed out. The court employees let the papers go to the waving hands as soon as they received a telephone call from within the court chamber that the decision had indeed been handed down. Tourists managed to get into that secluded part of the court building, too, since the agony of news people in the throes of reportage can make for an entertaining sight, too. But police kept the sightseers at bay. The abortion ruling was not among Monday's output and word flashed out, `` No Webster Today.'' Demonstrators packed away their signs, TV crews took down their cameras and tourists went whereever it is that tourists go. <PERSON> Showtime </PERSON> was postponed until at least Thursday. By 10:25 a.m. the `` no <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> today'' call had been made and the street theater in front of the court dissolved. A few tourists stayed around to see the courtroom, now empty. It was 85 degrees and climbing on the plaza outside, but the weather service said the humidity made it feel like 95.

<HEAD>College Chapel Sprayed with Poison; Official Blames Right-Wingers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A suspected poison was sprayed in a college chapel hours before a West German official met there Monday with anti-apartheid leaders. A college official blamed right-wingers for the incident. About 25 staff members at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barbabas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> were treated for nasal irritation and West German Labor Minister <PERSON> Norbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bluem </PERSON> `` got a good whiff'' of the foul-smelling substance, said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Corke </PERSON>, headmaster at the school in the <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Bosmont </LOCATION>. `` We suspect that right-wingers or other intolerant elements in our society were responsible for this vandalism,'' said <PERSON> Corke </PERSON>. `` They are people who are anxious to disrupt the efforts of responsible groups working for social justice.'' <PERSON> Corke </PERSON> said there was an apparent connection between the spraying of the weedkiller _ believed to contain cyanide _ and allegations by the head of the South African Council of Churches of poisoning in an earlier incident. The Rev. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON>, the council's general secretary, recently was hospitalized in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for the effects of poisoning, which he said may have been applied to his luggage before he left <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The South African <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> quoted a police spokesman, Col. <PERSON> Frans </PERSON> <PERSON> Malherbe </PERSON>, as saying the incident was being investigated as malicious damage to property, but if poison were found, it would become an attempted murder investigation. <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON> returned to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> last week to preside over the council's 21st national conference. The church leaders met Monday morning with <PERSON> Bluem </PERSON>. Before <PERSON> Bluem </PERSON>'s entourage arrived at the college, <PERSON> Corke </PERSON> said `` a toxic and highly noxious liquid'' had been sprayed over the chapel. <PERSON> Corke </PERSON> said an examination of the substance `` by the head of our science school suggests that it is a cyanide-based insecticide or weedkiller.'' <PERSON> Corke </PERSON> said one element of the spray was ethnoic acid, which was mostly vinegar, and another was possibly an insecticide. <PERSON> Corke </PERSON> said he believed the vandals had gained access to the college chapel after 7:30 p.m. Sunday. At his meeting with the church leaders, <PERSON> Bluem </PERSON> criticized the delay and `` suppression'' of court cases connected with the killings of anti-apartheid activists, and assured his hosts that the <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> government would not make any new investments in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. But he said he was opposed to mandatory international economic sanctions, which church council leaders say would pressure the government to end its apartheid laws. Under <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s system of racial segregation, its 5 million whites control the economy and its 28 million blacks have no vote in national affairs.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> must withdraw its troops from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, Deputy Secretary of <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> said Monday. `` The Syrians have to back off,'' <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> said on Christian-owned Voice of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> radio. `` All of the outside parties ought to back off and let the <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> make their own judgment about where their future lies. There is too much foreign involvement on all sides,'' he said in an interview recorded in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. His call for a Syrian withdrawal indicated an apparent <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy shift, but the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said it was not so. <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON>'s comments appeared to reverse his March 16 statement that Syrian troops restrain warring parties in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and that their withdrawal would worsen the situation. He was speaking before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, eight days into the current round of fighting. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said Monday: `` We have often called for the withdrawal of all foreign forces in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.'' `` The deputy secretary's remarks are entirely in keeping with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy. We believe and have often said the Lebanese should be free to pursue a political process free of threats and coercion,'' <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said. In Monday's broadcast, <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> hopes <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 14-year civil war can be resolved by an <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> committee comprising <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>, King Fahd of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and Algerian President <PERSON> Chadli </PERSON> <PERSON> Bendjedid </PERSON>. `` We're obviously very hopeful that the Arab committee can, in fact, bring sense to the situation, and can convince the Syrians to withdraw plus all those other foreign parties that have gotten themselves involved in the tragedy of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> said. An Arab League summit gave the special committee six months to find a settlement in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The three <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> leaders are to meet Tuesday in the Algerian town of <LOCATION> Oran </LOCATION>. Their mission was decided by a summit of the 22-member organization after <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> refused some members' calls for it to withdraw from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, where it is the chief power broker. Lebanese Christians backed by <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>' main Arab foe, charge Syrian troops have violated a 1976 league peacekeeping mandate by siding with Moslem militiamen in recent fighting. A month after the summit, the committee still has not been able to enforce a cease-fire between Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s mostly Christian army of 20,000 and 40,000 Syrian troops in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The Syrians on Monday fired sporadic salvos of 130mm mortar shells to maintain their blockade of Christian ports north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and prevent Iraqi supplies reaching <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>. Christian gunners retaliated with a barrage of 155mm howitzer shells on the seaside boulevard of Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, where several Syrian batteries are deployed. No casualities were reported. By police count, 373 people have been killed and 1,460 wounded in the 14 weeks of bloodshed. Also Monday, police said a bomb exploded at a school in the Syrian-policed mountaintop town of <LOCATION> Dhour </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shweir </LOCATION>, injuring the principal, a teacher and seven children. <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON>'s statement was broadcast a day after Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> sent identical letters to <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> and rival Moslem leader <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> urging them to show restraint to avert further bloodshed. The prestigious An-Nahar newspaper quoted unidentified political and official sources as saying <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> is bent on overthrowing <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> by military, economic or political means. But the independent daily said the military option is out because <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> has been notified that `` it was impermissible to invade -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>.'' It did not say who gave the order. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> has declared a `` war of liberation'' to free <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> of Syrian domination.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s spokesman accused the oil industry Monday of moving too slowly on oil-spill cleanup technology and said three weekend spills highlight `` the pervasiveness of the problem.'' But presidential press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would not take any direct steps to respond to the weekend spills in <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` The White House does not intend to assume an operational role in oil spills,'' he said. `` We think the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> is fully able and adequate to carry out these responsiblities.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> also ruled out a moratorium on new oil drilling and exploration. `` We have to go ahead with exploration and development of natural resources. We have to have petroleum products for meeting our energy needs,'' he said. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said a `` commanding aspect'' of the latest spills was to show ` the pervasiveness of the problem.'' He said they underscored the need for legislation to better define tanker owners' liabilities He cited legislation proposed by the administration on May 11 to give tanker owners `` first level of responsibility'' for paying cleanup costs. Under the administration bill, tanker owners would be automatically liable for damages from $ 5 million to $ 78 million, depending on the extent of the spill and the size of the ship. A federal fund would be set up to pay cleanup costs over the $ 78 million ceiling, to be financed by a fee of 1.3 cents on every barrel of domestic as well as imported oil. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said that the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> last year received reports of 7,500 oil spills, 200 of which required a federal takeover of cleanup operations. `` We feel the industry could do more ... both individual companies and the industry as a whole, particularly in the area of research into better techniques for dealing with oil spills,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` Presumably we have had a lot of experience with oil spills. We know that they are going to occur. We have in place systems to deal with them. But we also know, from recent experience, that there are problems that have to be corrected,'' he added. He said the `` most obvious'' shortcoming is the industry's research and development into better ways to disperse oil spills `` We also find that research has not produced dispersants the way it should. That work is going forward. The sense of urgency I believe is there in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- and -RRB- in the administration. So there's no need to delay development of energy resources, but there is a need to move quickly and effectively on better techniques in dealing with oil spills.''

<HEAD>Report Romania Pulling Down Fence With Hungary</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> is pulling down a wire fence it recently built on its border with <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> state news agency reported. There was no word from <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> on the fence, which was criticized by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> at a human rights conference last week in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. The barrier was erected along a 188-mile section of the <LOCATION> Oroshaza </LOCATION> district in southeastern <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> apparently to stop Romanians from crossing into <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> illegally. `` The ` wire curtain' and the concrete pillars were almost completely removed from Saturday to Monday,'' <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. Hungarian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Gyula </PERSON> <PERSON> Horn </PERSON>, on a visit to <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, said Monday, `` I have n't heard it yet, but the news delights me.'' <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> called for <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> to re-establish an autonomous region to safeguard ethnic and cultural rights of the 1.7 million-member Hungarian minority. `` The situation is gradually deteriorating, it is disastrous,'' he said at a lecture on Hungarian foreign policy. `` But we have n't given up hope for changes. <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> said the dismantling of the fence was announced by Col. <PERSON> Janos </PERSON> <PERSON> Pal </PERSON>, commander of Hungarian frontier guards in <LOCATION> Oroshaza </LOCATION>. During the first five months of this year, 3,231 Romanians crossed illegally into <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, Hungarian officials said. About 30,000 Romanians, most ethnic Hungarians, have fled to <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> in recent years seeking refuge from chronic hardships and discrimination under President <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>. In a June 20 dispatch, <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> denied a Western report that <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> was building a wall along the border, but said a wire fence 6 -LCB- feet to 8 \ feet high was being erected and has been completed along 90 percent of the border A subsequent <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> report said Romanian authorities had piled sand on roads leading to the border, apparently to block traffic, and border guards had noticed a kind of steel `` car trap.'' <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> started building the fence 1 -LCB- years ago, but the pace of construction was speeded up in March. <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> came under bitter attack for flouting human rights of dissidents and ethnic minorities, including <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magyars </ORGANIZATION>, during the month-long <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> meeting. Even the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> criticized its ally. `` The <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> Final Act makes no mention of a barbed wall,'' said chief Soviet delegate <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Kashlev </PERSON>. `` If we were the Romanians, we would n't have done it.'' Relations between <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> have deteriorated. As communist officials in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> prepare to embrace mutliparty democracy and free elections next year, <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s hard-line government plans to raze thousands of villages, including hundreds of ethnic Hungarian communities, to force assimilation. Recently, <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> has protested alleged anti-Romanian statements made during the June 16 public funeral of <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON>, the executed leader of the 1956 uprising.

 A group of 11 Americans who went to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> despite a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> travel advisory have been charged by police in <LOCATION> Kunming </LOCATION> with distributing religious literature and ordered to remain in the city, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said today. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomat was on his way from the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> consulate in <LOCATION> Chengdu </LOCATION> to look into the situation, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The 11 Americans went to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> June 13, a week after the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> advised against traveling in the country, and had planned to return home in early July. They were detained at the <ORGANIZATION> Yunnan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> guest house and charged with distributing religious material to the public, the official said. Their passports were taken and they were forbidden to leave the city. The official said the charge in Chinese law evidently was not a serious offense. The names and hometowns of the 11 Americans were not disclosed. In <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said two Americans _ a teacher and a student at <ORGANIZATION> Nankai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in nearby <LOCATION> Tianjin </LOCATION> _ were ordered to leave <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> by Friday. Teacher <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Radicia </PERSON> and student <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Qubain </PERSON> were being expelled because `` evidently they were very involved in the student movement,'' the spokesman said on condition of anonymity. The two, whose ages and hometowns were not immediately known, had been questioned several times by security forces, he said.

 Environmental experts said Monday most of the estimated 420,000 gallons of oil spilled into the ocean no longer threatened the shore, and federal officials began a criminal investigation. Only a few small patches of oil could be seen in <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sound </LOCATION> and along the state's shoreline, state and federal officials said. `` The worst is over,'' said <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Payton </PERSON>, an oceanographer with the <ORGANIZATION> Natonal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanographic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. `` There's not going to be any more shoreline impacts like there were at the beginning I'm confident of that.'' She estimated no more than 5 percent of the highly toxic oil spilled from the tanker World Prodigy remained floating on the water. The tanker, loaded with nearly 8 million gallons, went aground Friday on <LOCATION> Brenton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reef </LOCATION> at the mouth of <LOCATION> Narragansett </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> estimated 420,000 gallons spilled. There had been some reports of lobsters killed and several small birds found dead, but officials said those did not appear to be widespread. `` My feeling is that people in <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, scientists included, are being maybe a bit upbeat,'' warned <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sargent </PERSON>, director of the coastlines project at the <ORGANIZATION> Woods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hole </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanographic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. Agents from the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and three other state and federal agencies met with <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> attorneys to begin their investigation into the accident, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> <PERSON> Almond </PERSON>. `` The problem that we have is that some of the information the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> has has been immunized and can not be used by us,'' Almond said. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> has been gathering material for a joint investigation with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> that will open Tuesday in <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION>, said Capt. <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>'s marine safety office. Because some of that information must be provided by law to the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, it can not be used in a criminal investigation, <PERSON> Almond </PERSON> said. Among the statements in question was an admission by the ship's Greek master that he mistakenly brought the 533-foot vessel into the harbor without a pilot. Criminal charges could be filed for negligent operation of a vessel or under the Clean Water or Refuse acts, <PERSON> Almond </PERSON> said. Each is a misdemeanor with a maximum jail term of one year, but the Clean Act violation could mean a fine of double the damages against the ship's owner, <ORGANIZATION> Bollard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Athens </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Almond </PERSON> said. State beaches from <LOCATION> Jamestown </LOCATION> almost to <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> remained closed as a precaution, although eastern beaches were open. A statewide shellfishing ban remained in effect. Conditions were `` much, much better than yesterday,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morin </PERSON>, state director of groundwater and wetlands, after he and other officials flew over the area. `` I have n't seen it anywhere on the beaches we've flown today,'' he said. There was some problem with boaters, who ignored requests to stay out of the area, dragging oil along in their wake, he said. Crews used booms and pads that can absorb up to 50 times their weight in oil to soak up the remaining contamination, said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Annarummo </PERSON>, deputy director of the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>. He said officials had not decided how to dispose of the pads, which must be handled as hazardous waste. Coast Guard Capt. <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said 72,500 barrels of oil were left on the ship by mid-morning, of the 195,000 barrels it had been carrying. He estimated the removal would take a day or two more and said the ship would not be moved until it was empty.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Heath </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkins </PERSON> was 16 when he stabbed to death a convenience-store clerk as she pleaded for her life. His attorneys described a childhood of abuse, drugs and liquor. His first burglary was at age 7, and at 10 he bought rat poison, tried it on a dog, then put it into Tylenol capsules for his mother and her boyfriend. She secretly emptied the capsules, then made <PERSON> Wilkins </PERSON> swallow them. In July 1985, <PERSON> Wilkins </PERSON> plotted the robbery of <PERSON> Linda </PERSON>'s Liquors and <LOCATION> Deli </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Avondale </LOCATION>. He told a girlfriend, another friend and <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> `` </PERSON> <PERSON> Bo </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> about the plan; he and <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> robbed the store while the others waited nearby. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> grabbed <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, 26, and <PERSON> Wilkins </PERSON> stabbed her in the back and chest. As she pleaded for mercy, he stabbed her in the throat. The robbery netted $ 450, cigarettes, rolling papers, cheap wine and peppermint schnapps. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and was sentenced to life in prison. The two other accomplices were convicted of conspiracy to commit first-degree murder; one got probation and the other was sentenced to 15 years. A state judge is to rule July 26 on <PERSON> Wilkins </PERSON>' request for a new trial based on the argument he was not mentally competent at the time of the crime.

 <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanford </PERSON> plunged into crime at age 9. He was a drug addict at 12, and was arrested for robbery, burglary, assault, attempted rape and other crimes by 17. That's when he raped, robbed and murdered a gas station attendant. <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> came from <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>'s low-income West End, his surroundings modest but hardly desperate. He apparently never knew his father; his mother, a hospital therapist, worked long hours. Until he was 6, he lived mostly with his near-invalid grandmother. He quit school after ninth grade. On Jan. 7, 1981, <PERSON> Baerbel </PERSON> <PERSON> Poore </PERSON>, 20, was alone at a Cheker Oil station next to <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION>'s apartment, working nights to support an infant daughter. <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> and two other teens decided to rob the station. <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON>, 18, sexually abused and terrorized <PERSON> Poore </PERSON> in the bathroom while 15-year-old <PERSON> Troy </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> waited out in a car. <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> then forced <PERSON> Poore </PERSON> into her car and drove with her to a woods, followed by the other two. <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> gave her a last cigarette, then shot her twice in the head.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled Monday that skyrocketing punitive damage awards in personal-injury lawsuits do n't violate the Constitution's ban on excessive fines. But the 7-2 ruling left open the possibility that due-process guarantees _ the Constitution's assurance of fair play for all _ may be used to put a cap on the amount of money in such suits. Some justices practically invited a new appeal to resolve the due-process issue. Justices <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, in a concurring opinion, said the ruling `` leaves the door open for a holding that the due process clause constrains the imposition of punitive damages.'' Some studies show punitive damages have soared in recent years. One such study found that the average punitive damage award in personal injury cases in <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, was $ 14,000 for a five-year period ending in 1969 and $ 1.9 million for a comparable period concluding in 1984. Industry spokesmen were disappointed with Monday's ruling, but hopeful they could win in the future. `` We're happy to see at least four justices interested in the due process challenge,'' said <PERSON> Quentin </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegel </PERSON>, a lawyer with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION>. `` I expect a quick acceptance of a case with that issue, perhaps later this week.'' The court upheld a $ 6 million award a jury ordered a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> waste-collection company to pay a <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> competitor for trying to drive the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> company out of business. Writing for the court, Justice <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> said the Constitution's Eighth Amendment prohibiting cruel and unusual punishment and excessive fines does n't apply to civil lawsuits between private citizens or corporations. The ban is designed to protect people against excessive punishment by the government, generally in criminal prosecutions, he said. `` The fact that punitive damages are imposed through the aegis of courts and serve to advance governmental interests is insufficient'' to apply the excessive fines clause to a private suit, <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> said. He relied in part on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Constitution and also on English common law dating to the 13th century when, <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> said, `` awarding damages far in excess of actual compensation for quantifiable injuries was well recognized.'' <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> suggested the court might be willing to place a ceiling on such awards if it could be shown that run-away juries violated due-process standards. Justices <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, in a dissenting opinion, said punitive damages may violate the Constitution's ban on excessive fines. Business leaders have clashed for years with lawyers and consumer groups over the legitimacy of multimillion dollar awards in a wide range of lawsuits. Those who oppose the big-money awards say they are catastrophic for American competitiveness and development of new products, particularly new forms of medical treatment. They say juries capriciously penalize the wealthy to benefit those who have suffered injuries, particularly if the victim is from nearby and the defendant is from another state or region. Consumer activists and trial lawyers say punitive damages are a powerful deterrent to corporate greed that poses a threat to public safety. They say smaller compensatory awards may be viewed by large corporations as a cost of doing business. Some state legislatures, reacting to soaring insurance rates, have imposed ceilings on how much money can be recovered in personal-injury cases. Monday's case involved a $ 6 million punitive damage award against <ORGANIZATION> Browning-Ferris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a waste-collection company based in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> with annual revenues exceeding $ 1.3 billion. The company was ordered to pay the money to <ORGANIZATION> Kelco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disposal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vt. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON> left <ORGANIZATION> Browning-Ferris </ORGANIZATION> to form <ORGANIZATION> Kelco </ORGANIZATION> in 1980 and soon captured more than 40 percent of the market in the <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION> area <ORGANIZATION> Browning-Ferris </ORGANIZATION> allegedly instructed its new <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION> manager to `` put <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON> out of business. Do whatever it takes. Squish him like a bug.'' <ORGANIZATION> Browning-Ferris </ORGANIZATION> cut prices almost in half, but failed to drive <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON> out. <ORGANIZATION> Browning-Ferris </ORGANIZATION> ultimately left the <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> market. A <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> jury awarded <ORGANIZATION> Kelco </ORGANIZATION> $ 51,146 in compensatory damages and $ 6 million in punitive damages.

<HEAD>Aseptic Juice Boxes, Microwaving Among Group's Top Food Inventions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The half-pint juice box popular with children at snacktime tops the list of the best food science inventions in the last 50 years, says a food technology group. A panel on food safety and nutrition for the Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologists </ORGANIZATION> ranked better ways of canning vegetables second and the development of the microwave oven third. The list was announced Sunday. The juice boxes are an example of `` aseptic'' packaging, in which liquids are heated quickly to kill germs, then cooled and placed into sterile, airtight containers. The juice or milk stays fresh even if the boxes are not kept cold. Among the other top innovations in the technologists' list are frozen concentrated citrus juices, freeze drying, frozen meals, food fortification, and improved methods of sterilizing milk. The group developed the list in connection with its 50th anniversary celebration this month. `` These innovations have helped to ensure healthier eating, while also reducing food bills significantly,'' said <PERSON> Fergus </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clydesdale </PERSON>, chairman of the panel that compiled the list and head of the food science department at the University of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Clydesdale </PERSON> said life expectanty has increased so much since the last century partly because of the availability of more nutritious, safer food. `` We do n't get the kinds of infections from food we used to,'' he said. `` That is because of the incredible sanitation that we did n't have before. While canning food has been done for centuries, it was included on the list because of a relatively new process used to can vegetables. `` In the past, food was placed in a can and heated,'' <PERSON> Clydesdale </PERSON> said. `` Often the food would be overheated, not only killing bacteria, but also knocking out nutrients.''

<HEAD>Bush Decries Violence Against Women</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Monday said `` archaic and unacceptable'' attitudes toward women help breed violent crimes against them and can rob them of full equality in American life. `` This war against women must stop,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> declared in an address to 2,000 people at a convention of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION>. He said women can be victims not only of husbands' abuse and street violence, but also economic victims of `` a climate of fear'' that leaves them afraid to work late or walk to a library at night. He said it was `` unthinkable'' that his seven granddaughters should not have the same opportunities in life as his four grandsons. However, he added: `` No matter how equal the opportunities in our schools and workplace, women will never have the same opportunities as men if a climate of fear leaves them justifiably concerned at walking to the campus library at night, or reluctant to work late hours for fear of getting out of some parking lot safely.'' He did not propose any specific new remedies to protect women, but he said they would gain wider protection from the $ 1.2 billion anti-crime package he sent <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> June 15. That initiative calls for building more federal prisons, hiring more prosecutors and slapping tougher penalties on criminals who use firearms. `` All too often, violent crime also means crime against women,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` I am angered and disgusted by the crimes against <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> women and by the archaic and unacceptable attitudes that all too frequently contribute to those crimes. `` Whether it involves spouse abuse at home or violence in the street, these are evil acts that transcend racial and class lines,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. He cited no examples, but his words called to mind the recent rape of a jogger by a teen gang in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Central Park as well as the murder of several women by their estranged husbands _ one on a furlough from an <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> prison. <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said, `` The president's passion for this comes from his experiences like his discussions with -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- agents in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'' and his talks last Thursday with runaway kids at the <ORGANIZATION> Covenant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> shelter in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the women's group those youths had spoken to him about drugs, prostitution `` and hopelessness.'' `` It was tragic. And it brought home to me, loud and clear, how much we have left to do in terms of offering hope, through education, to the young people affected by this scourge of narcotics,'' he said. `` Fundamentally, violence against women wo n't subside unless public attitudes change. We must continue to educate police and prosecutors, judges and juries, and we must engender a climate where the message our children get, in television and films, from schools and parents, is that violence against women is wrong.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> closed the speech quoting the 19th century Frenchman <PERSON> Alexis </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Tocqueville </PERSON> as saying the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> owed its singular prosperity and growing strength `` to the superiority of their women.'' Asked if that referred to their intelligence or looks, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> replied, `` We better not try and interpret <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Tocqueville </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> received an honorary membership in the 140,000-member organization. `` Technically that makes me the first <ORGANIZATION> AAUW </ORGANIZATION> member to be president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, but I know I wo n't be the last,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> AAUW </ORGANIZATION>, founded in 1881, promotes equal opportunity and advancement for women and girls at all levels of education.

<HEAD>Growers Devoting 1.41 Million Acres to Four Major Crops</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Vegetable processors have contracted to a sharply larger acreage this year to help make up for 1988 drought-shriveled production, an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report showed Monday. Overall, growers will have 1.41 million acres devoted to four major vegetable crops in 1989, a 14 percent increase from last year and 15 percent more than in 1987. `` Planted acreage of snap beans is up 22 percent; sweet corn is up 8 percent; green peas jumped 15 percent; while tomatoes increased 17 percent,'' the report said. Vegetables contracted for canning totaled 970,000 acres, including tomatoes, a 13 percent increase. Freezers contracted 441,000 acres, up 17 percent. Reduced production last year because of drought helped boost vegetable prices sharply, including further rises in the first quarter of 1989, according to department economists. Consumer food prices generally this year are expected to rise an average of 4 percent to 7 percent, compared with a rise in 1988 of 4.1 percent. The retail price of processed vegetables by themselves rose an average of 4.8 percent in 1988, compared with a 2.8 percent increase in 1987. This year, according to <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> economists, consumer prices of processed vegetables are expected to be 8 percent to 10 percent higher.

<HEAD>US Embassy Official Writes of Bolivians as ``Trolls''</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The just-departed spokesman at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> called Bolivians `` trolls ... short and dark and strange'' in a fictional story, prompting a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> review of the piece Monday. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>, author of `` Stone Cowboy on the High Plains,'' published the story in the June editions of the The Atlantic Monthly. The magazine described him as the information officer and spokesman at the embassy in <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paz </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> was asked about the story after the Council on Hemispheric Affairs, a liberal think tank that studies Latin American issues, drew attention to it in a statement. <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said he was unaware of the article, but added: `` I can assure you we'll go out and buy a copy of the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> this afternoon.'' The hero of <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>' fictional story, <PERSON> Roger </PERSON>, is a character who has spent time in a Bolivian jail and is eager to leave the country. <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> writes: `` -LRB- All Bolivians were trolls, <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> had decided a long time ago. They were short and dark and strange, not like people, really, but humanlike to a certain extent. -RRB-'' At another point, <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> writes that only llamas, alpacas and trolls could survive in the high altitudes of <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>. `` Real people needed air with something in it their lungs could chew on,'' he wrote. Later, he wrote: `` Something in the way the trolls said that word was offensive, as if they were the human ones and Americans were some low breed of dog.'' <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> could not be reached for comment. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Wharton </PERSON>, the press attache in <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paz </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> left <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paz </ORGANIZATION> last Thursday on home leave in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> with relatives. <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> has been assigned to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, where he will assume his post at the embassy in August. <PERSON> Wharton </PERSON> said he knew that <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> enjoyed his tour in <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> and had no intention of making disparaging remarks about the people. He did not know whether <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> had submitted the story for any pre-publication review by <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Birns </PERSON>, head of the council, called the written characterization of the Bolivians `` outrageous.'' He said <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> should be recalled and reassigned to a country outside the hemisphere for his `` racist and derogatory'' short story. <PERSON> Emily </PERSON> <PERSON> Eakin </PERSON>, assistant to the fiction editor at the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>, said the magazine had received at least two letters to the editor criticizing the story for `` racial stereotypes.'' But others had praised the piece, she said.

Trade was discussed briefly, he said.

<HEAD>Legislator Calls for Brezhnev Medal to be Withdrawn</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A legislator Monday suggested withdrawing the nation's highest military order from <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>, the former Soviet leader awarded the honor for his service in World War II, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported. Supreme Soviet deputy <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Likhachev </PERSON> said many people see the decoration as one of <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>'s undeserved rewards. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, however, said the legislature was not empowered to revoke the award. <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> rose to major general serving as a political officer in the war and got the jewel-encrusted Order of Victory in 1978, 33 years after the war ended. He died in 1982. Stripping him of the honor would further discredit the man now widely condemned for plunging the economy into crisis and stagnating the rest of Soviet society. His name has been stripped off cities and ships, and his relatives have lost some of the benefits given family members of a Soviet leader. In recent years, <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> has been satirized for all the medals he received, many of which he awarded himself. <PERSON> Likhachev </PERSON> spoke when the Supreme Soviet, the nation's first full-time lawmaking body, convened Monday to confirm <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> members and organize writing bills and ratifying treaties, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. These are new powers for the Supreme Soviet, a division of the larger <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> Deputies that began work May 25. In closed hearings, legislative committees rejected at least four of more than 60 nominees for ministerial and other senior posts. The fight now moves to the full 542-member body. Several deputies have objected to the large number of military and defense industry representatives on a committee to oversee defense and the dreaded <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> secret police. But they were told Monday the experts deliberately were assigned to committees in their area of professional expertise, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. The government daily newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> reported the committee's hearings will be held behind closed doors, despite calls for more openness in those areas The chamber approved the composition of its committees after changes, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said without elaborating.

 <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON>'s lawyer told a judge Monday that the mother of a teen-ager <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> allegedly videotaped during a sexual encounter has no grounds to sue because the girl is not living with her mother. The attorney also argued that the mother has suffered no direct harm from the tape, which has been copied and widely circulated, and shown _ in edited form _ on television. The hearing before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Tidwell </PERSON> was on a motion by <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON>'s attorneys to dismiss a lawsuit filed by <PERSON> Lena </PERSON> <PERSON> Arlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, the <PERSON> Marietta </PERSON> woman who accused <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> of seducing her then-16-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Lena </PERSON> <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Parsons </PERSON>, during the Democratic National Convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. The suit, which says <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> inflicted emotional harm on the mother, seeks unspecified damages. According to the lawsuit, <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> made the sexually explicit tape in his hotel room while visiting <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> for the political convention last July. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> said the `` totality of conduct by Mr. <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> constitutes seduction.'' The videotape shows a man believed to be <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> in a room with Miss <PERSON> Parsons </PERSON> and another woman. It shows the teen-ager having sex with the woman, with the man heard and seen giving directions, but it does not show intercourse between the actor and Miss <PERSON> Parsons </PERSON>. A different segment of the tape, apparently taken at a different time, shows the man having sex with others. <PERSON> Tidwell </PERSON> heard 40 minutes of arguments Monday but did not indicate when he would rule. <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON>, 25-year-old star of such films as `` St. Elmo's Fire'' and `` About Last Night,'' did not attend the hearing. <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Neely </PERSON>, representing <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON>, told the judge that <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> law, under which the suit was filed, says only a custodial parent has the right to take legal action on a matter concerning a child. Miss <PERSON> Parsons </PERSON>' parents have divorced in the past year and her father was granted custody, <PERSON> Neely </PERSON> said. Mrs. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> has not suffered direct harm as a result of the alleged encounter, <PERSON> Neely </PERSON> argued. `` <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> has always been quite definite ... there must be direct impact on the person who is contending -LRB- harm -RRB-,'' he said. Even if <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> did make the tape involving Miss Parsons, it can not be shown that it directly had an impact on the mother, <PERSON> Neely </PERSON> said. `` The plaintiffs have gone to great lengths -LRB- to show -RRB- they're not bringing this case on behalf of the young lady. They are bringing it on behalf of the mother,'' he said. Mrs. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Hue </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Parsons </PERSON> was living with her mother at the time the videotape was made. He said the tape has caused direct harm by humiliating the family and straining the parent-daughter relationship. `` This is a case of wanton, willful, intentional misconduct,'' <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> told the judge.

 The estimated 420,000 gallons of oil spilled from a tanker off <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION> on Friday had largely dispersed or evaporated by Monday morning, officials said. The Greek tanker World Prodigy struck a reef Friday at mouth of <LOCATION> Narragansett </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. The spill was initially estimated at up to 1.6 million gallons. The light oil had spread over an area of almost 30 square miles by late Sunday. An undetermined number of oil-covered small lobsters and several birds were found dead.

An estimated 800,000 gallons of industrial heating oil was unaccounted for, including an undetermined amount that became mixed with water and remained in the vessel. Some oil fouled shores on both <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> sides of the river, plus some shores upstream in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, but mostly the globs were too large to wash ashore.

<HEAD>City Pays $1.6 Million Extra After Insurer Sends Check Late</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Taxpayers in this <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> suburb will pay an extra $ 1.6 million because the town's insurance company was four days late mailing a check to survivors of a man killed in a 1982 police shooting. Circuit Judge <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> doubled the $ 1.6 million award to the estate of <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, 36, for the shooting, which led to the 1985 manslaughter conviction of Officer <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Killian </PERSON>. Police in nearby <PERSON> Southgate </PERSON> began chasing <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> after they saw him apparently commit a traffic violation. <PERSON> Killian </PERSON> joined the chase as it went through <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> <PERSON> Park </PERSON>, and shot <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> to death near <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' home in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> <PERSON> Park </PERSON>, a town of 45,000, and California-based <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> agreed to a $ 1.6 million settlement in the shooting. The insurer paid $ 500,000 on time in 1986 but was four days late with the remaining $ 1.1 million, City Attorney <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Zelenak </PERSON> said. The company is now bankrupt. Mayor <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Heyer </PERSON> said he had no explanation for the late payment. `` I would have been willing to get on a plane and go get the check if someone would have asked me to,'' said <PERSON> Heyer </PERSON>, who was police chief at the time of the shooting. `` We thought everything was taken care of.'' After the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> refused to hear an appeal of <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>'s decision, <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> made the award final May 19. To pay the award, taxpayers are being assessed about $ 50 each this year and about $ 30 each next year. City officials would like to get the extra $ 1.6 million from the insurers, but since the company is bankrupt they do n't have high hopes. `` The bottom line is, a deal is a deal,'' the mayor said. `` I think the average citizen will realize this is one of the costs we have to pay to provide law enforcement.''

 The congressman who spurred an investigation into the death of a recruit last year at a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> training school said Monday there's no sign that a second death there stemmed from similar problems. After an extensive briefing by the chief of <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> training, Rep. <PERSON> Toby </PERSON> <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>, R-Wis., said he saw no evidence of failed safety procedures, instructor abuse or a lack of emergency services in the death Friday at the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Training </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>. A naval aviation officer candidate, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Fedie </PERSON>, 22, of <LOCATION> Altoona </LOCATION>, died Friday in shallow water after a training A preliminary autopsy showed abnormal brain swelling, and further tests were under way. In March 1988, <PERSON> Airman </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON>, 19, of <PERSON> Appleton </PERSON> died during a different type of exercise. `` It is really eerie that this should happen to another young sailor from <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> at the very same training facility,'' said <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>. <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> had ordered a congressional investigation into the death of <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON>, a constituent, after the young man's family raised questions about the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s explanation for the death. In the <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> case, the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' investigative arm, found failures in safety procedures, abuse of trainees by instructors and a lack of emergency services The probe led to reforms at the school and disciplinary action against a number of instructors and school administrators. A pathologist concluded that <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> had an abnormal fear of being pulled under water and died of heart failure and drowning when he was forced under water during training. Though Fedie is not from <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>'s district, <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> has looked into his death also. He said he had an extensive discussion Monday with Adm. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Disher </PERSON>, who is chief of <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> training worldwide. `` It's clear as a bell the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> is handling this -LRB- death -RRB- in an entirely different way,'' <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> said in an interview in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. He said <PERSON> Disher </PERSON> `` appears to be on top of the situation, whereas last year we had a lot of stonewalling.'' <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> said <PERSON> Fedie </PERSON> was wearing a uniform and normal gear when he jumped from the 12-foot tower at the training pool for an abandon-ship exercise. <PERSON> Fedie </PERSON>'s father has described him as an excellent swimmer. After <PERSON> Fedie </PERSON> collapsed in shallow water as he was leaving the pool, safety officers pulled him immediately from the water and began first aid. An ambulance arrived within four minutes, <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> said, and a doctor arrived shortly thereafter in a backup ambulance. A preliminary autopsy Saturday indicated <PERSON> Fedie </PERSON> died from acute cerebral edema caused by an abnormal accumulation of fluid, said <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Esty </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> and Training Command. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has temporarily suspended the abandon-ship exercise <PERSON> Fedie </PERSON> had just completed when he collapsed and died, <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> said.

 <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurt </PERSON> ordered his housekeeper to shred financial records when the actor learned his former lover was suing him, the ex-employee testified Monday. Former housekeeper <PERSON> Dianna </PERSON> <PERSON> Schiebel </PERSON>'s testimony came on the fifth day of a trial to determine whether Hurt, 39, had a common-law marriage with <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>, the 32-year-old mother of <PERSON> Hurt </PERSON>'s son. <PERSON> Schiebel </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hurt </PERSON> told her in May 1988, `` <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> is suing me for divorce. We have to be very careful from now on in everything we say and do because <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> will be looking for information that could hurt me.'' `` He told me I had to take the financial records and quietly destroy them,'' <PERSON> Schiebel </PERSON> said. Hurt, sitting at the defense table, lowered his head and ran his fingers through his thinning blond hair. <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> sat with her back turned toward Hurt and stared at <LOCATION> Schiebel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>' lawyer, <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Golub </PERSON>, asked whether the documents had been destroyed. <PERSON> Schiebel </PERSON> that they had been shredded. `` Did Mr. <PERSON> Hurt </PERSON> own a shredder?'' `` Yes,'' <PERSON> Schiebel </PERSON> answered just as <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>, one of Hurt's attorneys, objected The objection was sustained. <PERSON> Schiebel </PERSON> said Hurt also worried about electronic eavesdropping. `` He started looking for a company to sweep the house for bugs,'' she said. `` He felt the house was bugged.'' <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>, a former dancer with the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ballet </LOCATION>, is suing Hurt for divorce, claiming they have a common-law marriage. <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> wants up to half of everything he's earned for the past 6 -LCB- years. <PERSON> Golub </PERSON> says Hurt, who starred in `` Kiss of the Spider Woman,'' `` Gorky Park,'' `` Body Heat,'' and `` Accidental Tourist,'' is worth about $ 10 million. <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> bases her common-law marriage claim on four weeks she spent with Hurt in <LOCATION> Beaufort </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, where he was filming `` The Big Chill.'' She says the marriage began Dec. 9, 1982, when the actor learned he was divorced from actress <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurt </PERSON>. He and <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> left the state Jan. 10, 1983. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> permits common-law marriages. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, where the two lived together nearly all of the time they were together, does not. <PERSON> Schiebel </PERSON> said she met Hurt in May 1987, when he hired her housekeeping business, Kitchen Witch. She said he often called <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> and their son, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Devon </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurt </PERSON>, now 6, `` my family.'' Earlier Monday, attorney <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Graber </PERSON> testified that Hurt and <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> came to his Beaufort office around Dec. 27, 1982, and signed a document he considered a premarital agreement. <PERSON> Graber </PERSON> said the couple also signed an acknowledgement of paternity, which he witnessed. He said he did not charge them a fee. Hurt has testified he did not recall ever signing a premarital agreement with <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>. Judge <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> Silberman </PERSON>, who is hearing the non-jury case, has said she will concern herself mainly with what happened in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Anti-Apartheid Activist Seeks More Sanctions Against South Africa</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Albertina </PERSON> <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON>, the South African anti-apartheid activist invited to visit by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, said Monday she favors additional international sanctions against her country's white government. Mrs. <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON> said she views the invitation by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as a breakthrough that might portend a more active <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> role in bringing about negotiations between <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s black majority and its government. He invited her last month after meeting with three other anti-apartheid leaders visiting the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON>, 71, whose family has come to symbolize the fight against racial segregation in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, meets with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials later this week. This is the first time she has been allowed to leave <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Because she was invited by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON> told reporters, she did not encounter difficulties getting a passport. But the document only allows her to travel to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and is only valid for 31 days, she added. Mrs. <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON>, a nurse, is one of three joint presidents of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, treasurer of the Women's League of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and a founder of the Federation of South African Women. Her husband, <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON>, has been serving a life sentence since 1964 for being one of the founders of the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>, along with its jailed leader, <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>. Two of Mrs. <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON>'s five children have fled into exile to avoid imprisonment, and she served various jail terms and has been under house arrest and other government restrictions for 18 years. Mrs. <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON> declined to say what she would tell <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, but said that `` we would like the outside world to help us with comprehensive and mandatory sanctions'' in order to pressure the government. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> imposed limited economic sanctions against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in 1986 after his veto was overriden by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Efforts by liberal Democrats in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to broaden the sanctions have so far failed. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, while reluctant to support additional sanctions, has endorsed a more active <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> role in bringing about negotiations to end the apartheid system of segregation and grant political rights to blacks. Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> is scheduled to meet next month in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> with F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, who is expected to assume his country's presidency later this year and will be the first South African government leader on an official visit here in 30 years. Mrs. <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON> said that despite his promise to enact political reform and end the domination of 28 million blacks by 5 million whites, `` we see no change with <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>.'' His predecessor, President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, made similar promises and failed to fulfill them, she added. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> should legalize the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> and return its leaders from exile so he can negotiate with them, she said. Mrs. <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON> praised former <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON>, the first American black to hold that job, saying he had helped obtain the release of South African children from jail. `` We are sorry to lose him,'' she said. <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON> returned here recently to head the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Menem's Conservative Proposals Spark Dissent in Peronist Ranks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED McCULLOUGH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President-elect <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>, who has translated the radical slogans of his <ORGANIZATION> Peronist </ORGANIZATION> campaign into conservative proposals in the face of economic chaos, said Monday he would fight for his program. He appealed to the <ORGANIZATION> Peronist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> for support, but said, `` I am ready for an internal battle'' if necessary. `` My political life has not been a bed of roses,'' <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>, who is to take office July 8, said in an interview with Radio Mitre. `` I've had to take roads full of rubble and thorns, but when there is firmness, capacity and a bit of audacity, things turn out well. The 58-year-old provincial governor was elected May 14 with the support of organized labor and the working poor. The Peronists and their allies also won control of the legislature. Argentines expected a government that would spur employment, continue the government's role in the economy and improve public services without raising their cost. As a candidate, <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> promised huge pay increases and `` work, work and more work.'' He criticized increases in utility rates, hinted at suspending payments on the $ 60 billion foreign debt and opposed efforts to sell inefficient state-owned companies to private investors. As president-elect, he included three conservative non-Peronists in his eight-member <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> and picked an economic team that proposes large increases in utility rates, partial sale of the state telephone and oil companies and a new currency. An austerity program being devised to combat triple-digit inflation, recession and a chronic budget deficit will be `` extremely hard,'' he said last weekend. <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> was asked on Friday how Argentines could afford higher gasoline prices. `` Normally, workers do n't have their own cars,'' he replied. `` Those who have cars and ca n't afford gas will have to put them away and buy a bicycle. ... In <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and other parts of the world, they ride bikes. It's good for your health.'' Argentines were jolted by the statement. They consider car ownership an achievable goal, if no longer a right, along with home ownership and annual vacations. The <ORGANIZATION> Peronist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and its backbone, the 4 million-member <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Confederation </ORGANIZATION>, have accepted <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>'s decisions so far, but some party and union leaders are upset. <PERSON> Saul </PERSON> <PERSON> Ubaldini </PERSON>, the labor coalition's secretary-general, organized 13 general strikes against President <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ubaldini </PERSON> rejected <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>'s offer of foreign diplomatic post, which was seen as an attempt to get the labor leader out of the way. <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> made the offer public and further undercut <PERSON> Ubaldini </PERSON> by rejecting his demand that <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> halt payments on the foreign debt. Other clashes are possible on the minimum wage, maintenance of collective bargaining agreements and the right to strike. <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Triaca </PERSON>, <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>'s designated labor minister, recently asked <PERSON> Ubaldini </PERSON> for a pledge not to call a general strike for two years. <PERSON> Ubaldini </PERSON> refused. When <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>'s government agreed last week to raise the monthly minimum wage by 130 percent to 20,000 australs -LRB- about $ 44 -RRB-, <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>'s transition team expressed concern about where the money would come from <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>'s six-year term ends Dec. 10 under the constitution, but he said two weeks ago he would step down early because he could not stabilize the economy. Inflation was 78.5 percent in May and is almost certain to be higher for June. Monthly interest rates surpassed 200 percent last week. Construction in <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION> has virtually halted. Auto, electronics and other assembly lines have partially shut down. Hospitals and pharmacies are short on medical supplies and <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Serenisima </PERSON>, one of the largest dairies, has filed for bankruptcy. No payments have been made on the foreign debt since last year, and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> is about $ 4 billion in arrears. The <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> has only about $ 140 million in foreign reserves, <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> said, and new loans from abroad are unlikely. The budget deficit and unemployment are growing. Real wages have shrunk by at least 30 percent so far this year. <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> describes the <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> he will inherit as `` poisoned, calamitous and chaotic,'' and says he has fashioned a government of national unity to improve it. `` Those who criticized me most severely in the past now understand that they were wrong,'' he said Monday. `` I hope my supporters who are now raising their voices finally understand that <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> is not working'' just for the 6 million who voted for him, `` but has to govern the 30 million'' citizens of <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, he declared.

 A decorated general charged with betraying the ideals of the Cuban revolution by trafficking in cocaine, ivory and diamonds appeared for a second day Monday before a military honor tribunal. The court of 47 top-ranking officers was expected to conclude Monday with a recommendation for a court-martial, <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials said on condition of anonymity. They said the court-martial of Division Gen. <PERSON> Arnalfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> might begin as soon as Tuesday. The official Cuban news agency, <PERSON> Prensa </PERSON> <PERSON> Latina </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> admitted he was guilty of the charges Sunday during the tribunal's first session In a statement, <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> said he `` accepted responsibility'' for his actions, the agency said. Defense Minister Gen. <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>, brother of President <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>, told the tribunal Sunday that <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON>'s punishment should `` set an example.'' Some Foreign Ministry officials interpreted this to mean <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> might face a firing squad. But others speculated <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> might be spared because of his decorated combat service, his long friendship with Gen. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> and his rank, one of the highest in the Revolutionary Armed Forces. <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> is accused of being the ringleader of military and <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials who collaborated with the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel, the world's largest cocaine-smuggling operation, based in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. He is also accused of smuggling ivory and diamonds. Gen. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> of trying to build his own power base, a clique beholdened by lavish gifts. His comments were interpreted to mean that <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> may have become a threat to the established order run by the <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> brothers since the Marxist revolution in 1959. Gen. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> said that after <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> returned from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> last year, he began spreading lavish gifts around `` in a delirous exercise of self-complacency.'' He said <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> was trying to create `` an image and ties of personal gratitude with an absolute lack of principle and ethics.'' The government has mounted an intensive public relations campaign against <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON>, describing his alleged corruption in extraordinary detail in <LOCATION> Granma </LOCATION>, the official newspaper of the Cuban <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Granma </PERSON> published the entire text of Gen. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>'s remarks to the tribunal on its front page on Monday. <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> residents have mobbed news vendors since the scandal broke on Thursday, buying up every available copy of Granma minutes after it hits the streets. In a break from its usual reticence to report on internal affairs, <PERSON> Prensa </PERSON> <PERSON> Latina </PERSON> has distributed extensive reports on the drug scandal. Cuban televison showed film from the closed tribunal on Sunday night, and government radio has run scores of interviews with soldiers and officers who professed outrage at <LOCATION> Ochoa </LOCATION> for betraying the high moral stands of the revolution and the armed forces. <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> was decorated for his service as a field commander in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> in 1987 and 1988 and is one of only five officers ever awarded the Hero of the Republic of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. Gen. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> on Sunday told the tribunal that <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON>'s actions were `` a stab in the back to the fatherland.''

 <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it is deferring consideration of $ 780 million in loans to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> which have been stalled since troops cleared demonstrators for democracy from <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>.

The directors represent the 151 countries that own the bank, the major source of aid money to Third World countries. The 22 directors include one Chinese and one American. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> officials explained that <PERSON> Conable </PERSON>'s action was intended to leave time to determine whether disturbances would prevent carrying out the terms of existing loans to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.

 Moslem guerrillas killed 1,748 soldiers and wounded 3,438 in five months, the government said Monday in its first detailed casualty report on the war since the Soviet withdrawal. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Nabi </PERSON> <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said 1,577 civilians were killed and 3,442 wounded during the period, Jan. 20 to June 21. He blamed the rebels for the civilian casulties. Afghan soldiers began taking over the fight against insurgents in January, and the last of an estimated 115,000 <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> soldiers left Feb. 15, ending nine years of involvement in <LOCATION> Afghaistan </LOCATION>'s civil war. In <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, a rebel spokesman said Afghan rebels and Soviet Embassy officials agreed at talks Monday that rebels held prisoner in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> will be released in exchange for captured <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> soldiers. But an official release from the embassy said final approval must come from the ruling Marxists in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. The spokesman said on condition of anonymity that both sides will exchange lists of prisoners at another round of talks to be held within the next week. But he said the principle of a mass exchange, demanded by insurgents at previous negotiation sessions, was endorsed. The guerrillas say 40,000 rebels are missing in action. No number was given for Soviet prisoners. Local authorities in <LOCATION> Peshawar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, meanwhile said one person was killed Monday and three people were seriously hurt when a medium-range Scud missile, presumably fired from <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, hit Pakistani territory less than a mile from the border. More than 3 million Afghan war refugees live in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, most of them in camps near the border. When Soviet military forces were in the country, <LOCATION> Afghan </LOCATION> soldiers joined them in military operations but rarely acted alone. Moslem insurgents began fighting after a coup in April 1978 and the Soviets entered the war in December 1979. <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said he did not have guerrilla casualties since Jan. 20, but he said at least 12,000 had been killed in the battle for <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> alone. Guerrillas began attacking the city March 6. On Monday, <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said the government had effective control of <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, which 75 miles east of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> and 45 miles from the border. Most of the guerrillas are based in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and receive support from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. According to <PERSON> Amani </PERSON>, the guerrillas fired more than 337,000 rockets and artillery shells in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> during the period covered by the report, including 136,140 at <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> refuses to reveal the size of the army, but diplomats estimate it has about 80,000 men. <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> also reported that photojournalist <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, accused of entering the country illegally and held by Afghan police, was in good health and saw <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> news magazines on Monday for the first time in 19 days. He said that <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> bureau chief of <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, brought magazines and novels for the 42-year-old free-lance journalist, who was on assignment for <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said Afghan troops captured <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> on June 8, not June 14 as reported earlier, in <LOCATION> Wardak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Province </LOCATION> next to <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> He said <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> was found in rebel company. Police have yet to charge <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>, nor have they allowed <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> or others to meet him. Afghan authorities say they are awaiting the arrival of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomat from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> in the case. They said he could not come to <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> on Monday because of air transportation difficulties.

 The same pumps used to evacuate oil from the <LOCATION> Exxon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> were clearing out the World Prodigy off <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> Monday as the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> found itself dealing with four major oil spills. Officials said a response system that is under review as a result of the March 24 Alaskan spill appears to be working well in handling smaller oil spills in <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. No equipment or personnel had to be moved from <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> for the latest spills, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Pascoe </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>'s environmental response branch <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> is paying thousands of workers to clean up oil in the 10-million-gallon Alaskan spill. In each of the latest spills, local <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> officials were overseeing the cleanup, said <PERSON> Pascoe </PERSON>. But a strike force used in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and based in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> was at work with its pumping equipment in <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Narragansett </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> where the World Prodigy ran aground Friday and spilled 420,000 gallons of processed heating oil, <PERSON> Pascoe </PERSON> said. The high-velocity pumps purged the Exxon Valdez of its remaining 40 million gallons of oil a few days after it ran aground in Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>. The World Prodigy retained about 6 million gallons, which was being pumped into barges. <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guardsmen </ORGANIZATION> and private contractor employees were scooping up blobs of oil from an estimated 800,000-gallon spill from a Uraguayan tanker Saturday in the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. But Coast Guard officials said shoreline damage downriver in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> nd <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> was almost nonexistent because the oil was thick and was not washing up on the shore. In <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> was investigating a collision Friday between the tanker Rachel-B and a barge owned by <ORGANIZATION> Coastal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Towing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. Most of the area affected by that spill was industrial. <PERSON> Pascoe </PERSON> said it was too early for the Alaskan spill to have much impact on the way the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> or other agencies respond to spills. But he noted that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is considering several measures to deal with spills in the wake of the Alaskan disaster, and the oil industry last week announced its own plans for a coordinated response. <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> units throughout the country also are conducting a six-month review of their contingency plans for oil spills. The review is to be completed in the fall. <PERSON> Pascoe </PERSON> said the fact the reviews are under way may have heightened the response of officials to the latest spills, but he said there have been no policy or operational changes since the Alaskan spill.

 More than 40 years after being found in the <LOCATION> Qumran </LOCATION> caves, many of the Dead Sea Scrolls remain a mystery, largely because the few scholars with exclusive access have failed to make their findings public. Other scholars are clamoring to have a look, and Israeli authorities have laid down a deadline of 1996 to see all the documents in print. `` It's true that scholars have been dragging their feet for the past 40 years. It's an absolute scandal,'' said <PERSON> Magen </PERSON> <PERSON> Broshi </PERSON>, curator of the Shrine of the Book where about eight of the 800 scrolls are on permanent display. The bimonthly <ORGANIZATION> Biblical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archaeology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION>, published in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, has carried two articles questioning the delays and saying scholars were unfairly blocked from access to both the original manuscripts and photographs. Editor <PERSON> Hershel </PERSON> <PERSON> Shanks </PERSON> wrote that the team of scholars originally given exclusive rights to research by <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and later by the government of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> `` has now become more an obstacle to publication than a source of information.'' Shanks called for opening the materials to research by `` any scholar who so wishes.'' One angry scholar is <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenman </PERSON>, professor of religion at <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. He said he was denied permission to conduct carbon-14 dating tests on the scrolls and was barred from looking for a Bible passage in <LOCATION> Isaiah </LOCATION> that he needed to support a theory. `` Manuscripts of crucial importance are jealously guarded by small group of scholars,'' <PERSON> Eisenman </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` We have research to do ... and we are tried of waiting and want to know what's in the scrolls in our lifetime.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Strugnell </PERSON>, a professor at <ORGANIZATION> Havard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Divinity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> and the new editor-in-chief of the scroll project that involves about 20 scholars, said he tries to accommodate as many outside requests as possible. `` My general inclination is to facilitate requests. But my problem is to get the scrolls published, not satisfy the vanities of particular scholars,'' said <PERSON> Strugnell </PERSON>, who is based in a chamber in a church at the French-run Ecole Biblique in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Strugnell </PERSON>, who predicted the scroll project would be completed by the end of the century, noted a series of Greek papyri found in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> 100 years ago was still not fully published. He demonstrated the difficulty of the work by displaying a photograph of a still-undeciphered manuscript in which tiny fragments of Hebrew letters dotted the plate. `` Maybe the one big mistake was deciding in the beginning to publish every detail,'' he said. <PERSON> Shanks </PERSON> said the 1996 target date set by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Antiquities </ORGANIZATION> was a `` hoax and a fraud'' because it did not say what would happen if scholars failed to meet deadlines. But <PERSON> Amir </PERSON> <PERSON> Drori </PERSON>, the antiquities chief and a former army general, said he set up a program to require annual progress reports and got the scholars to agree on publishing all their finds in seven years. He said fewer than half of the scrolls had been published. To speed the process, <PERSON> Drori </PERSON> said, scholars had been urged to share the workload with students and other researchers, and a special study program has been set up by <ORGANIZATION> Hebrew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> for leading Bible scholars next fall. A $ 350,000 grant from an offshoot of the <PERSON> Wolfson </PERSON> foundation has also been obtained. `` For the first time, we have a plan, and if someone does not complete his work on time we have the right to deliver the scrolls to someone else,'' said <PERSON> Drori </PERSON>, the former commander of troops in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> during <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 1982-85 invasion. <PERSON> Drori </PERSON> defended the decision to close the doors to some scholars, saying free access was unfair to those `` who have devoted their life'' to the research. <PERSON> Drori </PERSON> was interviewed at his office in the Rockefeller Museum, where the leather parchment manuscripts are kept in air-conditioned aluminum boxes in the cellar. The review said some scroll fragments `` are deteriorating so rapidly that if the outside world can not see them soon, it may never be able to see them.'' <PERSON> Broshi </PERSON>, who oversees conservation, dismissed the allegation as `` absolute rubbish,'' adding that only about 1 percent of the manuscript collection had deteriorated beyond repair. Other scholars with access to the scrolls put the figure as high as 5 percent but said the care is good. Discovered by Bedouin nomads in the caves overlooking the <LOCATION> Dead </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> in 1947, excavations uncoverd the documents from 11 caves in a 10-year span. The scrolls include some of the earliest copies of the books of the Bible as well as poetry and legal texts. Scholars say they provide an insight into the life of the ancient Essene sect of Jews as well as the roots of Christianity. `` The Dead Sea scrolls provide a missing link between Christian and Judaism. They help us understand how <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> arrived at some of the teachings he preached. Certainly there is a similarity between his teachings and this sect,'' said <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, deputy director of the Rockefeller Museum.

 Opponents called Monday's <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decisions upholding the death penalty for retarded killers and some teen-age murderers appalling and tragic, but law enforcement officials hailed the rulings as a victory in the fight against violent crime. `` It is quite appalling that the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> would read the Constitution ... as not banning the execution of children,'' said <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwarzschild </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. `` To let society hang children is medieval and barbaric.'' However, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowan </PERSON> said he found the decisions on juvenile killers gratifying. `` In an era of growing concern over the increase and seriousness of violent crime, the court's decision ... reaffirms that state legislators, the juvenile justice system and local juries _ not the federal courts _ can and should decide upon the proper age to impose the death penalty,'' <PERSON> Cowan </PERSON> said. `` Clearly, some 16 - and 17-year-olds in our society are fully mature and capable of plotting and carrying out the most heinous of crimes,'' he said `` The court has obviously responded to society's demand to hold youths who are mature enough to commit horrible crimes responsible for their actions. The court said the Constitution's ban on `` cruel and unusual punishment'' does not prohibit the death penalty for murderers as young as 16, or for retarded adults with the reasoning capacity of young children. The court upheld the death sentences of a <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> murderer who was 17 when he killed and a <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> killer who was 16, as well as a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> killer who has the mental capacity of a 7-year-old. `` It now falls to state legislatures to assure that no individual with this disability is ever put to death in this country,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> on Mental Retardation. `` The execution of any such person would represent a tragic injustice.'' <PERSON> Schwarzschild </PERSON> said `` the execution of people who are not fully responsible for their acts is an atrocity.'' <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Raven </PERSON> said his organization was gravely concerned about the court's decision on juvenile killers. `` To give up, with ultimate finality, upon a person even before they emerge from childhood ... is squarely in opposition to the fundamental premises of an enlightened juvenile justice system,'' <PERSON> Raven </PERSON> said. But Missouri Attorney General <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>, whose office successfully argued in favor of letting states impose the death penalty on murderers who committed their crimes while 16 or 17, took issue with such concerns. `` I think that's hogwash,'' <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> said. `` There's a lot of people that say it's going to open the door. That's ludicrous.''

<HEAD>Bush Tells Ex-Democrats ``the Switch Is On'' to the Republican Party</HEAD>

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told five dozen ex-Democrats at a party Monday for new Republican officials that `` the switch is on'' to the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> while the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is moving `` to the left and out of the mainstream.'' The officials got handshakes from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, duly recorded by a <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> photographer, as part of a celebration that <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> chairman, called his `` proudest single moment'' in office. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> looked at the state legislators, aldermen, judges, sheriffs and other officeholders who had crossed political lines and pronounced himself well pleased. `` The switch is on to the party in sync with the American principles,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` The switch is on to the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>.'' On this sweltering afternoon, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was having none of the bipartisanship, the `` extended hand,'' that he so often stresses in dealings with the Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. It was back to the hard-hitting, anti-liberalism he successfully hammered Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> with in last year's campaign. `` People say the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is on the move. ... That's true We're moving in the right direction. But the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is on the move, too, to the left and out of the mainstream,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. He quoted `` the greatest former Democrat of them all,'' <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who has said that `` I did n't leave the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The Democratic Party left me.'' Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, the congressman who announced his switch to the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> at the White House in February, told the others: `` You did n't come here because it was an easy road. I know you went through period of great self-doubt, ambivalence even before you changed your party registration.'' `` You're tough,'' he said. `` You're being accused of being a traitor, turncoat, accused of betraying the voters by leaving the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>,'' he added. <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> said that `` this is a great day for our party. We've had 118 elected officials and party officials switch from the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to our party since my chairmanship began,'' while `` I know of no single example of a <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> official or elected official who has switched the other way.'' All but a handful of the switchers were from the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, and most made their move this spring. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Evers </PERSON>, outgoing longtime mayor of <LOCATION> Fayette </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, and brother of civil rights martyr <PERSON> Medgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Evers </PERSON>, said he switched because `` I do n't like to be with losers. The <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is a loser'' and it `` took us for granted.''

<HEAD>Savimbi Says Cease-Fire Holding</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> rebel leader <PERSON> Jonas </PERSON> <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> appeared before thousands of cheering supporters Monday and said the cease-fire is holding in the civil war and that more peace talks are planned this week. <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> said at his bush headquarters in southeastern <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> that he believes a national unity government can be established by the end of the year, although he set no firm date. `` I am confident the negotiations will bear fruit,'' he said of talks planned this week in <LOCATION> Kinshasa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>, between the Western-backed <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla movement and the Marxist government of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. `` The Angolan people want peace ... and the <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> delegation is prepared to be flexible,'' he said. <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> denied reports that he consented to go into foreign exile. He said he will remain in his homeland as leader of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> for the Total Independence of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, known by its Portuguese acronym, <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION>. `` A person goes into exile after he's been defeated,'' he said. `` I plan to stay right here.'' Thousands of rebel soldiers and civilian supporters sang, danced and waved red-and-green paper replicas of the guerrilla flag at a parade to celebrate the cease-fire, declared Thursday at a 20-nation African summit in <LOCATION> Gbadolite </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>. `` The spirit of the cease-fire can be considered as holding,'' <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> said. He said isolated skirmishes could break out due to the difficulty of contacting all combatants, but he said he thinks the truce will last. The summit was the first meeting between <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> since the battle for power broke out in 1975 shortly after <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> gained independence from <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>. The guerrilla movement controls areas in southeastern <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> occupied by up to 3 million of the country's 9 million people. <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> and <PERSON> dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> sealed the accord with a handshake and agreed to more talks. Since the handshake, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> radio has referred to <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> as `` <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> president,'' rather than its previous description of him as a `` traitor'' and `` bandit leader.'' <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>, meanwhile, said the rebel radio now refers to <PERSON> dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> as `` president'' rather than `` caudillo,'' the <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> word for `` tyrant'' or `` dictator.'' <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> praised <PERSON> dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> for his `` bravery'' in agreeing to the talks with <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION>. `` I want President <PERSON> dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> to succeed,'' <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> said. `` I know he needs time.'' <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> said he expected talks between the two sides in <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> and possibly another <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> summit to review the process in August or September. The Angolan government said during the weekend that the cease-fire was holding. <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION>'s chief of intelligence, Gen. <PERSON> Wambu </PERSON> <PERSON> Chindondo </PERSON>, said the rebels declared a halt to offensives in February and that the guerrilla movement had no difficulty abiding by the cease-fire. He said the combined Angolan-Cuban forces appeared to be preparing for attacks but there were no major battles in recent weeks. The Angolan civil war has claimed tens of thousands of lives, and involved several foreign governments including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. In a dispatch from <LOCATION> Luanda </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> news agency <ORGANIZATION> Lusa </ORGANIZATION> quoted unidentified diplomatic and military sources as saying the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> pressured <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> to attend the <LOCATION> Gbadolite </LOCATION> summit and accept the Angolan peace plan. According to <ORGANIZATION> Lusa </ORGANIZATION>, the sources said <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> at first refused because of `` internal discord'' within <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sese </PERSON> <PERSON> Seko </PERSON> was `` obliged to contact <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>, in order to ensure the success of the summit.'' The cease-fire follows U.S.-brokered regional peace accords <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> signed in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in December with <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Under the accords, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> agreed to allow <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s southern neighbor, <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, independence under a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> plan and halt aid to <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>'s guerrillas. In exchange, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> agreed to a phased withdrawal of its estimated 50,000 troops backing dos <PERSON> Santos </PERSON>' government <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> was not party to the agreement.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Rezsoe </PERSON> <PERSON> Nyers </PERSON> said Monday he and the other three members of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s new collective leadership will work together for `` unambiguous reform.'' <PERSON> Nyers </PERSON>, the new party chairman, said the four leaders chosen over the weekend have equal responsibility, but in matters of party policy he is `` first among equals.'' Creation of the four-man presidium by the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> appears to strengthen the reform wing and limit the power of <PERSON> Karoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>, the party general secretary, who also is a member. <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>, who replaced longtime party chief <PERSON> Janos </PERSON> <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> 13 months ago, has resisted numerous demands from reformers that he resign. Also on the new leadership team are <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON>, the party's leading reformer, and reform-minded Premier <PERSON> Miklos </PERSON> <PERSON> Nemeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Nyers </PERSON>, <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nemeth </PERSON> insisted at a news conference Monday that each of the four had equal power. `` It is not a mathematical formula of three plus one,'' <PERSON> Nyers </PERSON> said in a clear reference to the reformers and <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>. `` It is not a question of where we've been, but where we are going. The party wishes to become a more unambiguous reform party.'' He said the party had chosen to dissociate itself from `` extremes.'' <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON> said: `` A real compromise was achieved. The important matter is the unity of views, and not the differences.'' He said peaceful transition to `` democratic socialism'' and a multiparty system should not lead to a `` power vacuum.'' `` A country should not run loose,'' <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON> declared. `` It is important to govern.'' Prominent members have expressed concern that a split might cause the party to disintegrate. <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON> has said repeatedly that none of the political groups springing up in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> is ready to assume power. <PERSON> Nemeth </PERSON> said, `` It would be wrong to define unity by the former criteria,'' under which the leadership presented a unifed platform. `` Everyone is a boss in some way'' in the new presidium, he said. As <PERSON> Nyers </PERSON> explained it, <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> would be responsible for the entire party apparatus and <PERSON> Nyers </PERSON>, the chairman, would handle the party's domestic and foreign relations <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON> has been proposed as the party candidate for president of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> when the post is created. The new presidency would have far greater powers than the current ceremonial office. In the new leadership `` everyone supports reform,'' <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> told the news conference, with debate centering on the type of reform and the pace at which it should occur.

<TEXT>
 Soviet dissident <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> said Monday that trimming the Soviet military and halving enlisted men's service time would have `` a colossal effect for world disarmament. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> said the number of Soviet army officers should be reduced at a slower rate `` with the view of setting up an all-professional army.'' He told reporters at the <ORGANIZATION> Nobel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> that arms reduction should be <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s major foreign policy priority. The institute is home of the committee that awarded him the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, 68, arrived from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> on Sunday for his first visit here since winning the prize for his human rights activities. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> said the Soviets were being `` pragmatic'' in their guarded response to the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> government's crushing of the Chinese democracy movement and the death sentences for Chinese students. He pulled a paper from his pocket that he said was a telegram he sent to world leaders.

<HEAD>Text of Wright's Statement on Decision to Quit and Not Seek Re-Election</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Wright</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Here is a text of former Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s statement on his decision to resign his <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> seat effective Friday and not seek re-election Since announcing that I would retire from the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> at the end of this month, I have received thousands of written and verbal requests from people in my district imploring me to reconsider. Some have spoken of writing my name in on the special election ballot, and some others even have begun circulating petitions to place my name on the ballot. Naturally I have been moved by such gracious and spontaneous expressions of support. I did not encourage these entreaties, but out of profound respect and affection for the wonderful people who have been coming to me, I did not peremptorily dismiss their ideas. I heard them out. As deeply as I appreciate the devoted friendship which impels these sincere petitions, I must conclude that I was right in announcing my retirement from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Independent polling data have made it very clear that I could be re-elected. These demonstrations of strong bipartisan support are truly gratifying, but I feel that I probably have done as much good as I can do in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> at the present time and should look to the next phase of my life. It is best for the institution and best for the people whom I've served that I step aside now and make room for others Thirty-four and a half years is a very long time, and I have been richly blessed. To seek and gain the splendid honor of a public endorsement one more time would be vainglorious. To do so without intending to serve for a prolonged period would be pointless. To postpone the moment when another may begin would be a disservice. I do not foreclose the possibility that at some future time and some other way I may again be of service to our nation, but not in elective office. As for now <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> and I are ready to enjoy a period of private life. I will not be inactive, but I hope to be selective and pursue a slightly less hectic pace than at present. I have received perhaps 65 or 70 speaking invitations, for example, and have accepted five or six. I am also considering some limited business and professional relationships and some invitations to write. I will have an office in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>. If I should live to be 100, I shall never cease to be grateful to the people of my area and to my colleagues in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> who have made it possible for me to do whatever good I've been able to do for our country and to have the joy of doing it.

<HEAD>Justice Minister Says Deportations Can Help Put Down Uprising</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: SUBS 2nd graf to ADD first reference to Meridor.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The justice minister Monday said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> should deport more Palestinians to help crush the revolt in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Meridor </PERSON>'s suggestion is among tougher measures to handle the 18-month uprising proposed by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials and criticized by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and human rights organizations. `` I think deportation is serious but must be used, I would say perhaps even more that what has been done until now,'' <PERSON> Meridor </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think it's an effective punishment when we have appropriate evidence,'' he said. Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> has recommended speeding up deportation procedures as well as demolishing more homes of Palestinians suspected of anti-Israeli activities and lengthening the term security suspects can be detained without trial from six months to one year. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and human rights organizations say all three methods ignore international conventions on the treatment of people in occupied lands and violate due process of law because suspects have no chance to go to court. The justice and defense ministries Sunday set up a joint committee to devise tougher measures to put down the uprising. <PERSON> Meridor </PERSON> told the radio about 50 Palestinians have been deported since the start of the uprising and nearly 300 houses have been demolished or sealed. Also Monday, the body of a woman suspected of cooperating with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities was found in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. She had been beaten to death, they said. Palestinians said <PERSON> Sabah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khadi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kanaan </PERSON>, 30, had been accused of collaborating with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s secret police, but an army spokesman said police believe the killing was criminal. Ms. <PERSON> Kanaan </PERSON> was the 68th suspected collaborator killed by Palestinians since the uprising began in December 1987. The unrest has killed 536 Palestinians and 23 Israelis. A suspected collaborator killed Sunday initially was identified by <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reporters as <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> <PERSON> Salhab </PERSON>, 21, but police Monday said <PERSON> Salhab </PERSON>'s father reported his son was alive. The victim's head had been crushed, and police said they still are trying to determine his identity. Meanwhile, Sen. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Hawaii </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> must present a united front on its peace plan. `` Though it may be difficult and painful, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> must declare and demonstrate to one and all, friendly and unfriendly, that she is not divided and that her mission of peace is sincere and real,'' <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON> said, speaking at a <ORGANIZATION> Hebrew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> graduation ceremony. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> has proposed holding elections in the occupied lands to select <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> representatives to open negotiations on an interim peace agreement with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Hard-liners in his right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc oppose the plan, saying it could lead to formation of a Palestinian state. <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON> also said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should stand behind <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` This is a time of testing for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, testing whether we are prepared to take this important step in the pathways of peace, and we must not fail,'' <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Fransie </PERSON> <PERSON> Geringer </PERSON> enjoyed himself Monday, but at age 16 he knows he may not make it to the next annual reunion of victims of progeria, the fatal syndrome that turns children old before their time. The shrunken, pinch-faced South African, one of the 16 known victims of the condition, praised the reunions in a soft, shy voice as he visited Sea World marine park. `` I get to my see my friends,'' said <PERSON> Geringer </PERSON>, who suffered a series of heart attacks in recent months and had to drop out of school. `` It may be the last time.'' Progeria sufferers and their families from <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are enjoying themselves at <ORGANIZATION> Sea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> and a nearby ranch. The reunion for the youngsters, who range in age from 4 to 19, began June 23 and runs through Friday. Progeria, with a reported incidence of up to 1 in 8 million births, is characterized by what appears to be rapid aging, dwarfism, baldness and distortion of joints and faces. Most sufferers die before they turn 20. The cause is unknown. <PERSON> Geringer </PERSON>'s journey from <LOCATION> Brakpan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Disneyland </ORGANIZATION> in 1981 and his meeting there with three other victims of the genetic syndrome made the world aware of the syndrome Two of the other three have died, but <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Hays </PERSON>, 17, faces his plight with bravado, saying he's a `` tough little Texan'' who's like anyone else. `` There's nothing wrong with me,'' said the <LOCATION> Longview </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, teen-ager. `` I do what I like _ fishing, working on a race car with my friend. ... I left school in the eighth grade. Do n't need it.'' The gatherings have been sponsored since 1982 by the Philadelphia-based <ORGANIZATION> Sunshine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, which grants the wishes of terminally ill children. The number of progeria sufferers has remained about 16 for several years, said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Sample </PERSON>, the former <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> police officer who founded the organization. `` About the time we add one, we lose one,'' said Sample. `` This reunion is critically important _ to the kids, the parents especially. But to the medical community, too,'' Sample said. The annual gatherings may eventually lead to treatment, even prevention, if researchers succeed in isolating the genetic breakdown that causes the problem, said Drs. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> and <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> DeBusk </PERSON>, who have been studying progeria for the past eight years. `` It has not been possible for any one doctor to see more than one or two of these children at one time anywhere in the world,'' said <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. `` Doctor <PERSON> DeBusk </PERSON> and I have been fortunate in having reunions such as this.'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, a geneticist at <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> who began studying progeria in 1974, said he believes it's caused by a cell defect that prevents normal absorption and elimination of a substance called hyaluronic acid from the body. He believes he can prove his theory in about two years. <PERSON> DeBusk </PERSON>, who is with the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION>'s pediatrics department, estimated there have been about 100 cases of progeria in the world since it was first reported in 1866. Some researchers say it appears in one out of 8 million births, others say one in 4 million. Some cases are not reported, and some are not properly identified before the victims die. Some victims' parents deny their children have it, <PERSON> DeBusk </PERSON> said. `` I'm sure there have to be many others,'' he said.

 Here are excerpts from Monday's <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decisions upholding the death penalty for convicted murderers as young as 16 and for mentally retarded killers. From Justice <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON>'s majority opinion in the juvenile-killers cases: Petitioners are correct in asserting that this court has not confined the prohibition embodied in the Eight Amendment -LRB- banning cruel and unusual punishment -RRB- to `` barbarous'' methods that were generally outlawed in the 18th century, but instead has interpreted the amendment in a flexible and dynamic manner. In determining what standards have evolved, however, we have looked not to our own conceptions of decency, but to those of modern <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> society as a whole. ... We emphasize that it is American conceptions of decency that are dispositive, rejecting the contention of petitioners and their various amici -LRB- organizations filing friend-of-the-court briefs -RRB- that the sentencing practices of other countries are relevant. First among the objective indicia that reflect the public attitude toward a given sanction are statutes passed by society's elected representatives Of the 37 states whose laws permit capital punishment, 15 decline to impose it upon 16-year-old offenders and 12 decline to impose it on 17-year-old offenders. This does not establish the degree of national consensus this court has previously thought sufficient to label a particular punishment cruel and unusual. From Justice <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>'s concurring opinion: It is sufficiently clear that no national consensus forbids the imposition of capital punishment on 16 - or 17-year-old capital murderers I am unable, however, to join the remainder of -LRB- Scalia's -RRB- opinion -LRB- which in part -RRB- emphatically rejects the suggestion that, beyond an assessment of the specific enactments of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> legislatures, there remains a constitutional obligation imposed upon this court to judge whether the nexus between the punishment imposed and the defendant's blameworthiness is proportional. In my view, this court does have a constitutional obligation to conduct proportional analysis. From Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>'s dissenting opinion: I believe that to take the life of a person as punishment for a crime committed when below the age of 18 is cruel and unusual, and hence is prohibited by the Eighth Amendment. Together, the rejection of the death penalty for juveniles by a majority of the states, the rarity of the sentence for juveniles ... the decisions of respected organizations in relevant fields that this punishment is unacceptable, and its rejection generally throughout the world provide to my mind a strong grounding for the view that it is not constitutionally tolerable that certain states persist in authorizing the execution of adolescent offenders. From <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>'s controlling opinion in the death penalty for retarded killers ruling: Mental retardation is a factor that may well lessen a defendant's culpability for a capital offense But we can not conclude today that the Eighth Amendment precludes the execution of any mentally retarded person of -LRB- <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Penry </PERSON>'s ability convicted of a capital offense simply by virtue of their mental retardation alone. So long as sentencers can consider and give effect to mitigating evidence of mental retardation in imposing sentence, an individualized determination of whether death is the appropriate punishment can be made in each particular case. While a national consensus against execution of the mentally retarded may someday emerge reflecting the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society, there is insufficient evidence of such a consensus today. From <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>'s opinion, concurring in part and dissenting in part: I agree that the jury instructions given at sentencing in this case deprived petitioner of his constitutional right to have a jury consider all mitigating evidence that he presented before sentencing him to die. I would also hold, however, that the Eighth Amendment prohibits the execution of offenders who are mentally retarded and who thus lack the full degree of responsibility for their crimes that is a predicate for the constitutional imposition of the death penalty. From Justice <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>' opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part: -LRB- Justice <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON>'s opinion -RRB- adequately and fairly states the competing arguments respecting capital punishment of mentally retarded persons. In my judgment, however, that explication _ particularly the summary of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> on Mental Retardation and other amici curiae -LRB- friends of the court -RRB- _ compels the conclusion that such executions are unconstitutional. From <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON>'s opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part: In holding that the jury had to be free to deem <PERSON> Penry </PERSON>'s mental retardation and sad childhood relevant for whatever purpose it wished, the court has come full circle, not only permitting but requiring what -LRB- the court -RRB- once condemned. `` freakishly'' and `` wantonly'' have been rebaptized `` reasoned moral response.''

<HEAD>Chicago Merc Should Do Better Policing Job, Says CFTC Staff</HEAD>

 The <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> and other futures markets should do a better job of cracking down on high-pressure telephone sales tactics at member firms, the staff of the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. The staff report praised the exchange for responding to earlier suggestions for improvement, but said more needs to be done to ensure that `` investigative procedures adequately address the issue of detecting abusive oral sales representations.'' One of the biggest complaints of securities and futures customers after the October 1987 stock market crash was that they had been talked into making unsuitably speculative investments without being properly warned of the risks. The staff of the commission, which regulates futures markets, praised the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> for starting a program of interviewing customers to make sure futures brokers do n't use sale pitches designed to override risk disclosure documents provided to customers. However, it said the exchange should routinely conduct the interviews in a more systematic and timely fashion. Specifically, the commission staff said the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> did a poor job of investigating a particular firm, which it did not identify, that had attracted an unusual number of customer complaints. `` The -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- Division -LRB- of Trading and Markets -RRB- believes that the exchange's investigation was not concluded -LRB- in a -RRB- timely -LRB- manner -RRB- and should have included certain additional procedures'' such as an attempt to uncover high pressure sales tactics,'' the agency's report said It also said that the exchange's requirement that most actions by staff investigators be authorized by an internal committee `` may unnecessarily prolong an investigation.'' <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yemma </PERSON>, a spokesman for the exchange, said the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> disagreed with the commission's assessment of that particular investigation. `` We believe our efforts were timely and thorough and we will attempt to bridge this gap with the <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. However, he said the exchange intends to adopt a commission suggestion that it work more closely with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and will adopt an invesigatory technique used by the association. The association sometimes has its investigators pose as customers as a way of uncovering sales abuses. In another recommendation, the commission said the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION>'s member firms should do a better job of supervising sales personnel who were hired away from other firms that got into trouble with regulators. `` Members of the -LRB- Mercantile -RRB- and of other exchanges as well have employed, and in some cases even, recruited ... -LRB- employees -RRB- of firms subject to commission enforcement proceedings or disciplinary actions for sales violations,'' the report said. <PERSON> Yemma </PERSON> said the Mercantile would adopt the recommended procedures for monitoring such employees. In general, he said the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> believes the commission report was favorable. For instance, it praises the exchange for more than doubling its audit staff from 16 in May 1985 to 35 in January 1988. Futures markets regulation has become a particular focus of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> since the disclosure in February that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> had conducted a two-year undercover investigation of alleged abuses. Members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are questioning whether futures exchanges' self-regulation system is working and whether the commission is providing effective oversight of the system. The legislative scrutiny will likely come to a head this fall because <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> must reauthorize the commission before Sept. 30 or the agency will go out of business.

<TEXT>
 Tropical Storm <PERSON> Allison </PERSON>, the first named storm of the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> hurricane season, swept ashore south of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> on Monday with wind gusts of 65 mph and torrential rain that inundated roads in coastal towns. A tugboat was capsized, a barge was driven aground and roofs were damaged. Landfall came near <LOCATION> Freeport </LOCATION>, about 60 miles south of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, with the storm packing a sustained wind speed of 50 mph and weather forecasters predicting as much as 15 inches of rain in the next 24 hours. The National Hurricane Center in <LOCATION> Coral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gables </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, said tropical storm-force wind extended as far as 150 miles to the east of the center of the storm. Little change in the storm's strength was expected Monday. A tropical storm warning was in effect from <LOCATION> Freeport </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Morgan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Allison </PERSON> had been a slow-moving tropical depression but was upgraded to a tropical storm Monday morning after its sustained wind speed reached 39 mph. `` It has a poorly defined center,'' weather service meteorologist <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Vannozzi </PERSON> said. `` There probably will be some minor wind damage. The main thing is the rain. It's a heavy rainmaker.'' Forecasters warned that 10 to 15 inches of rain was possible over eastern <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and southwestern <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> as large bands of rain moved onshore. The heavy rain prompted the weather service to issue a flash flood watch for much of the southeastern <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> coast and a flash flood warning for <LOCATION> Brazoria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION> counties, south of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, and parts of <LOCATION> Harris </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. Some areas of <LOCATION> Brazoria </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> had received more than 10 inches of rain in the previous couple of days, and that amount also was expected for parts of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, weather service meteorologist <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapa </PERSON> said. `` It should weaken after it goes ashore, but it'll take a while,'' <PERSON> Chapa </PERSON> said. The storm was blamed for capsizing a tugboat in <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> and sending a benzene-bearing barge aground in the <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> Ship Channel. Three people escaped serious injury and the barge was not believed to be damaged, <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. `` It may be able to ride out the storm aground,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. `` These are fairly soft and sandy bars and reefs so maybe it wo n't be a problem. Tides ranged from 3 to 5 feet above normal, <PERSON> Chapa </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION>, the rain and high tides pushed <LOCATION> Highland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bayou </LOCATION> out of its banks along a highway, submerging cars in more than 4 feet of water. On <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, some residents with beach homes on the west end reported a foot of water in their yards, weather service specialist <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Cage </PERSON> said. A torn-off roof and a damaged garage were possibly caused by a tornado, Ms. <PERSON> Cage </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Brazoria </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, residents in the small island community of <LOCATION> Quintana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> were advised to evacuate because rising water threatened to close the area's swing bridge. `` We're telling them if they want to get out, they'd better get out now,'' Chief Deputy <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> said of the <LOCATION> Brazoria </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff's <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Brazoria </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Emergency Management Coordinator <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> McCann </PERSON> also advised residents of low-lying areas to seek higher ground. The weather service reported some roads were closed in the <LOCATION> Kemah-Seabrook </LOCATION> area and near the <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> Ship Channel, which was closed by tides 5 feet above mean sea level. Some roads in the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> area, north of <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION>, also were closed by high water, as were some Houston-area freeway feeder roads. <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lighting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> reported 30,000 customers were without electricity. The <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Clear </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> was among several schools to cancel Monday night classes. The storm had its origins in Hurricane Cosme, which moved from the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> across <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> last week.

 A recess was reported Monday in talks with <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> aimed at ending mistrust rooted in the German invasion that began World War II, but the government would not say whether progress had been made. Negotiations began six months ago on an exchange of West German economic aid to communist <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> Polish recognition of its German minority. Agreement would play a symbolic role in easing relations. A West German government spokesman, who demanded anonymity, confirmed the latest round had ended, but said `` we can not release details at this time.'' He refused to say whether agreement was near on a visit to <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> this year by Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>. West German officials had hoped the latest talks would open the way for a visit and presage reconciliation between the two countries. Negotiations `` are to be taken up again soon'' but he did not know whether a date had been set, the spokesman said. <PERSON> Horst </PERSON> <PERSON> Teltschik </PERSON>, one of <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s main advisers, met in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> for most of the day with <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Kucza </PERSON>, head of the foreign affairs department of the <ORGANIZATION> Polish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Suedwestfunk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> said `` the talks were broken off'' and `` no new date has yet been set'' for resumption. Lack of progress in relations with <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> has been a foreign policy disappointment for <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, who has built on <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s earlier agreements with other Soviet bloc countries <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> seeks recognition of language rights for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s German minority and other improvements in conditions for the ethnic Germans <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> wants help for its crippled economy.

 The forced exodus of Turks from <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> demonstrates a systematic denial of basic human rights by the Bulgarian government, the White House said Monday. `` We deplore <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>'s blatant violations of the human rights of its citizens,'' presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said in a statement. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said about 60,000 Turks had `` either fled or been forcibly expelled'' and had migrated to <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> in the last month, `` many with nothing more than the clothes on their backs.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has urged <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> `` to cease these violations and to allow for the orderly emigration of those ethnic Turks who desire to leave,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>'s statement said. Restraints on Bulgarians of Turkish descent, including forbidding the use of the Turkish language, sparked riots throughout the country last month in which 30 people were reported killed. The Bulgarian government began deporting ethnic Turks on May 26. There are an estimated 1 million Bulgarians of Turkish descent. They are Moslems, while the majority of Bulgarians are <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION>.

 A Soviet nuclear submarine caught fire Monday off <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, the second such accident since April, but the Soviets said no radiation was released. <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> complained of a long delay in reporting the accident. Fire began on the Echo II class sub, built in the 1960s, when a reactor broke down 70 miles off the coast, Soviet and Norwegian officials said. The reactor was shut down and there were no casualties, the Soviet <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said. The vessel was bound for the Soviet naval base at <LOCATION> Murmansk </LOCATION> under auxiliary diesel power, accompanied by other Soviet vessels, the ministry said. Adm. <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chernavin </PERSON>, the Soviet navy commander, said on Soviet television Monday evening the submarine's nuclear weapons were safe after the accident and no radioactivity was released. He did not give sub's name. The authoritative British handbook `` <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>'s Fighting Ships'' says Echo II submarines are 380 feet long with crews of 90 and have eight missile silos built for cruise missiles. <PERSON> Johan </PERSON> <PERSON> Joergen </PERSON> <PERSON> Holst </PERSON>, the Norwegian defense minister, said, `` We were not informed by the Soviets but had to find out for ourselves'' about the fire. He would not say how <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> learned of the accident, citing security considerations. Press reports said a radio distress signal from the sub to its base probably was intercepted. <PERSON> Holst </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> would test air and water in the area because `` the information we have is not detailed enough to know if there was a radiation leak.'' In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Soviet claims of no radiation could not be confirmed until tests were completed. Norwegian intellegence learned of the accident at 5 a.m. and air force F-16 fighters confirmed half an hour later that smoke was billowing from it, he said. A cable from the Soviet Foreign Ministry at 10 a.m., responding to an official Norwegian request for information, said the fire started at 4:30 a.m., <PERSON> Holst </PERSON> said. The Norwegian rescue center received word shortly before 10 a.m. that its helicopters and rescue vessels would not be needed. The center cooperates with the <LOCATION> Murmansk </LOCATION> rescue center under a 1988 agreement covering emergencies at sea. In his television interview, <PERSON> Chernavin </PERSON> said the stricken submarine would arrive in <LOCATION> Murmansk </LOCATION> on Thursday. Maj. <PERSON> Gullow </PERSON> <PERSON> Gjeseth </PERSON>, spokesman for <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, said it took <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> more than a day to inform <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, through diplomatic channels, of the sinking April 7 of a Mike-class nuclear submarine, in which 42 sailors died. After the fire Monday, <PERSON> Holst </PERSON> said: `` It is unsatisfactory for us as a neighboring state not to be warned'' immediately about an accident aboard anuclear submarine. `` When two such incidents happen so close together, we can not help but feel uneasy about these vessels close to our waters,'' he said. `` If there are operational problems with nuclear-powered submarines carrying nuclear weapons, then we are uneasy.'' The Soviet cable to the Norwegian Embassy in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> said `` there was a break due to fatigue in the first chamber of the reactor.. which has been shut down.'' It said the sub declined offers of help because `` there are several Soviet vessels in the vicinity.'' <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION>, the Soviet government daily, quoted Defense Minister <PERSON> Dmitri </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> as saying a pipe on a reactor burst and the hermetic seal was broken. Capt. <PERSON> Y. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasatkin </PERSON> took his vessel to the surface and shut down nuclear power, then other Soviet ships provided water to cool the reactor, <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> said. The submarine crew fired a flare and waved off a Norwegian rescue helicopter to indicate the ship did not want help, said <PERSON> Terje </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lien </PERSON>, of the <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> Rescue Coordination Center. Maj. <PERSON> Gjeseth </PERSON> said about 100 nuclear submarines, including 30 of the Echo II class, operate from the Soviet base on the <LOCATION> Kola </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>. It was the third recent accident involving a Soviet vessel. The Soviet cruise ship <PERSON> Maxim </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorky </PERSON> was torn open by ice June 20 near <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Spitzbergen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. No casualties were reported among the 950 people aboard, who were evacuated.

<HEAD>Agrarian Reform Secretary Resigns Over Land Scandal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government's land reform secretary has resigned, but President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said Monday she would not accept the resignation until scandals in his department are investigated. <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Juico </PERSON> said he submitted the resignation Saturday because of allegations of criminal conspiracy in the purchase of an estate in <LOCATION> Camarines </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sur </LOCATION> province for distribution to peasants. The purchase was blocked in December when officials said the government had agreed to pay $ 3 million for land worth only $ 142,000. <PERSON> Juico </PERSON> and 20 department officials went on leave last month after newspapers disclosed the deal. At the time, <PERSON> Juico </PERSON> said he was taking leave so an investigation Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> ordered would not be influenced. After the <ORGANIZATION> Camarines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sur </ORGANIZATION> sale was disclosed, investigators said that in at least two other cases, <PERSON> Juico </PERSON>'s department agreed to pay vastly inflated sums for land. The secretary has denied wrongdoing and said subordinates deceived him. He He said Monday that his resignation was not an admission of guilt.

 <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, criticized earlier this year in a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> audit, was replaced Monday as head of the <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, the department said. Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> announced in a brief statement that he was appointing <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Buck </PERSON>, deputy <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> commissioner, as acting head of the service to replace <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, who resigned. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> declined to say why <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> was being replaced before a permanent successor is found. But a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said officials were concerned about the overall management at <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION>, which was criticized in the audit ordered earlier this year by <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>. Officials were particularly concerned about the agency's budget because <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> _ as a lame duck _ had no incentive to control spending, the source said. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, a holdover from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, has been privately criticized by department officals, who have long signaled that he would be replaced. His resignation has been pending since the start of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration but was not accepted until this weekend, <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> McNary </PERSON>, the chief executive of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, is expected to be nominated by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to fill the post. <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> said senior officials of the agency were not informed of <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s decision to replace <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> with Buck until 10:30 a.m. Monday, about the time the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> issued its public announcement. <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> said <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, who was in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, was first advised last Wednesday that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would be accepting his resignation and was formally informed of the action by telephone on Saturday. The audit said accounting, management and administration were in disarray, citing a growing backlog of cases awaiting adjudication. It also noted that INS Western regional officials had chartered jets to fly to conferences when commercial flights were available. More recently, <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> raised the ire of <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials by approving a trip to the National Sheriff's Association convention in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> of 19 officials of his agency. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> was forced to cancel the trips of all but three or four after the department issued an order `` to curtail the number of attendees traveling'' to conferences and meetings. This episode, the source said, raised concerns in the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> about <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>'s commitment to controlling spending. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> defended his agency against criticisms in the audit, which he called `` grossly deficient.'' The audit noted that the agency had spent $ 1,500 for an oil portrait of <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials were also privately critical of a videotape tribute to <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> that <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> produced at taxpayer expense. In his statement, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> noted that <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> `` has led the <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> through difficult times.'' During his tenure at <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> oversaw the amnesty program for illegal aliens that was enacted by the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act. Rep. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>, D-Conn., who chairs the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> immigration subcomittee, said in a statement that he `` wished Commissioner <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> well'' but added that `` I have long felt that a change in leadership was needed'' at <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> `` But more than new leadership, what is needed is a complete reorganization of the structure if the functions now collected under the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> are to be performed effectively.''

<HEAD>Power Cuts Expanded in Uruguay; General Strike Called</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The state power company said Monday that electricity shutdowns in this capital city of 1.2 million people will be doubled to six hours a day. It put most of the blame on drought. <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>'s biggest labor coalition meanwhile announced it will stage on Tuesday its eighth general strike against the government of President <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanguinetti </PERSON> to press demands for wage and pension increases. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Serrato </PERSON>, president of the state <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transmission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said electricity in <LOCATION> Montevideo </LOCATION> and several other cities will be cut from 5 p.m. to 11 p.m., adding, `` Since records have been kept, there has not been so severe a shortage of rain.'' Much of the electricity in this Oklahoma-sized, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> nation of 3 million comes from hydropower. The lack of rain has idled 13 of the 14 turbines of the Salto Grande complex on the <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, a major power source. For weeks, <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> bought electricity from neighboring <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>. But this week <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, which has been having its own troubles, is scheduled to resume power cuts itself. A bit more than 8 -LCB- inches of rain have fallen this year, <PERSON> Serrato </PERSON> said, less than half the normal amount. Drinking water is being rationed in the small city of <PERSON> Melo </PERSON>. Throughout <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>, grazing land has dried out and water is being trucked in for livestock. The general strike was called by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>, which is demanding a pay increase of about 30 percent starting July 1. The current minimum wage, set in February, is about $ 70 a month. The increase would apply to many of the approximately 260,000 state employees, who make up about one-quarter of the total work force. Private sector companies raised wages by about 25 percent for the March-June period. Inflation for 1989 is projected at 80 percent. Union leaders also want an increase in retirement pensions and oppose proposals to sell state companies which might result in layoffs or higher prices for services.

In April, 20 people were killed in the Georgian capital, <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION>, when troops were called in to quell a pro-democracy demonstration. In other ethnic clashes, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported one more person died Sunday from injuries sustained in the Central Asian republic of <LOCATION> Kazakhstan </LOCATION>, raising the death toll there to five. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said 22 people remain hospitalized. The June 17-20 riots were in the oil production center of Novy Uzen between Kazakhs and settlers from the <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> region.

 Troops launched an operation on Monday to put down a 7-month-old secessionist uprising, burning homes and seizing villagers, according to news reports. The revolt has closed an economically crucial mine of <ORGANIZATION> Bougainville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Copper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> on northern <LOCATION> Bougainville </LOCATION> island. The insurrectionists were reported overnight to have destroyed a power plant at a farm owned by the company. Unrest shut down the mine May 15. Rebel landowners complain it damages the environment and want $ 10 billion in compensation. The pit had been contributing 20 percent of <LOCATION> Papua </LOCATION> <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION>'s total revenue through royalties and taxes. Rebels spurned all attempts at conciliation, ambushing mine workers and soldiers. Three soldiers were killed and about 20 security force members and many civilians were wounded. Under a state of emergency that went into effect Monday, authorities were granted broad powers to search, seize and arrest, and to evacuate people from emergency areas, Australian <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> said. The agency quoted witnesses as reporting houses were set afire and at least two dozen people were taken away by police on Monday, with soldiers blocking the road to the mine and checking all vehicles. It said many residents probably will be evacuated by force from rebel-held areas to isolate secessionist leader <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Ona </PERSON>, a 35-year-old surveyor, and his <ORGANIZATION> Bougainville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s largest mining company, <ORGANIZATION> CRA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, jointly operates the mine, which is about 300 miles northeast of the mainland. Security forces commander Col. <PERSON> Lima </PERSON> <PERSON> Dotaona </PERSON> asked Ona to surrender. He expressed confidence on Sunday that his forces would restore order, but said he expected a drawn-out operation. Prime Minister <PERSON> Rabbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Namaliu </PERSON> said Friday the government could not let a `` criminal minority'' threaten national unity and economic stability. <LOCATION> Papua </LOCATION> <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION>, with 3.5 million people, became independent from <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> in 1975. It lies in the tropics between <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>.

 <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s emerging new leaders must be pressured to quickly end apartheid because `` the time is running out'' for a `` congenial, bloodless'' resolution, Australian Prime Minister <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> said Monday. `` It is the time now for pressure to bring them not to their knees, but to the -LRB- negotiating -RRB- table ... `` <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> said in answer to questions at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> said apartheid will be resolved one way or another and `` the time is running out where the conflict can be resolved in a congenial, bloodless way.'' `` I trust ... that what will be done by the rest of the world is to keep up pressure, but to give the new leadership emerging in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> the opportunity of responding, getting them to understand that only by getting to the negotiating table in the near future are we going to have the opportunity of a resolution of the conflict in a bloodless way,'' he continued. Leaders of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s black resistance movement, the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, and the black frontline countries bordering <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> want a multiracial society in the country, <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> said. They recognize that country's future prosperity depends on keeping the whites, white capital and expertise, he said. But those black leaders `` are running out of time with their younger generations,'' who question such an attitude when it brings no positive response, he added. <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> described as `` silly'' the view of those who said that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic sanctions voted by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> over former President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto failed to have the desired effect.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet negotiators resumed talks Monday on monitoring nuclear tests, and both sides predicted agreement soon. They are drafting new monitoring provisions for two superpower treaties of the 1970s, still not ratified by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, limiting military and other nuclear explosions to 150 kilotons. One kiloton has the force of 1,000 tons of TNT. The bomb dropped on <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, in 1945, originally reckoned at 20 kilotons, had an explosive force of 12 or 13 kilotons. The goal is to get <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> ratification, which was withheld because of concern that the limits could not be enforced. Talks resumed after a six-month recess caused, in part, by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration review of arms control and security policy. Monday's meeting was held at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Mission in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, between delegation chiefs <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Igor </PERSON> <PERSON> Palenykh </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> has said the purpose of the new negotiations, expected to last five to six weeks, is to produce complete agreements. <PERSON> Palenykh </PERSON> said there is `` a good basis for reaching practical results within a short time.'' They said a verification plan for the 1976 Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty is virtually complete but some work remains on how to prevent cheating on the 1974 Threshold Test Ban Treaty. Both sides are to be allowed various methods of measuring the power of explosions, including on-site checks at each other's testing grounds Future negotiations are intended to produce more agreements to limit nuclear tests and ultimately prohibit the. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has urged <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to join in a test ban, but the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> says tests will be necessary as long as its military strategy includes reliance on nuclear weapons. Talks on nuclear testing are separate from U.S.-Soviet negotiations on reducing long-range nuclear arsenals, which resumed in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> last week. Presidential press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that a realistic verification plan is crucial to success of the new talks on monitoring tests. `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> approach to these negotiations complements our efforts to reach agreements that will strengthen our security and enhance stability,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said in a statement. `` A priority for these step-by-step talks is to complete protocols to provide for effective verification'' of the two treaties. He said the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> ratified neither treaty because `` they were not ratifiable in their original form.'' `` Our approach to these negotiations is based on a realistic approach to our security,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` As long as we must rely on nuclear weapons, we must continue to test to ensure their safety, security, reliability, effectiveness and survivability.''

<HEAD>Congressional Report: Federal Mining Agency Violated Policy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHERINE RIZZO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal agency violated its own policy when it cleared the way for an <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> coal company to strip mine coal in the <ORGANIZATION> Wayne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>, congressional investigators have concluded. `` It is improper for the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Surface </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mining </ORGANIZATION> to have based this decision on considerations other than its stated policy,'' said a report by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s mining subcommittee delivered to the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, parent of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Surface </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mining </ORGANIZATION>, on Friday and made available on Monday. Agency records showed the decision to let <ORGANIZATION> Belville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Ironton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> to mine was based on flimsy reasoning, a skimpy review and no independent documentation, according to the report. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Close </PERSON>, the director of the <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> office of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Surface </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mining </ORGANIZATION>, has said he consulted a staff attorney and believed he was on firm legal ground when he made the now-contested decision. Close in December reversed a 1986 decision and determined that the company had a valid existing right to mine in the 190,000-acre forest on the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> _ in other words, mineral rights that pre-dated creation of the forest that the federal government was bound to recognize. `` It is inappropriate for a decision of this magnitude, involving approximately 5,440 acres of <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> land, to have been based on a dearth of written independent agency analysis and supporting agency documentation,'' the report said. `` No record exists which suggests that the Office of Surface Mining conducted a thorough analysis'' before ruling that the company had a legal right to strip mine for coal, said the report. The company has submitted an application for state mining permits covering 180 acres. Spokesman <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> <PERSON> Ambs </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> `` will probably act on it sometime before the end of the summer.'' <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said Monday a deputy assistant secretary was reviewing the <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION> determination `` to see what prompted the decision, how it was based,'' and he could not comment on the report. The congressional probe was conducted at the request of Rep. <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahall </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, chairman of the He has asked <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary Manual <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> to freeze activity on all pending coal rights claims until there's a federal standard in place. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said a reply probably would be ready next week. The <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, part of the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, and the congressional investigators contend the Office of Surface Mining should have followed state standards since there's no federal standard governing companies that buy previous owners' mineral rights and apply to mine on land like national forests. An unsigned, undated Office of Surface Mining memorandum provided to the investigators said turning down the coal company was `` probably the most defensible position legally.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and its pilots' union met under court order Monday, negotiating for the first time since <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> sought permission last week to cancel the pilots' contract and impose wage and other concessions. Representatives of Eastern and the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> met with <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON>, the court-appointed examiner overseeing the airline on behalf of the bankruptcy court. A pilots' union spokesman said `` nothing fruitful'' came from the talks, which were ordered by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON>. `` It was essentially feeling-out process, a discussion of basic issues,'' said the spokesman, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Asbhy </PERSON>. Another session was scheduled for Tuesday. In a related matter, a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee plans this week to examine the impact of the nearly 4-month-old strike, and a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel has asked the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> to assess the impact <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s proposed reorganization would have on the airline industry. A group of six senators also is asking <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> to, at least temporarily, block Eastern from selling more assets, a major part of the airline's reorganization plan. A consultant to the pilots' union said over the weekend that <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> would oppose <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s bid to terminate the contract. <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> did not return calls seeking comment Monday and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> said it was n't aware of <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON>'s position. Most of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s pilots are, in effect, striking, although technically they are honoring the pickets of the striking machinists, as are <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s flight attendants. The meeting, at <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON>'s law office here, came five days after <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> requested about $ 50 million in wage and benefit concessions, as well as changes in work policies that would allow <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> to increase pilots' hours. `` We've been trying to get the pilots to meet with us for some time,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashlock </PERSON>. `` We at least see this as having brought that about.'' <PERSON> Ashlock </PERSON> declined to say whether <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> had revised any of its positions. <PERSON> Ashby </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s statements that the pilots have refused to meet were groundless and appeared to be part of an effort to convince the bankruptcy court that the pilots were acting in bad faith. The federal Railway Labor Act, which also covers airline collective bargaining, requires both sides to continue negotiating unless an impasse is declared and the talks referred to a federal mediator. `` You'd never know it by what the company says but we've met with them at every scheduled meeting,'' <PERSON> Ashby </PERSON> said. Eastern said it needed contract concessions from the pilots as part of its plan to reorganize and emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protections as a smaller carrier. <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> would have to approve the reorganization plan, which includes major asset sales. The unions unsuccessfully have sought the sale of Eastern. <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> said three weeks ago that the court would no longer consider the buyout offer of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> commodities trader <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritchie </PERSON>, although he said <PERSON> Ritchie </PERSON> was free to pursue his offer with Eastern. The airline has said it does n't plan to sell, but the unions have maintained that <PERSON> Ritchie </PERSON>'s effort to buy <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> continues. On <PERSON> Captol </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> has requested the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> investigation, saying in a letter that its review `` should examine whether the proposed business plan of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> has any realistic prospect of revitalizing the carrier.'' In a separate letter to <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>, six senators called on the transportation secretary to `` seek a delay in additional sales that could further erode the competitive base in the airline industry.'' The senators specifically cited <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s reported plans to sell its South American routes. The senators who wrote to <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> were Democrats <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Wendell </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and Republican <PERSON> Alfonse </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Attorneys for death-row convicts blasted a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling Monday that allows the execution of murderers who committed their crimes as young as 16, while prosecutors applauded the decision. `` In my opinion, it's utterly barbaric to execute any 16 - or 17-year-old,'' said <LOCATION> Sapulpa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, attorney <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Ravitz </PERSON> His client, <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Sellers </PERSON>, was convicted in 1986 of killing his parents and a convenience store clerk in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> at age 16. <PERSON> Ravitz </PERSON> argued that his client was under Satan's influence. Asked about the decision, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Nance </PERSON> said, `` I think we're pleased from the attorney general on down.'' In 5-4 votes, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said the Constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment does not prohibit execution of older juveniles or adults with only the reasoning capacity of children. In a second instance, however, the court ruled that convicted murderers have a right to demand that sentencing juries and judges consider mental retardation as a possible mitigating factor. The juvenile killers ruling affects about 25 of the 2,200 death row inmates across the nation. There are at least 11 states with one or more inmates under a death penalty for crimes committed before they were 18, according to state officials. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> topped the list with nine inmates, followed by <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> with four each. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> apparently drew the line for capital punishment at age 16 last year when they voted 5-3 to throw out the death sentence of an <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> murderer who committed the crime when 15. The ruling will probably not affect <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> because she was 15 when she stabbed a retired <PERSON> Gary </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, Bible teacher to death, said her attorney <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Touchette </PERSON>. Miss <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>'s case has drawn international attention and a call for clemency from Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> II. In <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, lawyer <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenberg </PERSON> reacted with sadness to the court's ruling. <PERSON> Eisenberg </PERSON> was the trial attorney for <PERSON> Cleo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lecroy </PERSON>, who was convicted in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> in the 1981 shooting deaths of a couple camping in rural <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lecroy </PERSON> was 17 at the time of the crime. `` Even countries such as <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> have recognized that killing their children is not something that people ought to do, and I'm sorry that in this country we do n't feel the same way, do n't have the respect for our kids' lives,'' <PERSON> Eisenberg </PERSON> said <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Snurkowski </PERSON>, who is in charge of death appeals for <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Butterworth </PERSON>, said the ruling seemed `` to affirm the system that we currently employ.'' In its decision, the high court upheld the death sentence of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> inmate <PERSON> Heath </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkins </PERSON>, who was 16 when he stabbed a <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> area liquor store clerk to death in 1985. <PERSON> Michele </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Missouri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Death </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penalty </ORGANIZATION> called the ruling `` devastating.'' `` It just gives our state rein to execute children. I can just hear prosecutors using -LRB- the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s -RRB- ruling in their closing arguments,'' Ms. <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> said. Missouri Attorney General <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> called such arguments `` hogwash.'' `` There's a lot of people that say it's going to open the door. That's ludicrous,'' said <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>. <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> said that before a juvenile can face the death penalty, he or she has to be certified as an adult, go through a battery of mental exams and have their age considered as a mitigating circumstance by the judge. But <PERSON> Wilkins </PERSON>' court-appointed attorney, public defender <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> McKerrow </PERSON>, said courts decide whether to try a youngster as an adult according to the seriousness of the crime, not the youngster's mental nature `` Where are the safeguards?'' <PERSON> McKerrow </PERSON> said. `` They make no determination of a child's maturity. They're looking at the seriousness of the crime. Then age becomes irrelevant. The fact that -LRB- <PERSON> Wilkins </PERSON> -RRB- was 16 years old made no difference.''

<TEXT>
 Actress <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Givens </PERSON> says she still loves ex-husband <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>, and the thrill of `` danger'' continues to draw her to the heavyweight boxing champion. `` I loved the danger. ... He was exciting,'' said <PERSON> Givens </PERSON>, who plays <PERSON> Darlene </PERSON> on the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> show Head of the Class. `` And I think that what people do n't realize with a certain type of woman is that there are times when she wants the man she is with to be ... a man,'' she said in an interview published in the July 1 issue of TV Guide magazine. But she said the qualities that attracted her to <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> went out of control after they married. There were times, she said, when he threaten to kill her, on one occasion even placing a pillow over her head, and there were times when he hit her. `` <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> told me that he was going to kill me and that the world would be grateful because he's made them think that I'm bad,'' she said. <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Weitzman </PERSON>, said that when he told <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> of the comments, the boxer shrugged and said, `` Come on, man.'' A new biography of <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>, `` Fire and Fear: The Inside Story of <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>,'' describes him as wife-beater who reportedly said that he never hit an opponent as hard as he hit <PERSON> Givens </PERSON> on one occasion. The two were married Feb. 7, 1988, and <PERSON> Givens </PERSON> filed for divorce in October. The divorce was finalized last month. <PERSON> Givens </PERSON> denied that her mother, <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Roper </PERSON>, helped manipulate the boxer's life during the short-lived marriage. `` People always say, ` Well, why was your mother around?' I had to beg this woman -LRB- to be around -RRB-. I could n't do it by myself,'' she said. Also false, she said, is the rumor that she moved to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> shortly before filing divorce papers to take advantage of that state's community-property laws. `` The funny thing is, not only did n't I get a fortune. I did n't get anything,'' she said <PERSON> Weitzman </PERSON> said, `` That is just false. She came away from the marriage with seven-figures-plus.'' He said she also kept numerous gifts <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> had given her during the marriage. <PERSON> Givens </PERSON> said, `` Somebody was going to have to bend, and neither of us could. What people do n't understand, what they have forgotten in all this, is: I love <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>.''

<HEAD>Mayor Returns Home Despite Alleged Threat by City Airport Commissioner</HEAD>

 Mayor <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schoemehl </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and his family returned home under increased police protection after fleeing their house for 48 hours because of threats allegedly made by the city's airport commissioner The commissioner, <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> Boykins </PERSON>, faces two misdemeanor counts of third-degree assault against <PERSON> Schoemehl </PERSON>. <PERSON> Boykins </PERSON> allegedly made the threats because of ordinances adopted last week that sharply curtailed the duties of his ex-wife, city License Collector <PERSON> Billie </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boykins </PERSON>. The mayor kept up his schedule over the weekend despite the problems, going to meetings, a high school reunion and a Jefferson Day rally, aides said. The <PERSON> Schoemehl </PERSON> family returned home Sunday night. `` He felt threatened,'' Deputy Police Chief <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauer </PERSON> said. `` We were concerned with the mayor's fears. I had no assurance from -LRB- Luther -RRB- <PERSON> Boykins </PERSON> that this was over.'' <PERSON> Schoemehl </PERSON> said police made the decision Friday to increase the number of his bodyguards from one to four. He also decided to move his family to a safe place, as he has done in the past during protests and demonstrations in front of his house. Meanwhile, the transfer of most of <PERSON> Billie </PERSON> <PERSON> Boykins </PERSON>' duties to other municipal agencies began. <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> Boykins </PERSON>, whom <PERSON> Schoemehl </PERSON> appointed airport commissioner, coordinated the mayor's 1985 re-election campaign on the city's predominantly black north side <PERSON> Schoemehl </PERSON> said <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> Boykins </PERSON>' threat was expressed to aides <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Sortino </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> `` in a very hostile, very vulgar, very aggressive way'' after <PERSON> Schoemehl </PERSON> signed ordinances stripping Ms. <PERSON> Boykins </PERSON> of most of her duties. The city aldermen drafted the ordinances on the basis of State Auditor <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>'s report that Ms. <PERSON> Boykins </PERSON> had failed to collect millions of dollars in revenues due the city. On Friday, the aldermen voted 16-13 to reduce Ms. <PERSON> Boykins </PERSON>' staff from 54 employees to three. Supporters of Ms. <PERSON> Boykins </PERSON>, who is black, contended that the ordinances were racially motivated. <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> Boykins </PERSON>, who was released from a police holdover cell shortly before midnight on Friday, could not be reached for comment on Monday. He said over the weekend he had `` no quarrel'' with <PERSON> Schoemehl </PERSON>. <PERSON> Boykins </PERSON> has a July 6 court date scheduled to answer the misdemeanor charges. Also Monday, the <ORGANIZATION> Missouri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> refused to grant Ms. <PERSON> Boykins </PERSON> an injunction that would bar the takeover of her office. Her appeal followed a circuit judge's rejection of the same request. Ms. <PERSON> Boykins </PERSON> also faces a felony-drug charge in <LOCATION> Bloomington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, that stems from her arrest near there last fall.

 Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, looking beyond the current wave of arrests and executions, said Monday night the leaders of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> can not block forever the country's `` rendezvous with freedom.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> told 1000 guests at a black-tie dinner of the <ORGANIZATION> Asia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, `` we will be there to help when the day follows the night.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s theme, in a 25-minute speech to the group, was that a `` new order'' of freedom is emerging in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. He called repression in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> `` rites of passage'' and spoke philosophically of recent events in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. `` We and some other nations have suspended business as usual,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. `` But we and the rest of the world must not let our revulsion at this repression blind us to pressure for reform.'' He added: `` <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has suffered a tragic setback, but the story is not over.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Asia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> is a private organization dedicated to improving Americans' understanding of <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> affairs. Meanwhile Monday, Chinese authorities told 11 Americans not to leave <LOCATION> Kunming </LOCATION> while charges of distributing religious tracts were investigated. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said `` we expect the matter to be resolved soon.'' The Americans went to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> June 13 despite a warning by the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> after soldiers fired on students June 3-4 in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. The Americans being held were believed to be associated with an evangelical Christian group, the <ORGANIZATION> Latter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Litchfield </ORGANIZATION>, Ill. The charges against them were not considered serious under Chinese law. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomat was on his way from the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> consulate in <LOCATION> Chengdu </LOCATION> to investigate. In the past, Americans who distributed religious tracts have been fined and asked to leave. According to <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Shub </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, the 11 Americans, who had planned to return home early next month, were detained at the <ORGANIZATION> Yunnan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> guest house and charged with passing out religious material to the public. Their passports were taken and they were forbidden to leave the city. <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Templeton </PERSON>, secretary of <ORGANIZATION> Latter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Litchfield </LOCATION>, said the group was `` 99 percent sure'' the members were in no serious trouble in <LOCATION> Kunming </LOCATION>. `` They were n't scheduled to leave for <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> until next Tuesday, and I am sure they will be leaving on schedule,'' she said. At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> intended to `` continue trying to convince the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> leadership that it is in their interest to keep reform moving forward,'' despite the recent bloodshed, said presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made the observation during an Oval Office meeting with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s new foreign minister, <PERSON> Hiroshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitsuzuka </PERSON>. `` The foreign minister said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> was encouraged by the president's experience in the region and hoped our two countries would keep each other informed on our views,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said in a statement. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was head of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> liaison office in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in 1974-75. <PERSON> Mitsuzuka </PERSON>, speaking before <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> at the society dinner, called <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s `` path toward isolation in the international community'' regrettable and appealed to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s new leaders to `` govern in a spirit of reconcilation and restraint.'' Earlier, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> was asked at a White House briefing if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had sent any communication to the new <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief, <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Zemin </PERSON>, who replaced the ousted <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON>. `` I do n't believe he has communicated with the new <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` I do n't know whether he knows him or not.'' <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>' Prime Minister <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> insisted that he, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the leaders of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> must walk `` a very difficult dividing line'' in supporting continued economic reform in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> while denouncing the crackdown on political freedom. <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON>, who met with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at the presidential retreat in Camp David, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, told reporters at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, `` We have to express a position without equivocation of condemnation ... at the same time make clear -LRB- we -RRB- want to do what can be done to assist the processes of economic reform. The interst of the people of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, and particularly those who are committed to political reform, would be very adversely affected if by the action of the rest of the world <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> was forced to turn completely in upon itself because the process of economic reform would be diminished and subsequently the opportunity to political reform.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> leaves July 3 on a trip to <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. His speech Monday night was his first summarizing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration policy on the region. `` The post-war era is over,'' he said. `` In <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, as in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, a new order is taking shape.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> will stop in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> to help plan multinational economic aid for the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. Then, in <LOCATION> Brunei </LOCATION>, he will attend the annual meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. This is an economic grouping of <LOCATION> Brunei </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>. `` The purpose of my trip is to establish the framework for a new <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> partnership,'' he told the private group. `` To build that new partnership we need continued <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> engagement in the region's politics, commerce and security.'' Above all, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> stressed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ties to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. He called for `` a more creative sharing of global responsibilities,'' and praised the Japanese for shouldering more of the cost of keeping <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops in the country _ about 40 percent. And, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> soon will be the largest donor in the world of overseas development assistance. Yet <PERSON> Mitsuzuka </PERSON>, stressed the need for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> `` to maintain a strong political, economic and military presence and commitment to the region.'' Turning to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> concluded the country clearly had decided to abandon its isolation from regional progress but the pace of political change did not match the aspirations of the people. Defending <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy against calls for sterner measures in response to the violence, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said `` we have acted in a measured way.'' He said it would be a mistake to dismantle the relationship the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> built up over two decades with the Communist government in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. However, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said, Americans and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government will stand for democratic values. And, he said, `` <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s rendezvous with freedom, like its rendezvous with the advancing nations of the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. can not be long delayed.''

<HEAD>Peruvian Army Patrol Kills 42 Guerrillas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AYACUCHO, PERU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An army patrol battled leftist rebels at their remote highland stronghold and killed 42 of them in some of the worst fighting in the rebels' nine-year insurgency, a military official said Monday. The military refused to provide information on army casualties. The troops and Shining Path rebels fought Sunday evening near the village of <LOCATION> Pampaccori </LOCATION>, 40 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Ayacucho </LOCATION>, a military spokesman said on condition of anonymity. The military spokesman said troops also captured a large number of weapons and `` subversive propaganda.'' He said it was one of the biggest losses of life suffered by the <ORGANIZATION> Shining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Path </ORGANIZATION> in their nine-year-old fight against the government. The <LOCATION> Ayacucho </LOCATION> region, 235 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, is the birthplace of the Shining Path insurgency and remains its stronghold. The guerrilla organization began its fight against the government in May 1980 after 10 years of grass roots organizing among Indian peasants in this impoverished region. Since then the violence has spread throughout the country, and more than 15,000 people have died in clashes between troops and guerrillas, as well as in rebel attacks. There has been a recent surge in rebel activity, and analysts say the stepped-up attacks are intended to sabotage municipal elections in November. In violence Monday, two policemen were killed and four were missing after 50 Shining Path guerrillas Monday ambushed a truck carrying six policemen in a mining province in the highlands, police said. The guerrillas hurled sticks of dynamite and opened fire with machine guns during the ambush, which occurred close to a copper-mining complex near <LOCATION> Huancayo </LOCATION>, 140 miles east of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, police said. Last week Shining Path rebels ambushed an army convoy in the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> jungle near <LOCATION> Aguaytia </LOCATION>, 270 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, and 20 rebels and 15 soldiers were killed in the fighting.

 Demonstrators shot while resisting the army's drive to crush seven weeks of pro-democracy protests `` got what they deserved,'' a senior military officer said Monday In another development, an explosion aboard a train late Monday killed 20 people and seriously injured 11 in the suburbs of <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, an offical of the <ORGANIZATION> Shanghai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> reported. The official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said an on-the-spot investigation showed the explosion was caused by dynamite. The <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> official on Tuesday called it an accident and said it happened at 11.13 p.m. Monday in <LOCATION> Songjiang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> county </LOCATION>, 18 -LCB- miles southwest of <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>. He said the train was bound from <LOCATION> Hangzhou </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> and that the explosion occurred in a seated compartment less than an hour before it was scheduled to reach its destination, but that he had no further details. He said an undetermined unknown number of passengers also were slightly injured. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said the explosion occurred in a toilet. On the political scene on Monday, the official press said the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> was prepared to expel members who participated in the student-led movement for a freer <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, suggesting a full-scale purge following Saturday's announcement that moderate party chief <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON> had been ousted from his party posts. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said two Americans _ a teacher and a student at <ORGANIZATION> Nankai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in nearby <LOCATION> Tianjin </LOCATION> _ were ordered to leave <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> by Friday. Teacher <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Radicia </PERSON> and student <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Qubain </PERSON> were being expelled because `` evidently they were very involved in the student movement,'' he said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The two, whose ages and hometowns were not available, were questioned by security forces, he said. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said Monday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that a group of 11 Americans who went to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> against <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> travel advice were charged by police in <LOCATION> Kunming </LOCATION> with distributing religious literature and ordered to remain in the city. The Americans' names and hometowns were not disclosed. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomat was bound for <LOCATION> Kunming </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Chengdu </LOCATION> to look into the situation. He said the charge evidently was not a serious offense. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhiyun </PERSON>, one of the commanders of the June 3-4 military assault on <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, said he had `` no regrets'' about what <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> and foreign witnesses have said was a massacre of unarmed residents and students. <PERSON> Li </PERSON>, speaking to foreign reporters invited to tour <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, stressed the government line that no shots were fired at students during the assault to remove thousands of student activists from the square. `` The whole process was non-violent. No one used guns,'' he said. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said troops shot into the air once, when `` thugs'' occupying a building to the southeast of the square opened fire, wounding one soldier. He acknowledged some innocent people `` may have been wounded'' when troops fought to reach the square, but said people were warned not to go out that night. `` When our troops moved to the square we received persistent resistance,'' <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said. `` Individuals even used guns to kill our warriors. We were forced to defend ourselves. This group of people got what they deserved.'' The government puts the death toll from the assault at about 300 and says most were soldiers who were attacked by mobs. Chinese witnesses and Western intelligence reports say up to 3,000 people were shot to death or crushed by tanks as the military stormed the city. During a tour of the square, he said black burn patches on the pavement were caused by students who set fire to tents to stop the troop advance. He called stories that troops had burned the bodies of students were `` totally untrue.'' The monument was decorated with banners reading `` carry on the will of the revolutionary martyrs'' _ a reference to soldiers killed during the attack _ and `` promote the glorious traditions of the troops.'' Bushes and grass around the monument had been replanted, and newly planted flowers bloomed in boxes between the monument and the mausoleum where <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON>'s body lies in state. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said the troops `` returned the square to the people'' but could not say when it would be reopened to the public. He said armed `` thugs'' were at large. About 1,800 people, including up to 500 in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, have been arrested nationwide since the crackdown in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> prompted widespread disturbances. The party <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday announced that <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>, a pioneer of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s past decade of economic reform, was stripped of all party posts for `` supporting the turmoils and splitting the party.'' <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Wen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hui </PERSON> <PERSON> Bao </PERSON> daily newspaper said 14 members of the `` Wild Geese Suicide Squad,'' one of many groups of young workers who joined street protests, were sentenced to up to 13 years for slashing car tires, beating drivers and blocking traffic. The report was seen in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> on Monday.

 Do n't expect to read about <LOCATION> Fairport </LOCATION> Convention in `` The <ORGANIZATION> Rolling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illustrated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> History </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Roll'' _ they're not even mentioned And do n't look for <LOCATION> Fairport </LOCATION> Convention in `` The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits'' _ they never had a hit single. While reunions of The Rolling Stones and The Who make headlines, <LOCATION> Fairport </LOCATION> Convention quietly tours the country by trailer, appearing in small clubs. But since four -LRB- soon to be six -RRB- young English musicians formed the band in 1967, <LOCATION> Fairport </LOCATION> Convention has produced some of the finest folk-rock of the past two decades. `` If you're asking whether I thought the band would still be traveling about in the late 1980s, the answer would be no,'' said guitarist <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicol </PERSON>, an original member who helped put <LOCATION> Fairport </LOCATION> Convention back together in 1985. Their early records were heavily influenced by the Beatles and the <ORGANIZATION> Byrds </ORGANIZATION>, with spirited harmonies and a tight rhythm section. Besides <PERSON> Nicol </PERSON>, the group featured the brilliant guitar playing and songwriting of <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, and the songwriting and soulful vocals of <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Denny </PERSON>. `` You had a band at the end of every street, and for most people it was a phase they went through,'' <PERSON> Nicol </PERSON> recalled. `` The unlucky ones got caught on the treadmill. We wanted to get off the treadmill.'' By their fourth album, 1969's `` <LOCATION> Liege </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Lief </PERSON>,'' <LOCATION> Fairport </LOCATION> Convention was recording traditional English songs and making greater use of the mandolin and fiddle, instruments that had been rarely used in a rock' n' roll format. They built a small, but devoted following with the originals `` Come All Ye'' and `` Meet on the Ledge,'' the traditional `` Matty Groves'' and covers of <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON>'s `` I'll Keep It With Mine'' and `` Percy's Song.'' `` I think that the Byrds had taken their roots and made it viable encouraged us,'' <PERSON> Nicol </PERSON> said of the American folk-rock group. The group went through several personnel changes and by the early'70s, <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Denny </PERSON> had left to pursue solo careers. The band struggled without them, eventually calling it quits in 1979. But in August 1980, <LOCATION> Fairport </LOCATION> Convention _ minus <PERSON> Denny </PERSON>, who died in 1978 _ reunited for a concert in <LOCATION> Cropredy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. Encouraged by the response, the band played again the following summer and now headlines an annual two-day festival of folk-rock and traditional music. They began recording again in 1985, with <PERSON> Nicol </PERSON> and two other <LOCATION> Fairport </LOCATION> Convention veterans _ bassist <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Pegg </PERSON> and drummer <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Mattacks </PERSON> _ forming the core of the group. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> was well established as a solo star so guitarist <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Allcock </PERSON> and fiddler <PERSON> Ric </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON> were recruited. `` The three of us had gotten on terribly well,'' <PERSON> Nicol </PERSON> said. `` We'd known <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> for years, he was very enthusiastic and really wanted to play with us. <PERSON> Ric </PERSON> was also a fan. We rehearsed three days and found out it was going to work.'' They have since released four albums: `` <PERSON> Gladys </PERSON>' Leap,'' `` Expletive Delighted,'' `` In Real Time'' and, most recently, `` Red and Gold.'' <LOCATION> Fairport </LOCATION> Convention has also toured extensively, using mostly new material as well as `` Matty Groves'' and `` Meet on the Ledge.'' `` It's impossible to say what a typical <LOCATION> Fairport </LOCATION> audience is because they all look different,'' <PERSON> Pegg </PERSON> said. `` We get 17 - and 18-year-old kids who have discovered the music for the first time and people in their 50s A lot of our audience are more familiar with the new stuff.'' The title track from `` Red and Gold'' was written by <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> McTell </PERSON>, a friend of the band who learned that <PERSON> Cropredy </PERSON> had been the site in 1644 of a bloody battle during the English civil war. The album also includes a cover of `` Open the Door Richard''; a pair of instrumentals written by <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>, `` The Rose Hip'' and `` The Battle''; and a traditional ballad, `` The Beggar's Song.'' `` It's just surprising when you come up with traditional songs that people have n't heard before,'' <PERSON> Pegg </PERSON> said. `` The best ones have been recorded, if not by us, then by other bands like <PERSON> Steeleye </PERSON> <PERSON> Span </PERSON>. They got about 50 percent of the really good songs and we got the rest.''

 Want to know what smoked rattlesnake tastes like? How to lower your cholesterol level? How to patch wallpaper? <PERSON> Robb </PERSON> <PERSON> Weller </PERSON> is your man. <PERSON> Weller </PERSON> is co-host of <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Home,'' a daytime forum for ideas, suggestions and hints that can be applied to viewers' lives. `` I'm probably a lot healthier than I was because ` Home' has changed my eating habits,'' said <PERSON> Weller </PERSON>. `` The only problem with being the host of a show like this is you turn into a pain in the neck to your friends. Instead of talking in sentences, you talk in household hints. You go to a friend's house and tell him how to make a quick fix on torn wallpaper with toothpaste or fill a nail hole with paint mixed with a little cornstarch. `` On the show, I might talk about the benefits of rock garlic. I've eaten everything they bring on the show to make people healthy, from raw nasturtiums to smoked rattlesnake. It tastes like smoked chicken. In fact, everything tastes like smoked chicken except smoked chicken, which tastes like fajita.'' <PERSON> Weller </PERSON> is quick to add, however, that you should n't get the idea that `` Home'' is all household hints. `` It's so versatile that it's difficult to talk about,'' he said. `` It's not like ` Oprah' or ` <PERSON> Donahue </PERSON>,' with one host and one topic each day. There are seven aspects of ` Home' each day. It can be hints, cooking, medicine, emotional help, home decoration, or a wide variety of things.'' <PERSON> Weller </PERSON>, who is also co-anchor of the syndicated `` Entertainment This Week,'' has been the host of `` Home'' since its debut last year. The show has a rotating system of co-hosts who appear with <PERSON> Weller </PERSON>. In addition, `` Home'' also has a staff of experts on such topics as home decorating, arts and crafts, food, carpentry, leisure and recreation, money-saving tips, car repair, home repair, picking movies for children and human-interest stories. `` This is a research-driven show,'' said <PERSON> Weller </PERSON>. `` Viewers contribute an enormous amount to the show. They make suggestions and tell us who they want to see on the show. We have a program that's not particularly high in the ratings but attracts a lot of women in the 18-49 age category We get 35,000 requests a week for our newsletter, which costs $ 1.'' <PERSON> Weller </PERSON> grew up in <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, and attended the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION>. He was a yell leader at athletic events and is credited with creating `` The Wave,'' the crowd ripple that has become a fixture at sporting events. He began his television career in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> and later worked in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, for Qube, a cable company that had two-way communications with its viewers. `` I was host of a live talk show in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> and whatever happened, happened,'' he said. `` Once we had a chicken-flying contest. One chicken flew right into the lighting board. Zap! So, what do you do? We had no commercials, so I threw it to the band. `` We were doing ` <ORGANIZATION> Fernwood </ORGANIZATION> 2Night' for real. It was a lot of fun. I was 27 years old and it was my first big, steady gig in television. I would n't move to <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> unless I earned my age. We fought and fought and I finally got $ 27,000 a year.'' He and <PERSON> Leeza </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON> were co-hosts of `` Two on the Town'' at <ORGANIZATION> WCBS </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> when they were both summoned to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> by `` Entertainment Tonight.'' <PERSON> Weller </PERSON> was co-anchor of `` Entertainment Tonight'' for two years, and he and <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON> are co-anchors of the weekend version. <PERSON> Weller </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>, a former entertainment editor for the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sun-Times </ORGANIZATION>, have an 11-month-old daughter, <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON>. `` We're homebodies,'' he said. `` We do n't go to gala openings or <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> parties. When we go to the movies, we go to a neighborhood theater. `` My wife's biggest problem with me is getting me out of the yard on weekends. I love to putter. I find great solace in that after a week of 12-hour days. I have to be at work on ` Home' at five in the morning.'' He and his wife are also involved in projects of their own, such as a video workout for overweight women called `` Women at Large,'' and plans for a half-hour cable show expanding on the video.

 In her small laboratory, <PERSON> Maritza </PERSON> <PERSON> Vela </PERSON> <PERSON> Garzon </PERSON> gently opens a 400-year-old book as if it were a jewel case. The red and black Gothic type reveals a breathtaking antiquity _ and a tragic carelessness: there are thumb-sized holes in the first few pages. `` Someone put Scotch tape on these pages,'' she said. `` They thought they were doing the right thing, keeping a tear from worsening.'' The glue from the tape eventually ate through the old paper. Mrs. <PERSON> Vela </PERSON> <PERSON> Garzon </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Colombian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION>'s only staff expert in book preservation and restoration, hopes to repair the damage. It's a painstaking task. And a frustrating one. Among the library's 28,000 old and rare books are entire Jesuit libraries seized in the late 1700s by the Spaniards. About 40 volumes date back to before the invention of moveable type in 1500. The oldest, printed in 1480, is by <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> of </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquinas </PERSON>. Many were printed or illustrated by hand. They beg for attention. `` It's not a question of negligence,'' the library's director, <PERSON> Ruben </PERSON> <PERSON> Sierra </PERSON>, explained in an interview. `` It's simply a lack of money.'' The same refrain can be heard across financially strapped <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, where governments struggling with big foreign debts, grinding poverty and other urgent economic and social problems have little time or money for cultural preservation. <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> said he's heard stories from state librarians of much worse situations in other countries. One national library's shelves are full of cats, he said, because it's the only affordable way they can deal with the rats. Indeed, compared with most neighboring countries <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> enjoys a thriving economy and a low inflation rate, running at about 25 percent a year. But its $ 20 billion-debt is still burdensome, and a program of relative public austerity has been in effect for years. `` They promised us some money, but it did n't come,'' <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> said. `` There's always something else that takes precedence. Last year it was emergency flood aid for the coast, this year who knows what it will be.'' <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> said he expects to receive about 30 million pesos, the equivalent of about $ 80,000 this year to run the 900,000-volume library. It is less than half what the library asked for. Nonetheless, he is hopeful the government will come up with an extra 200 million pesos -LRB- about $ 540,000 -RRB- next year for creating a respectable conservation and restoration center. Mrs. <PERSON> Vela </PERSON> <PERSON> Garzon </PERSON> works alone in her small lab, crowded with equipment, much of it donated by the Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. She has one small chest for fumigating the several hundred old books infected with mold, a few dozen at a time. `` This is the first step. There is much left to do,'' she said. `` For right now, we can only take care of the most valuable, or those that most urgently need attention.'' The library was created in the 1770s, when <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> was still a colony of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. Authorities needed a place to shelter thousands of leather-bound volumes confiscated from Jeusit colleges and missions when the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> clerical order was expelled from the Spanish kingdom. All of the rare volumes have been catalogued; not so in the rest of the library. Boxes holding some 40,000 books are piled high in the cellar, awaiting revision. No one's sure when they arrived, or exactly what they hold. According to <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION>, a predecessor solved a similar problem in 1972 by simply selling 15,000 books as scrap to a local paper company. `` It was a barbarous act,'' he said. But he added that some of the books were salvaged, including historically important records.

<TEXT>
 For the past several years, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s hulking, pug-nosed armored cars called Casspirs have run the roads and plowed the bush of <LOCATION> Ovamboland </LOCATION> in the search for guerrillas of the <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-. To the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africans </LOCATION>, who invented it, the 11-ton vehicle, with its heavy firepower and sturdy protection against landmines, it is the ultimate weapon for counter-insurgency warfare. To the local people, the Casspir is the embodiment of evil. They largely support SWAPO and they look upon the South Africans an an army of occupation. Now, with the 23-year <PERSON> bush </PERSON> war supposedly at an end and <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> preparing for independence from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> under <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> supervision, a change of image may be in store for what one bumper sticker seen here calls `` Casspir _ an unfriendly ghost.'' <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> police monitors assigned to watch the local security forces and report abuses of authority during the election campaign are preparing to acquire at least 10 Casspirs for their own use. In <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> livery _ white paint with big black `` <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION>'' letters on the side _ the armored cars will no longer instill the fear that many people say they felt whenever the army or police roared past, turrets bristling with machine guns. Although various versions of the Casspir have been employed by regular and paramilitary forces in <LOCATION> Ovamboland </LOCATION>, it's fearsome reputation stems mainly from the <ORGANIZATION> Koevoet </ORGANIZATION>, the counter-insurgency police made up of local black officers led by white South Africans. <ORGANIZATION> Koevoet </ORGANIZATION> _ the names mean `` crowbar'' in <LOCATION> Afrikaans </LOCATION> _ is notorious for tough and often brutal tactics in prying out the <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas infiltrating across the border from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. Local people tell of terrorist raids, beatings and crop destructions in <ORGANIZATION> Koevoet </ORGANIZATION>'s campaign to crush <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION>, and a few <ORGANIZATION> Koevoet </ORGANIZATION> members have been charged with murder. Some of <ORGANIZATION> Koevoet </ORGANIZATION>'s Casspirs, actually a more powerful version called the Wolf Turbo, have been earmarked for the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> police monitors operating out of <LOCATION> Oshakati </LOCATION>, the nerve center for <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> operations in the region. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON>, a silver-haired Irishman on leave from his post as a <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> police superintendent to serve as district commander of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> contingent, calls the Casspirs `` absolutely the most intimidating articles I have ever seen in my life.'' He said it was necessary, however, for the U.N. <ORGANIZATION> Transition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> to have its own Casspirs in order to keep track of the local police, who continue to use them on bush patrols of up to seven days at a time. Unlike the police, the UNTAG vehicles will have no weapons on board. Under U.N. Resolution 435, which spells out procedures for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s independence by early next year, <ORGANIZATION> Koevoet </ORGANIZATION> has already been integrated into the South-West African Police. However, the unit remains active and reports persist of <ORGANIZATION> Koevoet </ORGANIZATION> members continuing to badger residents who express pro-SWAPO sympathies. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials at the operational level say proof of police abuse is hard to obtain, and UNTAG recently moved to double to 1,000 the number of monitors assigned as police watchdogs. The sight of numerous police Casspirs in recent days with their 50-caliber machine guns still mounted also indicates that the police forces have not fully complied with a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> proviso for disarming the vehicles. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Eckhard </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said it was understood that the police would carry only small arms. While not clearly defined, he said, this was generally taken to mean nothing more than sidearms and semi-automatic rifles. Mounted machine guns would violate that understanding, he said. Many South Africans see the Casspir as the proudest achievement of a home-grown arms industry springing out of a 1972 arms import embargo, imposed by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in response to the South African government's refusal to abandon apartheid. Military sources say that despite the embargo, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> now manufactures 95 percent of its own weapons and has become the world's 10th largest arms exporter, with customers in 32 countries. Casspirs have reportedly been put on display at international arms shows. The name Casspir is an acronym derived from the vehicles' designers, the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scientific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>, and the South African Police, for whom it was originally developed Different versions are tailored for a specific task, carrying infantry into battle or urban riot control. Its most innovative feature is a heavily armored, V-shaped underbody designed to deflect, rather than absorb, the blast of a land mine. While <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> has periodically claimed to have damaged or destroyed the vehicles in the bush war, South African military sources say Casspirs that hit SWAPO-laid mines suffered only minor crew injuries and damage that was easily repaired.

<TEXT>
 Seniority is n't what it used to be. Once the coin of congressional status, it was devalued by reform. There are new status symbols, including the personal political action committee, a growing practice that is now the target o new reform proposals. By setting up a committee, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> can collect campaign funds and dole them out as contributions to other members or to candidates who, presumably, will not forget the favor. They are called `` leadership PACs,'' and there are about 50 of them. They do seem to be a mark of success. Among them are the political action committees of the three newly-installed leaders of the Democratic majority and the two top men in the Republican minority. <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Rutgers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> political scientist, says in a study published by the Twentieth Century Fund that the number of leadership PACs funneling contributions from one member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to another is likely to grow. `` PACs seem to offer members a kind of prestige,'' he says. `` To have a PAC is, for some, a mark of their sovereignty in a <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> whose 535 members act increasingly like independent entrepreneurs.'' A personal PAC also can be used to finance the political travels of the member who sets it up, enabling a senator or representative to appear at events around the country _ a vital opening phase of a presidential campaign. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> concentrates reform suggestions on the use of PACs by members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to extend their influence with other members. He dates the rise in the use of campaign donations to influence inside-the-House competition from the fall of the system under which committee chairmen were chosen strictly by seniority. That change made chairmanships subject to secret ballots in the majority party caucus. Political action committees of all varieties are big business. They also are a favorite target of reformers who see them as vehicles for special interest money and influence. Their support goes heavily to incumbents. They can give a candidate up to $ 5,000 an election; individuals are limited to $ 1,000. They are an unintended byproduct of the campaign reforms that followed the Watergate scandal. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has proposed legislation that would ban contributions by political action committees, effectively eliminating them because they have no other purpose. Labor, business and interest group PACs _ 4,268 of them _ paid out $ 148,085,016 in campaign contributions in 1988. While the leadership PACs represent only a fraction of that, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said their influence is significant, in part because of their sponsorship. So, too, he said, is their impact on the inside politics of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, on contests for committee chairmanships and on leadership elections. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> cites the in-House campaign of Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, now the Democratic whip, for his previous rung on the leadership ladder as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> caucus. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> was n't shy about using campaign contributions to his colleagues to gain support in that three-way contest. He set up his own PAC, the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opportunity </ORGANIZATION>, and sent out a request for contributions to be relayed to other House Democrats. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s study recounts <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>'s request for checks for `` $ 500 or $ 1,000 so that I can begin to build the active support within the Democratic members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to win this key leadership position.'' The Gray committee made about $ 140,000 in campaign contributions to 95 candidates during the 1988 election season, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elections </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> PAC </ORGANIZATION>, the House Leadership Fund, contributed more than $ 134,500 to 74 other Democrats. The Effective Government Committee, the <ORGANIZATION> PAC </ORGANIZATION> set up by Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mo </LOCATION>., now majority leader, spent $ 222,000, most of it on his unsuccessful campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination His PAC gave $ 24,000 to eight other candidates. While those party leaders have their own committees, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s study suggests that their leadership tasks may be made more difficult by the proliferation of leadership PACs `` The greater the number of important players armed with their own checkbooks, the harder the job of party leaders as they try to manage the delicate and often frustrating task of building parliamentary majorities,'' he says. `` The result is an increasing fragmentation of power and decreasing importance of parties, the basis of our form of democracy. `` PACs not only post a threat to the traditional structure of our government, they also contribute to the growing perception of a political system run by money _ a system that is, if not corrupt, corruptible,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> says.

 Almost every day a small group shows up on <LOCATION> Parliament </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> to protest Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>'s austerity budget, but they have yet to set off nationwide outcries against belt-tightening and higher taxes. <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>'s government drew up the austerity budget as a means of controlling <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s budget deficit, and austerity may be the tone he is setting at least for the start of his second term. <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> led his <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to a second consecutive majority government last fall in an election whose overwhelming issue was approval of the free trade agreement with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. His victory cleared the way for the pact to take effect Jan. 1 as scheduled. However, his critics charge that since the trade agreement was the key issue in the campaign the election outcome did not give <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> a mandate to tackle the budget deficit at the expense of programs that the Canadian government traditionally has supported. Although the Canadian public has remained largely silent, a Gallup poll published June 15 indicated that only 30 percent of Canadians would vote now for <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>, compared to 45 percent for the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> led by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>. It was the Progressive Conservatives' worst showing in that opinion poll since November 1987. But the prime minister has little to worry about for now. He is at least three years away from having to call another election and early in his term is an ideal time to put unpopular programs into place. Several factors appear to be working in <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>'s favor to defuse any public indignation at what once would have been unthinkable changes in government programs such as unemployment insurance. Both major opposition parties are involved in internal races of their own, because their longtime leaders have announced they are stepping down. The Liberals wo n't pick a new leader until June 1990, although <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> is staying on in the interim and spearheading his party's criticism of the budget The socialist <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which scored 21 percent in the June Gallup poll, will pick a new leader to replace veteran <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Broadbent </PERSON> at the outset of winter. <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> and his supporters also started immediately after the November election to lay the groundwork for the plans to bring the deficit under control. `` The alternative is to keep this mountain of debt growing and place it on the backs of your kids and grandchildren,'' <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> told Canadians. What brought more public furor was a leak of the budget the night before it was to be released April 27, a violation of traditional Canadian secrecy about the document until it is officially reported in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. The debate about the leak lasted weeks and, as political columnist <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Goar </PERSON> wrote in the <ORGANIZATION> Toronto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION>, it `` kept the nation's mind off one of the most painful and pivotal budgets in recent history.'' In the meantime, analysts say they have found that as little as one fifth of the savings in the budget intended for deficit control come from spending restraints. The rest comes from increasing taxes. A survey by the private <ORGANIZATION> Global </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION> consulting firm found that tax increases amounted to nearly 7.2 billion Canadian dollars -LRB- $ 6 billion -RRB- of the 9 million dollars -LRB- $ 7.5 billion -RRB- that could be considered deficit control measures. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Axworthy </PERSON>, one of the most prominent Liberal members in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, said much of the impact of the prime minister's budget has been camouflaged. `` There's going to be a delayed reaction,'' he maintained in an interview. `` I do n't think they're out of the woods on the budget at all; it's like a perpetual toothache.'' Despite the raised taxes and cut expenses, a deficit for 1989-90 remains of 30.5 billion Canadian dollars -LRB- $ 25.3 billion -RRB-. That has prompted <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>'s supporters in the business community to charge that he has not moved strongly enough to bring the deficit under control. The ratio of debt to gross domestic product is about 5 percent, double that of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and second only to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> among the leading industrial nations.

 Abortion is a secret act in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Federal law makes it a crime, except in cases of rape or if the woman's life is endangered. The Roman Catholic church calls all abortions a sin. Yet Mexican health officials estimate that one in 10 pregnancies end that way every year. The estimate may be low. The last time an attempt was made to change the law, in 1979, pro-abortion lawmakers were beaten in the streets. Their photographs appeared on posters calling them `` assassins.'' Marchers denounced them as `` communists.'' But pro-abortion activists are ready to make another try, and anti-abortion activists are girding for battle. `` There is pressure by a lot of leftist groups to legalize abortion,'' said <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Serrano </PERSON> <PERSON> Limon </PERSON>, leader of the Pro-Life organization. `` But we are ready to fight this dangerous movement.'' The pro-choice side has been encouraged by news and other accounts of the arrest, interrogation and alleged mistreatment of eight women after they had abortions. They are also watching closely the abortion debate in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The arrests took place March 16, when <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> and nine other women were returning to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> from an illegal abortion clinic in the adjacent state of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Three police intelligence agents stopped their van at gunpoint. `` Bitches!'' <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> said they shouted at them. `` Whores! Assassins!'' They were taken to an intelligence police jail where they were later joined by a doctor, two nurses and a receptionist who were arrested at the clinic. <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON>, 27, a schoolteacher's wife and mother of a 3-year-old daughter, said she and the others were slapped and pistol-whipped. She added that they could hear the screams of their elderly doctor being tortured with electric shocks. Then, she said, they were interrogated about their abortions. The women also were subjected to what <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> called `` painful and humiliating'' pelvic examinations in the presence of three men who made sexually disparaging remarks. `` I felt like I was going to faint because of the abortion, the emotional stress and the fact I had not eaten since the day before,'' <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> recalled in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. After 14 hours, the women were released without being charged. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> police spokesman <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Algorri </PERSON> confirmed that uniformed intelligence agents arrested the women. In an interview, <PERSON> Algorri </PERSON> handed over a copy of the arrest report, saying, `` That's all the information I have. The report did not say what happened after the arrests. <PERSON> Algorri </PERSON> would not comment on <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON>'s charges that the women were mistreated. <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> said she went public with her account at the urging of fellow members of the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and because `` my life is threatened anyway.'' Pro-choice activists are hoping to rewrite the 1931 law that outlaws abortion except in the cases of rape or endangerment of the woman's life. `` I have been involved in the women's rights movement here in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> for 15 years and I've only seen two cases where judges approved the abortions,'' said <PERSON> Heather </PERSON> <PERSON> Dashner </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> activist. The penalty for women who have illegal abortions is an automatic suspended sentence, but doctors who perform them can lose their medical licenses. Federal deputy <PERSON> Amalia </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Mexican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> plans to propose clarifying guidelines for legal abortions when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> reconvenes in the fall. If there is enough public support, <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> will propose legalizing all voluntary abortions. The last such proposal, made in 1979, created an uproar before dying in committee. `` I think <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> has changed,'' <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> said. `` There is more tolerance. A more open way of thinking.'' Still, she said, a fight to legalize abortion would be tough. Both the Catholic church and the vocal Pro-Life group, which oppose all abortions, are powerful in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Pro-Life leader <PERSON> Serrano </PERSON> said he is ready for battle. During an interview AP in his office, <PERSON> Serrano </PERSON> pointed to 7-foot-high stacks of anti-abortion petitions the group will begin circulating this summer. By September, Pro-Life plans to present <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> with the signatures of at least 5 million people opposing abortion, he said. Some pro-choice activists believe <PERSON> Pro-Life </PERSON>'s vocal anti-abortion campaign fostered the climate that led to the arrests of <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> and the others. <PERSON> Rosario </PERSON> <PERSON> Villalobos </PERSON>, who accompanied <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> during her abortion and who also was arrested, said that the week before <PERSON> Serrano </PERSON> had called for a crackdown on abortion clinics. `` I do n't think it was a coincidence,'' <PERSON> Villalobos </PERSON> said, but <PERSON> Serrano </PERSON> denied any responsiblity for the arrests. `` The newspapers said we were starting another Inquisition,'' <PERSON> Serrano </PERSON> said. `` Although abortion is a crime, we condemn the torture, the physical aggression against the women.'' A crackdown on clinics wo n't stop women from ending pregnancies, federal deputy <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> said. Most women in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, where an unskilled female worker makes about $ 3.50 a day, can not afford the $ 125 to $ 400 that clinics charge. Instead, they perform their own abortions or seek help from a midwife, nurse or friend. Mexican women fling themselves down stairs, use coat hangers, drink risky herbal brews or douche with cleaning chemicals. They sometimes bleed to death afterward, <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> said. While the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> estimates the abortion rate at 10 percent of 2.4 million pregancies annually, a recently published government study estimated 700,000 abortions are performed nationwide annually. The estimate was drawn from a survey showing 70,000 women were treated for post-abortion complications at Social Security hospitals in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> in one year. The study, which did not survey private hospitals and clinics, indicated that women with abortion-related complications are the third most common Social Security hospital patient. It said six of every 100 such patients die. Although birth control was legalized in 1972, unwanted pregnancy is common. Many women do n't use birth control because of ignorance or because they are ashamed to ask for it. Some live in rural areas where contraceptives are unavailable. Most women undergoing abortions have at least three children and can not afford another, <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> said. Or they need to work, she said. Both public and private sector employers give female job applicants pregnancy tests. Pregnant applicants are turned away; pregnant workers are fired. `` Lots of <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> women have abortions,'' <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> said. `` The only difference is that I talked about it.''

 More than 15,000 people work for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, enough to populate a medium-sized town. That's almost 10 times the number of aides and clerical workers on the payroll 50 years ago. Has the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> paper chase gotten out of hand? That's the subject of considerable debate among political scientists and others who keep an eye on the Hill.

<TEXT>
 On New Year's Day, 1934, <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Klopstad </PERSON> stepped off the train at <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s Union Station, a 22-year-old shorthand whiz on her first trip away from her hometown of <LOCATION> Spink </LOCATION>, S.D. The next day, she went to work as a secretary in Room 452 of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Building </ORGANIZATION>, one of fewer than 600 employees on the staffs of the 96 senators and their committees. How that 600 has grown. Today, about 4,000 people work for 100 senators; committees employ 1,700 more. The story in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> is similar. In 1934 there were 992 employees; in 1989, between members and committees, there are 9,683. In all, more than 15,000 people work for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> _ enough for a medium-sized town. One is <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Klopstad </PERSON> <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON>, still deep in the congressional paper chase 55 years after she took her first dictation for <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> Democrat <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bulow </PERSON>. Since 1973, she has been the administrative assistant to Rep. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moorhead </PERSON>, R-Calif. `` Now, of course, it's so different,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON> says `` You think of a rural area and now it's a metropolis. It's that different.'' It sure is. People worry about it. Political scientists write books about it. Some say the staffs have grown too big, that all they do is help their bosses get re-elected. Others disagree. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> needs more staff, they say, because it has more work to do now. As staffs have grown, so has their work space. The office <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON> unlocks each morning shortly after 8 a.m. is Room 2346 of the <ORGANIZATION> Rayburn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Office Building, one of three <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> office buildings _ and two annexes _ tourists encounter as they drive up the long slope of Independence Avenue to the south of the Capitol. On the northern, or <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, side, are three <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> office buildings. By mid-afternoon, Mrs. <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON> has papers spread all around her. Snatching some from a chair so a visitor can sit, she recalls that in 1934 she was one of four people on <PERSON> Bulow </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> staff. He kept an office in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, to be sure, but it was in his home in <LOCATION> Beresford </LOCATION>. Her current employer, <PERSON> Moorhead </PERSON>, has a staff of nine in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, plus two back home in <LOCATION> Glendale </LOCATION> and three more in <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION>. Such district staffs are typical. In 1959, roughly half the members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had full-time, year-round offices in their states or districts. Now all do, usually more than one. Sens. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, D-Tenn., have eight home offices apiece Sens. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, both <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Democrats, each has seven. Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, D-Ill., has four district offices, staffed by 57 workers Many congressional staff members, both in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and at home, work on `` constituent services'' _ dealing with complaints about their boss' stand on an issue, answering questions about legislation, helping voters penetrate the bureaucracies of the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> or the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, for example. Others assist their bosses in dealing with the welter of legislation before them. One recent day, as the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> debated the budget resolution, four senators were on the floor. Two aides flanked Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.M. </LOCATION>, thrusting papers in front of him. Across the aisle, Sen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Tenn </LOCATION>., conferred with two aides More than a dozen others sat on a red plush bench in the rear of the chamber. Or consider the role of staffs in melding divergent <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> versions of legislation into one bill both houses can accept. For example: In Room 2175 of the Rayburn Building, where <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> conferees are discussing the minimum wage bill, Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, leafs through the conference agenda `` It is my understanding,'' he says, `` that there has been agreement at the staff level and we do have recommendations on items 2, 3, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 16. It is my understanding we can just go through those or just move to adopt them if there is no further discussion.'' There is none. Items 4 to 7, on the other hand, deal with the sub-minimum training wage, a key point of dispute between congressional Democrats and the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. `` We have indicated they could n't be part of a staff recommendation and would be decided by the members,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> says. After brief discussion, the items are left in. At that point, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeffords </PERSON>, R-Vt., the only senators present, must leave for a vote on the floor Representing the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> side is left to <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 33, chief labor counsel of the committee, and a cluster of other staff members. That brief meeting on May 2 was the culmination of weeks of staff work, beginning when the bill passed the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on April 12. Democratic and <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> aides met separately to formulate their positions. Then all the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> aides got together. There were similar meetings in the House. Then there were four meetings of aides with the members of the conference committee, going through the agenda item by item, making objections, agreeing on changes. After each preliminary meeting, says one aide, the staffs carried the changes to their bosses for approval. `` The member is always involved in terms of final approval,'' he says. When the conference committee met, says the aide, who commented on the condition he not be identified, `` It was really easy. We did n't know until that moment that it was going to be easy.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON>, reflecting on what staff members do, says, `` There's a volume of work. I would n't think we needed all those people, but ...'' She lets the thought trail off. Others are more blunt. `` Basically, they will get as many staff members as they possibly can,'' says <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Liedl </PERSON>, director of the Congressional Assessment Project of the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. `` As their power grows, they are able to get into more and more mischief, and I think having the staff is just another resource that allows them to.''

 On the other hand, <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Deering </PERSON>, an associate professor of political science at <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> who specializes in the study of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, says the number of congressional staff members is `` hardly outrageous when you compare it to the size of the operation and the responsibilities that they have. It's really quite an appropriate staff level, it seems to me.'' Still, it is by far the largest staff of any legislative body in the world. The Canadian <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, which is second, has an administrative staff of 1,700 and an additional 1,500 employees who work for members. The swelling of congressional staffs _ from just over six per senator when Mrs. <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to 40 or more today _ was sharply criticized in a 1980 book by <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Malbin </PERSON>, then a research fellow at the conservative-leaning <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. In `` Unelected Representatives,'' <PERSON> Malbin </PERSON> wrote that the staggering growth in the number of aides `` has reinforced a situation in which the deliberative aspect of representation gets short shrift on all but the broad outlines. ... The process no longer forces members to talk to each other to resolve the tough issues.'' <PERSON> Deering </PERSON> says members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> range `` all the way from a member who is pretty much staff-driven to members who do n't deal with their staffs at all.'' Rep. <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dicks </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Wash </LOCATION>., has seen the process from both sides Before his election to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in 1976, he served for three years as legislative assistant and later administrative assistant to the late Sen. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Magnuson </PERSON>. In the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Dicks </PERSON> finds, there is `` more direct member involvement and interest'' than in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> because the 435 representatives are not spread as thinly among the committees as the 100 senators are. `` You hear some grousing in the cloakroom about how we have to go to conferences and the senators sometimes do n't show up and you've got to deal with the staff of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>,'' he says He adds, however, that as a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> he has been `` impressed with the level of knowledge that the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee chairmen have and you did n't feel that they were being led around by the staff. `` I think, frankly, that the American people get a good return on the investment in congressional staff,'' <PERSON> Dicks </PERSON> says. So do the members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, he adds. Staff members `` can make or break you. If they make mistakes and get you in trouble, it can hurt you. On the other hand, if they do a good job, it can do you an enormous amount of good. It's a big advantage for the incumbent.'' Indeed it is, say critics, and that's the rub. `` If they are helping <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> solve national problems, then it's good,'' says the <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>'s Liedl `` If they are focusing more on doing activities that help their individual congressmen expand and keep power, as in helping them get re-elected, then it's disturbing. <PERSON> Dicks </PERSON> is by no means alone as a member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> who graduated from being an aide to a lawmaker from his state. House Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., worked for the late Sen. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> majority leader, worked for Sen. <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON> <PERSON> Muskie </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Landon </PERSON> <PERSON> Kassebaum </PERSON>, R-Kan., worked for Sen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Pearson </PERSON> <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> aides also move on to other jobs in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. A check of 58 biographical sketches of key government officials in the Federal Staff Directory for 1988 showed that 10 of them had worked on Capitol Hill. They included an assistant attorney general, two assistant secretaries of <ORGANIZATION> state </ORGANIZATION>, the director of an independent agency and members of three full-time commissions. Like the senators and representatives they work for, the staff aides get lobbied. `` To be honest with you, most of our nuts-and-bolts work is done with the staff members,'' says <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Magill </PERSON>, legislative director of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, who sometimes makes his point with staff members over lunch. He buys. `` Probably the most visible of our work is appearing before the various committees and subcommittees where we make our testimony, but that usually is the final stage in a very long and drawn-out process of working with the staff members and drafting legislation and also working with the staff members to get the member that they work for to offer amendments.'' All in all, says <PERSON> Dicks </PERSON>, `` The professional staff up here does a great job and they do n't get paid very well.'' Some might disagree about the pay. Records of the clerk of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> show that Mrs. <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON> was paid $ 50,000 last year. <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> counsel, made $ 52,500. At 24, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bushman </PERSON>, press secretary to Rep. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON>, D-Ill., made $ 29,000 For some aides, there is a fair amount of travel at the taxpayers' expense. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s statement of disbursements for the six months that ended Sept. 30 showed, for example, that <PERSON> Daryl </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>, staff director of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, ran up $ 8,860 in expenses on a trip to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION>; that <PERSON> Joanne </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paulk </PERSON>, director of interparliamentary services in the secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s office, was paid $ 3,841 for a trip to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, and that her assistant, <PERSON> Yvonne </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>, got $ 3,611 for travel to <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Reykjavik </LOCATION>. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, in his book `` Running in Place,'' about his experiences on the staff of former <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republican leader <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, said that in 1982, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s chief foreign relations aide, <PERSON> Cran </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>, visited <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> in January; <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in April, and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> in May. Defenders of <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> staffs point to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' greater responsibilities these days, both at home and abroad. `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' role has increased dramatically because of the <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> programs ... our role in the world, what have you,'' says <PERSON> Deering </PERSON>. `` I do n't think there is any question the size of government itself and government responsibilities expanded in the 1960s.'' It was a simpler capital when <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Klopstad </PERSON> arrived that New Year's Day 1934. `` We were in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> about six months of the year and home about six months,'' she says. `` Now, everybody's here all the time.''

 From I.M. <PERSON> Pei </PERSON>'s glass pyramid at the Louvre to the woefully behind-schedule <LOCATION> Bastille </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Opera </LOCATION>, it is the best of times and the worst of times for the observance of the French Bicentennial. As the day of the big celebration on July 14 approaches, the French are less enthusiastic about their bicentennial than Americans were about theirs. `` What is there to celebrate?'' one Frenchman asks. `` It was a time of shame.''

 Restaurant <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Procope </PERSON>, where <ORGANIZATION> Voltaire </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Danton </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robespierre </PERSON> brooded over a beaker of vin rouge, has some interesting items on its `` Menu du Bicentenaire,'' celebrating the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution. For 289 francs, about $ 43, service compris -LRB- tip included -RRB-, one may choose: _ <ORGANIZATION> Le </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poussin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> en </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bastille </ORGANIZATION> _ baby chicken baked in a latticed pastry crust evoking the fortress prison that fell to the rebels on July 14, l789 _ <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tete </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Docteur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guillotin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> aux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> deux </ORGANIZATION> sauces _ calf's head memorializing <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Ignace </PERSON> <PERSON> Guillotin </PERSON>, the physician who advocated a more humane, more democratic method of executing traitors to the revolution than garroting or breaking them on the wheel He prescribed beheading, only to die on his own contraption. _ <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Charlotte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> et </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Son </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coulis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> _ a whipped-cream dessert with a collar of raspberry jelly in memory of <PERSON> Charlotte </PERSON> <PERSON> Corday </PERSON>, the convent novice from Calvados who went to the guillotine for stabbing the murderous madman <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Marat </PERSON> to death in his bathtub Alors, since <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> abolished capital punishment eight years ago, none of the four surviving guillotines is on display, although one recently sold at a <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> auction for $ 40,000. But souvenirs recall `` the national razor that shaved close,'' as <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickens </PERSON> called the invention that dispatched <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> XVI </PERSON>, <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Antoinette </PERSON>, Mesdames du <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> and <PERSON> Roland </PERSON>, the chemist <PERSON> Antoine </PERSON> <PERSON> Lavoisier </PERSON>, the astronomer <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailly </PERSON>, <PERSON> Georges </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Danton </PERSON> and <PERSON> Maximilien </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Robespierre </PERSON>, among 2,625 in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> alone. The deadly machine that at the height of the Reign of Terror was severing 60 heads a day is evoked on T-shirts, plates and ashtrays, plastic key rings, rubber face masks of the doomed king and queen, and wool shawls inspired by the sadistic harridans who knitted and gossiped at the foot of the scaffold while heads rolled. As part of `` la fete de la Revolution,'' tenor <ORGANIZATION> Placido </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Domingo </ORGANIZATION> will sing the title role of `` <PERSON> Andrea </PERSON> <PERSON> Chenier </PERSON>,'' the poet whose heart melted as <PERSON> Mademoiselle </PERSON> <PERSON> Corday </PERSON> ascended the guillotine, then lost his own head when the custodians of the Terror confused him with his anarchist brother. <PERSON> Umberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Giordano </PERSON>'s tragic opera is being staged in the gardens at <LOCATION> Versailles </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> XVI </PERSON> was busy at his hobby of shooting cats off the roof that muggy July day when the mob stormed the Bastille. They had hoped to release hundreds of political prisoners but found only four lunatics, who were transferred to the asylum at <LOCATION> Charenton </LOCATION>, two counterfeiters and a nobleman accused of incest. The rebels seized some arms and ammunition and decapitated <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Launey </PERSON>, the prison governor, parading his head about town on a pitchfork. `` Rien,'' the king wrote in his diary: Nothing of importance today. Next morning the mob began razing the eight-towered prison where <PERSON> Voltaire </PERSON> once was a guest for hinting that the regent <PERSON> Philippe </PERSON> <PERSON> d'Orleans </PERSON> committed incest with his daughter and where that young whippersnapper the <PERSON> Marquis </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Sade </PERSON> had time to pen some sexy memoirs of pleasure and pain. Twice a day at rush hour, motorists still storm <LOCATION> Place </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bastille </LOCATION>, with its monument marking the start of the revolution, creating l'embouteillage, the French word for gridlock, literally `` bottled up.'' The excavated remains of one of the prison towers is on view in the <ORGANIZATION> Bastille </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metro </ORGANIZATION> stop. Among a vast collection of bicentennial artifacts, including <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Antoinette </PERSON>'s prison cell dressing table and the only statue of <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> XVI </PERSON> to survive the revolution, the <ORGANIZATION> Carnavalet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> is exhibiting a miniature Bastille carved from one of the original blocks. Contractor <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Palloy </PERSON>, entrusted with the demolition of the prison, made a fortune selling these miniatures, but ended up with his neck in the guillotine. No such consumer protection against revolutionary schlock is available this time around. For President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, the bicentennial is the best of times and the worst of times. His pet project, the Bastille Opera, is woefully behind schedule, torn by political and artistic dissension and the subject of public ridicule. `` C'est une blague'' _ it's a joke _ derided a taxi driver who on screaming tires skirted the glass-sheathed edifice where on the bicentennial eve President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and other world figures will interrupt the cacophony of the hard hats to attend a concert with <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> inaugurating the unfinished auditorium.

 After the scandal attending the firing of Israeli conductor <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Barenboim </PERSON> by couturier <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Berge </PERSON> of the house of <PERSON> Yves </PERSON> <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Laurent </PERSON>, whom <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> chose to run the opera, and the subsequent resignation of composer <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Boulez </PERSON> as artistic director, <PERSON> Korean </PERSON> <PERSON> Myung-Whun </PERSON> <PERSON> Chung </PERSON> was chosen to conduct an orchestra that still has 44 vacant chairs, including key soloists. A current joke in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> asks, `` What is the difference between the Bastille Opera and the Titanic?'' `` The Titanic had an orchestra.'' The best of times already seem at hand for I.M. <PERSON> Pei </PERSON>'s glass pyramid in the courtyard of the <LOCATION> Louvre </LOCATION>, another project dear to the heart of the Socialist president, which at first was scoffed at by art critics and deplored by the citizens. Now thousands wait on line to descend escalators into the new museum entrance, admiring the way the diamond-shaped panes reflect the splashing fountains and ever changing clouds over the Seine against the somber stones of the Renaissance-style palace. The French take their time appraising objets d'art. Twelfth-century intellectuals deemed excessive the flying buttresses that support Notre Dame cathedral. Bridge builder <PERSON> Gustave </PERSON> <PERSON> Eiffel </PERSON>'s towering salute to the centennial of the revolution was denounced as `` useless and monstrous'' and `` arrogant ironmongery'' by the likes of <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Maupassant </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alexandre </PERSON> <PERSON> Dumas </PERSON> <PERSON> Fils </PERSON> Laser-lighted and repainted a rich chocolate brown for its l00th birthday, the 1,064-foot-high lacy iron tower astride four graceful Gothic arches is still the glory of the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> skyline and outdraws all other local tourist attractions. The revolution exported to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> by <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> and the <PERSON> Marquis </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Lafayette </PERSON> is being celebrated with many refrains from the American bicentennial: fireworks, rock concerts, street dances, a passage of tall ships from <LOCATION> Rouen </LOCATION> to <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Havre </PERSON>, a parade of 5l bands featuring 760 trombones, and a full-sized replica of the Statue of Liberty flame placed at the beginning of Avenue de <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>. On July l4, when all subways and buses are free, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soprano <PERSON> Jessye </PERSON> <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> will star in `` Homage a La Marseillaise,'' a show business extravaganza at Place de la Concorde, where the guillotine stood. <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> will sing the national anthem, written three years after the Bastille fell. The `` Marseillaise'' was composed by <PERSON> Rouget </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Lisle </PERSON>, a 32-year-old army officer who happened to be in <LOCATION> Strasbourg </LOCATION> at the time, spent most of the Terror in prison and later wrote a less-known anthem honoring the restoration of the Bourbon monarchy. He got an angry letter from his mother when thugs and ex-convicts from <LOCATION> Marseilles </LOCATION> marched on <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> singing his song to carry out the September l792 massacre of 5,000 political prisoners, many of them priests and children. A recent poll in <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Monde </PERSON> showed that most French know only a little about the major events of their revolution. Numerous magazine articles and TV commentators make the point that the citizens are less enthusiastic about the bicentennial than the Americans were about theirs in 1976. The revolution that began as a neighborhood disturbance in the <LOCATION> Faubourg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antoine </LOCATION> by the sans-culottes, artisans and shopkeepers who did not wear the fancy knee breeches of the aristocracy, led to the Declaration of Rights of Man and the Citizen and the eventual overthrow of the monarchy. But <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> with his whiff of grape shot was waiting in the wings, not an egalitarian representative government. Since the revolution, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> has been governed by five republics, interspersed with two emperors, three kings and a Fascist marshal. The goal of Liberte, <LOCATION> Egalite </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Fraternite </PERSON> is still on the agenda of most political parties. `` What is there to celebrate?'' asks <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Laplaud </PERSON> of <PERSON> Villeneuve </PERSON> <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Avignon </PERSON>. `` It was a time of shame. The revolution brought the Terror and then <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON>, who made <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> a lot of enemies.'' Laplaud, a heating contractor, was installing a new furnace in the penitentiary at <LOCATION> Marseilles </LOCATION> when <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> last executed a criminal, a pimp convicted of murder. He recalls that the sentence was `` delayed for several hours because the ancient truck delivering the guillotine from <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> broke down along the way.'' Bicentennial celebrants nostalgic for the last time they saw <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> will have difficulty finding comfort at any of the surviving vespasiennes, the street urinals named for the Roman emperor who was the first to provide public toilets. These endangered species are rapidly being replaced by chiraquiennes, mod, cylindrical pay toilets nicknamed for <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>, the conservative mayor of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> who is a proponent of pay-as-you-go economics.

<DATELINE>FLAT, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 You can count the year-round population of this town on the fingers of one hand. They are <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sherri </PERSON> <PERSON> Kepler </PERSON> and their three children. In the summertime, the four months of thaw in interior <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, the population swells to a grand total of maybe 30. These are gold miners drawn back as irresistibly as the migrating swallows. They come to work their old mining claims, to see anew the bedazzling flashes of yellow among the gravel in their gold pans. The lure must be irresistible because even in summer Flat has none of the amenities you might expect in any <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> village, however small, with a certified <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> post office. Not one store. Not one cash register. Not one telephone. `` I am the federal presence here,'' says <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Kepler </PERSON>. `` I am the postmaster. Here is the post office.'' He shows, proudly, a one-room building of about 10 feet by 15 feet that he explains was once a liquor store he restored according to government specifications, complete with a Zip code and a flag. `` I fly the flag by the rules,'' he says. `` I raise it at dawn, which here in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> happens in April, and I take it down at sunset, in September.'' Correction. Flat, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, does have a store. It is padlocked, but its goods are still on the shelves, unsold. The last sale was about 1942. One of the unsold items is a brand-new dog sled. It also has a bank, likewise padlocked. Inside is a roll-top desk, its pigeonholes full, a green visor and sleeve garters in one drawer, a locked vault with who knows what in it, and a set of brass scales that weighed 1.7 million ounces of gold. Flat was one of this frontier state's boomingest gold boom towns, now frozen in time but still breathing. Its gravel streets and byways are strewn with carcasses of cars and trucks and mining debris dating from the 1930s. `` When those people all left,'' says <PERSON> Kepler </PERSON>, `` I guess it was too much trouble to take them out.'' <PERSON> Kepler </PERSON>, a mechanic, drives a'38 pickup truck he made to run like a jeweled watch from salvaged parts. It would indeed have been at least as much trouble to take all that stuff out as it was to haul it in. Flat was named for nearby <LOCATION> Flat </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>. It might as easily have been named Otter for another nearby creek. -LRB- Or <PERSON> Poorman </PERSON>, for yet another, although that would not, over all, have been accurate. -RRB- It is out in the wilderness 275 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION> as the crow flies. As the hungering miners found their way here when gold was discovered by a prospector named <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Beaton </PERSON> in 1908, the route was much longer. It required riverboats up the <LOCATION> Kuskokwim </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, then up the <LOCATION> Iditarod </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> to a landing place, then eight miles overland to the gold fields of Flat. A town of about 6,000 sprang up at the landing place, Iditarod, and the gold rush became known as the Iditarod Stampede. Nothing remains of Iditarod, only weathered skeletons of a few buildings. One of them was Tootsie's, a house of ill fame. A bathtub from the collapsed rubble of <PERSON> Tootsie </PERSON>'s now resides in the home of <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sherri </PERSON> <PERSON> Kepler </PERSON> at their home in Flat, which they built and furnished themselves. `` Is n't it something, look at those clawed feet,'' says Mrs. <PERSON> Kepler </PERSON>. `` If only it could talk.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Miscovich </PERSON> remembers Tootsie's. In fact, <PERSON> Miscovich </PERSON> has a remarkable memory for every place and every excitement in Flat since he was born here in 1918 in a cabin on <LOCATION> Otter </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>. He is the son of an ambitious immigrant who heard about the Iditarod Stampede, got in on it, worked for wages, bought a claim and sent for his wife in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> is the result. He, at 71, and his wife, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>, and any of their four grown children who can make it, return to Flat every summer, with the swallows, to take out of their now extensive land holdings whatever gold a mom-and-pop operation, as he calls it, can yield. `` In the early days we took 6,000 ounces a year,'' he says. `` We do n't even try for that now, but it's still worthwhile.'' You bet. Gold appears daily in his sluice, and two years ago he unearthed a 28-ounce nugget. At the going price of gold, that alone is worth about $ 8,000. `` Well,'' says <PERSON> Miscovich </PERSON>, `` because it's a nugget and not dust, and it fits just right in the palm of your hand, it's probably worth at auction 10 times the price of gold. Some Texan would pay that to make it into a belt buckle. `` Oh, yes, we still have it,'' he says. `` You're never broke if you have a little gold put aside.'' But <PERSON> Miscovich </PERSON> did n't make it only on gold. Working for his father as a boy he had to straddle, like a horse, a huge and heavy cannon-like hose nozzle used to bust up gold-producing earth with a high-pressure stream of water. It was hard work, and dangerous. He figured there must be a better way. So he invented one, and patented it. If you have seen a fireboat at work or a ladder truck with a mounted nozzle you have seen <PERSON> Miscovich </PERSON>'s invention, a water cannon with even higher pressure but small and safe and easy to aim. `` I designed it for miners,'' he says, `` but it was firefighters who wanted it the most.''

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Miscovich </PERSON> left school in the 11th grade, never went to college. Yet the knowledge of geology and mining he picked up on his own is so recognized that he has served for years in the winter months as a consultant to mining companies, inspecting potential digging sites around the globe. He could have made a fine living at that alone. It is n't need or greed, he says, that draws him and his wife here every summer from their comfortable winter home in <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. Their home here is typical of an <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> mining camp It is small, tin-roofed, its plumbing uncertain, its dooryard cluttered with old wagon wheels, moose antlers, remains of mining equipment. `` It does n't have all the comforts,'' he says, `` but we actually look forward to coming back every year. `` We like the isolation. We like getting out and working with our hands. If the ballgame on TV, or the Sunday paper, or the movie house are n't all that important to you you would understand.'' The now-empty town also brings back vivid memories for <PERSON> Miscovich </PERSON>. He remembers the day <ORGANIZATION> Wiley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> crash-landed here in 1933. A snapshot of <PERSON> Miscovich </PERSON> with the pioneer aviator hangs on his wall. He remembers catching fish as a boy, selling them to the miners to relieve their diet of moose steaks, and of the excitement when a bear would wander into town. He remembers the Fourth of July bashes at the recreation hall that lasted three days. The hall remains, decorated with 48-star flags and a fine upright piano. The piano needs tuning. And he remembers the great Black Bear gold robbery, Flat's only recorded crime. `` It was set up by the mail carrier who delivered the gold by dog sled, $ 120,000 worth, and by a prostitute known as Black Bear _ her sister was called The Cub _ and by her procurer. `` They got caught, the gold was recovered, the mailman turned state's evidence and went free. The other two were tried in Fairbanks. The jury set them free, too ... `` Black Bear and the procurer later made a fortune in bootlegging and went off to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> to raise racehorses.'' <PERSON> Miscovich </PERSON> saw the boom end and Flat's terminal illness set in. Flat became inaccessible except by airplane, the old Iditarod road rendered impassable by neglect. Small operators could n't meet the bottom line. For excitement in Flat today, the biggest attraction would be <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Kepler </PERSON>'s workshop. It is truly a wondrous place. Machinery from another age still functions _ lathe, drill press, saw, forge _ turned to life by a single motor and a dozen flapping belts. `` This is where I spend most of my time,'' he says. `` It's my playground.'' Anything busted, <PERSON> Kepler </PERSON> can fix. The very isolation of Flat, not to mention all that abandoned machinery to play with, was what prompted the Keplers to buy one of its forsaken houses seven years ago to use for summer outings. They lived in <LOCATION> Aniak </LOCATION>, a small village 75 miles southwest, the closest place from here where people live. He worked there as a commercial pilot and airplane mechanic. <PERSON> Kepler </PERSON> is 35. The two Kepler boys are 12 and 9 and the girl is 2. `` When the postmaster job opened up three years ago we decided to come out here and stay permanently. To us, this is paradise. I have plenty to keep me busy.'' What do you do in winter? `` Mostly cut wood.'' Wood fuels the <PERSON> Kepler </PERSON> furnace and the kitchen stove. A diesel generator provides electricity for the refrigerator, but kerosene lamps serve for much of the lighting. Do the children like the life? `` They love it. The other day <PERSON> Sherri </PERSON> and I were discussing the possibility of the post office closing down and us having to leave. The boys said they would stay without us.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Kepler </PERSON> teaches the children by correspondence, not unusual in the Alaskan outback. She uses books and lesson plans provided by the state. She talks to a correspondence teacher twice a week, by radio. `` Both boys test well above their grade level,'' she says. Every three or four months <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> cranks up his airplane and the Keplers go shopping in <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>. They have their supplies mailed back, which gives <PERSON> Kepler </PERSON> a little business at the post office. His other postal business is mainly forwarding mail in winter to the miners who keep Flat as their permanent mailing address. Unlike <PERSON> Miscovich </PERSON>, who has a regular second home, most of the others go off to various sunny places to spend their gold. The mail plane arrives three times a week, even if there's nothing to deliver Flat happens to be on the way between other more populated mail drops and it is n't much trouble to make one more landing. Besides, Alaskans have a tradition of seeing to one another out in the <PERSON> bush </PERSON>, especially during the dark, harsh winter. `` Drop us a Christmas card,'' says <PERSON> Kepler </PERSON>. `` We're always glad to hear from the outside.'' Five people there. That's all. Their address is Flat, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, 99584.

 They are disadvantaged children given an advantage their parents did n't have, a chance at the best education <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has to offer. This spring the first group of minority students to go through the Prep for Prep program collected college diplomas. The next test is how they put their knowledge and skills to work.

 The idea was planted 11 years ago by a public school teacher in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>: Find gifted minority students, give them some intensive instruction and place them in exclusive private schools. This spring that idea bore fruit. Some of the finest universities in the country _ <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oberlin </LOCATION> _ gave degrees to 10 students from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, mostly from disadvantaged neighborhoods, who entered the `` Prep for Prep'' program in 1978 as 11 - and 12-year-olds `` They go to private schools and colleges like <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION>, but they never forget where they came from,'' says <PERSON> Frankie </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON>, 22, who was in that first group of students. `` I never forgot the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> and I hope to use my newly acquired skills to give something back to that community.'' That's just how the founder, <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Simons </PERSON>, pictured it. `` What we're really interested in is leadership development,'' says <PERSON> Simons </PERSON>, 43. `` It'll be another six or eight years before they'll get out into positions in society.'' There are about 550 Prep for Prep students who will be attending the city's best private schools this fall. Another 150 from the program's early days will be in college. More than 1,700 of the most talented minority students in the city applied this year for only 150 spots. `` It's probably harder to get into Prep than to get into <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>,'' says <PERSON> Sherry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wang </PERSON>, dean of the preparatory program. Those who make it will go from graffiti-scarred, numbered schools _ P.S. 121, P.S. 183 _ to independent schools with names such as <ORGANIZATION> Fieldston </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Dalton </PERSON>, Collegiate, <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON>. They often travel from poor to affluent circumstances for the school day. And they are suddenly surrounded by white kids. `` I was leaving all my friends behind and I did n't know what private school would be like,'' says <PERSON> Lourdes </PERSON> <PERSON> Sastre </PERSON>, a 16-year-old Hispanic girl who just finished her junior year at <ORGANIZATION> Nightingale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. `` Then later, some of my friends would say, ` You're acting white.''' `` I lost a lot of friends that way,'' says <PERSON> Cherell </PERSON> <PERSON> Carr </PERSON>, a 16-year-old from <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> who is black and just finished her junior year at <LOCATION> Dalton </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION>. `` That's when I found out who my real friends are,'' says <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Sastre </PERSON>. The core of the program is a 14-month stretch of intensive instruction for public school fifth - and sixth-graders, to get them ready for the exclusive independent schools -LRB- That's preparation for preparatory schools _ Prep for Prep. -RRB- `` You ca n't imagine how hard it really can be until you get into it,'' says <PERSON> Luanda </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, an 11-year-old who will move from the sixth grade at P.S. 121 in the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Trinity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> on <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION> in the fall. `` The first summer is the toughest. You do n't know what's going on.'' Her father, <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, is a bus driver who grew up poor in <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>. He and his wife, who would read nightly to their daughter, knew Prep for Prep was the unmistakable knock of opportunity. `` When I heard there was this opportunity to go to a better school, I thought, ` This could be a better chance in life,''' <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> says. `` It's very hard, but there's a challenge in everything. Nothing good is easy.'' Children accepted into Prep for Prep find themselves immersed in a rigorous summer program from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. five days a week. They continue attending their public schools for the sixth grade, but go to Prep for Prep classes every Wednesday evening and all day Saturday. This is followed by another summer of special schooling, after which they enter a private school. Prep for Prep continues to track the students, offering counseling and tutoring. All of the students attending private schools get aid of some kind, with more than three-quarters of them on full or nearly-full scholarships. When it comes time to choose a college, they are given assistance in applying for aid. All of the students receive some college aid, many getting full scholarships. In 1987, a similar program called Prep 9 was begun for ninth-grade students, who go off to boarding schools. Prep for Prep has a $ 1.9 million budget for its preparatory program, counseling, tutoring and administrative costs. It's covered by grants from foundations and corporations and gifts from individuals. State and city money accounts for 2 percent of the budget. About one-quarter of those accepted into Prep for Prep drop out of the 14-month program. But 95 percent of those who are accepted into private schools complete their secondary education there. This year's 46 high school seniors are headed for, among other places, <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Vassar </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mellon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Behind all of this is <PERSON> Simons </PERSON>, whose unassuming manner belies an ardent desire to change the world. In a nutshell, he's trying to produce leaders _ social, political, artistic, scientific _ from the minority community.

 `` We're looking at a society that's becoming increasingly pluralistic,'' <PERSON> Simons </PERSON> says. `` My sense is that the old standby, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dream </ORGANIZATION>, is very corny but very powerful. It undergirds our collective consciousness. `` But there is an enormous gap between the rhetoric of the American Dream and the blemished reality.'' <PERSON> Simons </PERSON> himself attended public school, albeit the rarefied halls of the <ORGANIZATION> Bronx </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION>. `` When I grew up, I never realized there was another set of schools,'' he says. As a teacher of gifted students in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Simons </PERSON> despaired of watching talented children languish in unchallenging, sometimes chaotic public schools. `` Most of those kids get destroyed long before they get to the starting gate,'' he says. Outside the classroom, `` The environment would mow them down. Peer pressure. There is a density of kids who do n't have a sense of options, and that reinforces the limitations.'' `` The public school system does n't meet the needs of the young people of the community,'' Ms. <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> says. `` Most of the children come from gifted programs or magnet schools, but they're still in very large classes. They do n't have the skills to compete at the collegiate level.'' Prep for Prep grew out of <PERSON> Simons </PERSON>' field work toward a doctorate in gifted education. He never got that degree _ work on the program swamped him, he says _ but he succeeded in proving that `` one person can have an effect on people's lives.'' <PERSON> Simons </PERSON> wants the Prep for Prep students to end up in positions where they can `` legitimately and effectively affect decisions.'' `` From their own lives, they may have a sense of how public policy most impacts those least able to influence it,'' he says. `` We want to inculcate a sense of social responsibility.'' `` They tell us, ` It's not about social welfare, it's about social change. You're capable people _ we need people in power who represent everybody,''' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Guerrero </PERSON>, a 16-year-old from the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> who graduated from <LOCATION> Fieldston </LOCATION> this spring and will attend <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> in September. Says <PERSON> Frankie </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON>, who was one of <PERSON> Simons </PERSON>' students in the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>: `` For a selected few students, he made the American Dream possible. You can say it's idealistic, but through hard work and the kind of commitment he demands, he made it successful.'' That commitment means 11 - and 12-year-olds who find their summers shot, all for an intangible goal years in the future `` I did n't feel I was losing out on anything. I felt I was gaining everything,'' says Angel Colon, a 12-year-old from <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> who will switch from P.S. 250 to <ORGANIZATION> Packer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Collegiate </ORGANIZATION> in the fall. `` But the adjustment period was tough,'' he says. `` For example, my best friend would always call me about his new comic books, his new bike. He'd say he went to the pool Friday, he went to Great Adventure Wednesday.'' His mother, <PERSON> Damaris </PERSON> <PERSON> Dumey </PERSON>, recalled his saying, `` When I'm small, why make me give up my summer?'' `` I feel the program has secured his future, academically,'' she says. `` If it was n't for this program, he would n't be on his feet today, because of the peer pressure.'' <PERSON> Luanda </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> found `` the amount of work you get every night is overwhelming. Sometimes I'm up to 11 o'clock. I think, if I make it through this, I'll go to one of the best schools and everything will work out.'' Sometimes the social adjustment is just as big. `` One of the first things that happens is their speech patterns change, they sound different,'' says <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON>, a counselor who holds sessions for the children that cover everything from etiquette to drugs to getting along with rich white kids. `` This bothers some children _ ` You're not sounding like you're supposed to,''' she says `` Their dress changes, their values change, their behavior changes. We tell them change is all right, it's natural. Do n't be afraid of it.'' <PERSON> Cherell </PERSON> <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> found she enjoys <PERSON> Dalton </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION>: `` I like the fact that they learn from you as much as you learn from them. They only know about themselves; they're learning about other cultures now.'' `` I have a lot of friends back home who are very bright, who could make it in college but are not on the right track,'' says <PERSON> Nicole </PERSON> <PERSON> Atchison </PERSON>, who came out of the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>, into Prep for Prep and on to <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION>, from which she graduated this spring. `` They do n't think they can make it, they were n't encouraged, they do n't think have enough money,'' she says. `` What Prep for Prep does is start you out on the right track.''

 <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivkind </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s immigration director who sometimes seems to be a branch of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government unto himself, angrily called a Haitian exile leader about the sign someone erected outside the <LOCATION> Krome </LOCATION> alien detention center. It read: `` <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s Concentration Camp.'' `` Does that bother you?'' asked the Rev. <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> Jean-Juste </PERSON>, the exile leader. He was assured in the strongest terms that the sign did bother <PERSON> Rivkind </PERSON>, a fervent admirer of <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and traditional <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> values, albeit he sometimes dresses in black leather and zips around town on his motorcycle. The next day, the sign had been replaced. The new one: `` <PERSON> Rivkind </PERSON>'s Concentration Camp.'' <PERSON> Rivkind </PERSON> had to laugh when he called <PERSON> Jean-Juste </PERSON> after that one. <PERSON> Jean-Juste </PERSON> was laughing, too. The priest, who has been the outspoken leader of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s Haitians for a decade, may not like <PERSON> Rivkind </PERSON>'s policies, but he likes <PERSON> Rivkind </PERSON> `` We are friends and enemies at the same time,'' <PERSON> Jean-Juste </PERSON> explains. `` We tease each other and laugh together, but when we are on business we are both devils.'' For his part, <PERSON> Rivkind </PERSON>, who recently rebuked <PERSON> Jean-Juste </PERSON> publicly for calling him `` Mr. <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>,'' promises to invite his friend <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> to his going-away party when he retires later this year after 22 years of federal government service. `` The <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Show </PERSON>,'' the ongoing exchanges between two of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s most public figures, is symptomatic of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> in the six years since <PERSON> Rivkind </PERSON> returned to his hometown from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rivkind </PERSON>, the self-styled `` bad-boy bureaucrat'' is in charge of the nation's most volatile immigration district. In dealing with Haitians, Cubans, Nicaraguans and others flooding into this immigrant city, he keeps his office door ajar and his phone lines open and runs his district like a benevolent despot, quite unlike the nation's 34 other immigration districts. `` I think <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivkind </PERSON> has been a breath of fresh air,'' says <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Kurzban </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> attorney who recently filed the latest in 10 years' worth of lawsuits challenging <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> treatment of Haitian immigrants. `` The <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> INS </LOCATION> district office has for a long time been a hotbed,'' says <PERSON> Verne </PERSON> <PERSON> Jervis </PERSON>, chief <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` It's such an international city there are an awful lot of forces at work there. It takes a real juggling act to try to carry out the immigration law.'' Under <PERSON> Rivkind </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jervis </PERSON> says, the `` INS in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> probably has more support there than ever before. His openness, the access to his office are the highest they've ever been. A number of people here at <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> headquarters certainly view him as a little bit of a maverick, but if you can do that and maintain a semblance of control and order you can get away with it.'' The 100,000 or more Haitians in the area detest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interdiction of Haitians at sea and what they see as unfair and even racist treatment. While they do n't necessarily buy <PERSON> Rivkind </PERSON>'s explanation that he's simply upholding the law and defending the nation's borders, many Haitians admire his gestures of humanity, such as his 1984 order sending immigration officers to <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> to fetch a 9-year-old Haitian boy who was deported while <PERSON> Rivkind </PERSON> was on vacation Cubans, who with more than 800,000 in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> constitute the largest <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> community anywhere except the city of <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION>, have feted <PERSON> Rivkind </PERSON> and admire his anti-communism. The immigration director says that if he were president, he'd have the Marines landing on <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>'s beaches tomorrow. Nicaraguans, more than 100,000 strong in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, like <PERSON> Rivkind </PERSON>'s aversion to sending them back to what he considers a hostile, sometimes brutal government. And many in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s other Hispanic groups like <PERSON> Rivkind </PERSON>'s `` caudillo'' - style forceful personality and decisiveness <PERSON> Rivkind </PERSON>, the 59-year-old son of <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> immigrants loves his job, the latest in a long series of federal positions. A high school dropout, he became a master's laureate, Korean War veteran and former <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> hotelier, vice cop, and county police patrolman before becoming a career federal bureaucrat. Most of his 22 federal years have been in the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in various roles, but he still recalls grimly a few months working in the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, which he found stifling.

 `` The worst thing about government is inertia. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> _ it takes so long to get anything done. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> _ they analyze everything to death,'' <PERSON> Rivkind </PERSON> says. Not so with <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbott </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivkind </PERSON>. With a dozen Nicaraguans set for deportation three years ago, <PERSON> Rivkind </PERSON> refused to send them back `` to a cowardly communist government.'' Thus, <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> became the first immigration district to stop deporting Nicaraguans while the U.S.-supported Contra rebels were fighting a guerrilla war. <PERSON> Rivkind </PERSON> today says he had been told the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> planned to change the policy. Of course, when Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Messe </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> acted, the policy already was a year old in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jervis </PERSON> said <PERSON> Rivkind </PERSON> may not always follow channels, but `` his judgment has generally been pretty good.'' <PERSON> Rivkind </PERSON>, who counts presidential son <PERSON> Jeb </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> among his close friends, admits he's not a team player, and unlike many bureaucratic colleagues does n't spend a lot of time worrying about possible negative reactions to his decisions. `` After so many years in government, so many agencies, so many experiences _ I've been to 75 countries under the <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> administration training foreign narcotics agents _ you do n't react to events, you handle them. You make decisions with ease, without overreacting, without worrying.'' Some examples: _ When two groups of young Cubans came ashore three years ago, <PERSON> Rivkind </PERSON> immediately granted them asylum and brought them up to his 11th-floor office for a news conference to talk about the terrible state of affairs under <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> _ When Everglades brush fires sent coarse smoke billowing across downtown <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> in April, most Miamians closed their windows and complained <PERSON> Rivkind </PERSON> closed the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> building, then evacuated the <LOCATION> Krome </LOCATION> detention center. For a while, he was telling television crews he was trying to hire enough buses to ship all of the more than 700 aliens, three-fourths of them Haitian, to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> INS centers. That alarmed Haitians in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and surprised <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. After a night at <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s baseball stadium, the aliens were back in <LOCATION> Krome </LOCATION>. _ When <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s lottery made a Nicaraguan a millionaire recently, questions were raised about his immigration status With the winner apparently in hiding, <PERSON> Rivkind </PERSON> granted him asylum. <PERSON> Rivkind </PERSON>'s decisions can seem hasty to some, given the national and international implications. Some people wondered whether the Cubans had demonstrated a well-founded fear of persecution, as required for political asylum, but <PERSON> Rivkind </PERSON> said they certainly would be persecuted if they were returned to their `` perverted, pathological'' government. Haitians who get here in dangerously overcrowded boats can be returned, <PERSON> Rivkind </PERSON> says, because they do n't face persecution at home. In fact, he believes the Haitian government actively encourages Haitians to go to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to get jobs for pay they can send home to relatives. As for the Nicaraguan Lotto millionaire, <PERSON> Rivkind </PERSON> says he deserved asylum because of the persecution threat. After all, <PERSON> Rivkind </PERSON> joked, he's now a capitalist and the Sandinista government persecutes capitalists. The Krome detention center, a converted <ORGANIZATION> Nike </ORGANIZATION> missile base on the edge of the <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION>, is a symbol of <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> abuse to exile activists such as <PERSON> Jean-Juste </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rivkind </PERSON> visits frequently, eats lunch with the detainees at least once a week, but says he is required by law to hold undocumented aliens there pending exclusion proceedings. `` <PERSON> Rivkind </PERSON> so managed to distance himself from the arrogant agency he works for that he was like the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> of immigration, the <ORGANIZATION> Teflon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> man,'' says <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyer </PERSON>, an attorney who presses Nicaraguan immigration claims. <PERSON> Rivkind </PERSON>, who claims unconvincingly to be surprised and flattered that a reporter wants to visit him, is ready with a thick pile of newspaper clippings and even family scrapbooks featuring his late father, <PERSON> Sam </PERSON>, a semi-pro basketball player and pioneering <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> hotelier. <PERSON> Perry </PERSON>'s older brother, <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>, is a <ORGANIZATION> Dade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge. Amid all the photos of <PERSON> Rivkind </PERSON> with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> and others, there hangs a framed photo of an idyllic scene, a placid river lined with trees and mountains near <LOCATION> Roanoke </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>. That's where he'll be a year from now, says the divorced father of two He'll be relaxing, enjoying retirement. But he'd like to do some college teaching and maybe hit the lecture circuit talking about immigration law and `` my favorite subject _ me,'' he says, laughing.

 The Confederacy's infamous Andersonville prison camp in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> marks its 125th anniversary this year. So does the Union's <LOCATION> Elmira </LOCATION> prison in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. While <PERSON> Andersonville </PERSON> remains a symbol of the inhumanities endured by prisoners in the Civil War, <LOCATION> Elmira </LOCATION> and other Northern prisons escaped that notoriety. But there is little evidence that one was any better than the other.

 Like some rusty bayonet or tattered battle flag hidden away in the attic, the <LOCATION> Elmira </LOCATION> prison camp is an all-but-forgotten relic of the Civil War. Considering the human suffering involved, maybe memories of the prison, which opened 125 years ago this month, are best left undisturbed. Except for a flagpole, a small monument and two stone markers there's nothing in the quiet <LOCATION> Elmira </LOCATION> neighborhood where the prison camp once stood to mark its presence. But buried beheath tidy rows of white headstones and shade trees at the <ORGANIZATION> Woodlawn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cemetery </ORGANIZATION> are the remains of 2,973 Confederate soldiers who died at <LOCATION> Elmira </LOCATION>, many from starvation. The Confederacy's Andersonville prison in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> is remembered as the most infamous example of the inhumanity and deprivations of the Civil War, even though records show that a soldier imprisoned in <LOCATION> Elmira </LOCATION> stood little better chance of surviving than did one in <LOCATION> Andersonville </LOCATION>. Questions linger over whether those 2,973 Rebels died mainly because of the primitive state of medicine and sanitation during the Civil War, or whether they were victims of the <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> administration's retaliatory neglect of some prisoners of war. `` Can one say that, by design, this was a death camp?'' asks <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Horigan </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Elmira </LOCATION> history teacher who spent much of the last year researching records from Civil War prison camps in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, and in the South. `` I think one can say it, but you ca n't document it. The records on this camp are very incomplete. But circumstantial evidence certainly makes it look that way.'' Union officials ordered in May 1864 that a complex of barracks at <LOCATION> Elmira </LOCATION> that had been used for three years to house Union soldiers be converted to a prison camp for captive Southerners. A 12-foot high fence was immediately thrown around a 30-acre portion of barracks. There were 35 wooden buildings in the complex, each about 100 feet long and 16 feet wide. Union officers in <LOCATION> Elmira </LOCATION> wrote the War Department that the barracks could accommodate 3,000 men comfortably and 1,000 more in a pinch. Orders came back from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that 10,000 men were to be housed in the camp. Men not lucky enough to get places in barracks would sleep in tents. Wooden barracks were n't constructed for all the men until well after winter had set in. On July 6, 1864, a train pulled into <LOCATION> Elmira </LOCATION> with the first 399-man contingent of prisoners on board. It was a ragged group of prisoners. Most had been captured during the grinding battles of the Wilderness in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. Elmirans noted that their ragtag uniforms hardly made the men look like members of the same army. Some prisoners wore only shirts and underwear. Many had no shoes. Things went wrong at the prison camp almost from the beginning. On July 15, a train loaded with 844 Confederates and 128 Union guards bound for <LOCATION> Elmira </LOCATION> smashed head-on with a coal train near <LOCATION> Shohola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa </LOCATION>. Many of the wooden cars were reduced to kindling in the accident, which killed 49 prisoners and 17 guards. Five prisoners escaped during the chaos and it took three days for some of the wounded to receive medical treatment. Meanwhile, inside the camp, a peril just as lethal though slower in its effect was taking shape. A stagnant body of water, called Foster's <LOCATION> Pond </LOCATION>, was within the fences of the prison. With so many men being sent to the camp _ there would be more than 4,400 by the end of July, 9,600 by the end of August _ the water quickly became fouled. The pond became a breeding ground of disease amid an extended heat wave that summer. Less than three weeks after <LOCATION> Elmira </LOCATION> opened, a local newspaper reported that a `` deleterious miasma'' hung over the camp due to the stagnant water. One Union surgeon called it a `` festering mass of corruption.'' Prison administrators asked the Union's commissioner general of prisoners, Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>, for permission to dig canals connecting the pond with the nearby <LOCATION> Chemung </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> to allow fresher water to pass through it. Approval for that project did n't come until October _ and prisoners did n't complete the canals until Jan. 1, 1865. `` I think this falls into the realm of circumstantial evidence,'' <PERSON> Horigan </PERSON> says. `` This is what I call the politics of delay. The sluice could have been done by August 1864.'' In the meantime, men were dying in droves. `` The scurvy was among us, and as the cold weather advanced the death rate increased rapidly,'' wrote prisoner L.B. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>. `` Scurvy, typhoid, pneumonia and finally smallpox broke out to an alarming extent, carrying off great numbers of the poor fellows.''

 <PERSON> Emory </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, a history professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION>, says doctors at <LOCATION> Elmira </LOCATION> were n't different from those practicing elsewhere during a war in which twice as many men died from disease than from battle-related wounds. `` The doctors really were n't convinced about the germ theory of disease at this point,'' he says. `` At this time they were dealing with very, very nuts-and-bolts things, like how to set a fracture properly and whether chloroform would kill and if ether was better than chloroform. These are important things, but we're not talking about great leaps forward in medical practice.'' The food at <LOCATION> Elmira </LOCATION> could have been another problem. <LOCATION> Elmira </LOCATION> prisoners after the war said a day's rations generally included two, 1-inch-thick slices of bread, 2 ounces of meat and a pint of soup, often only the thin broth in which the meat was cooked. Union officers insisted after the war that rations at <LOCATION> Elmira </LOCATION> were more generous. `` I was assured by a guard that the same rations were issued to the prisoners as to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops stationed there,'' Confederate soldier <PERSON> Erastus </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> recalled after the war. `` There seemed to me to be some bad leak in it before it got to us.'' In May 1864, Secretary of War <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanton </PERSON> had ordered that prison rations to Confederates being held in Northern camps be reduced to the same level as those Southern troops in the field were receiving. This coincided with the <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> administration's general hardening of its treatment of Southern prisoners starting that year as news began to filter north of the deprivations being endured by Union soldiers at <LOCATION> Andersonville </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Libby </LOCATION> prison in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, and other Confederate camps. <PERSON> Horigan </PERSON> calls <PERSON> Stanton </PERSON> a `` very vindictive man,'' who exercised virtual dictatorial control over the Northern prison camp system. `` <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> had very little to do with any decision-making as far as the prison-camp system was concerned,'' <PERSON> Horigan </PERSON> says. `` One of the characteristics of his presidency was that he relegated power to his cabinet members. He gave them an enormous amount of power and an enormous amount of leeway.'' Many of <LOCATION> Elmira </LOCATION>'s prisoners blamed <PERSON> Stanton </PERSON>, too. `` It is my honest opinion that Secretary <PERSON> Stanton </PERSON> did this in retaliation,'' <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> soldier <PERSON> Enos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON> later wrote of conditions at <LOCATION> Elmira </LOCATION>. `` Yes, men died in <LOCATION> Elmira </LOCATION> prison I know from hunger and want; this in a land of plenty. I was young and strong and determined I would not be carried out if I could help it, but many poor prisoners lay right down and died of hunger.'' According to figures compiled by an early-century historian of the <LOCATION> Elmira </LOCATION> prison, <PERSON> Clay </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>, 27 percent of the camp's captives died. Pulitzer Prize-winning Civil War historian <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McPherson </PERSON> places <LOCATION> Elmira </LOCATION>'s mortality rate at 24 percent. By way of comparison, 13,000 or 29 percent of the 45,000 Union soldiers imprisoned at <PERSON> Andersonville </PERSON> died. For the Civil War as a whole, 15.5 percent of the Union soldiers imprisoned in 28 Southern camps died while in captivity and 12 percent of the Confederates in 24 Northern camps died. Why, then, have <LOCATION> Elmira </LOCATION> and other Northern prisons with high death rates _ <LOCATION> Camp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, Lookout Point, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION> _ escaped <PERSON> Andersonville </PERSON>'s notoriety `` To the extent that <LOCATION> Elmira </LOCATION> and others lack infamy, I would guess it has to do with who won the war,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> says. <PERSON> Andersonville </PERSON>'s commandant, <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wirz </PERSON>, was the only soldier executed after the Civil War as a war criminal, an act that caused lingering resentment for decades among some Southerners who claimed he was made a scapegoat for the mismanagement of prison camps on both sides. And the only historic site operated by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> at a former Civil War prison camp is at <LOCATION> Andersonville </LOCATION>. Events including historic re-creations, memorial services and even an archaeological dig will be held throughout this year to mark Andersonville's 125th birthday. But <LOCATION> Elmira </LOCATION>'s anniversary will pass quietly. The chances are good that most of the people living in the well-maintained, turn-of-the-century homes around the former site of the camp wo n't give the historic significance of this year a second thought `` A lot of people from around here _ a majority of people, I'd say _ still do n't know there was a prison camp in <LOCATION> Elmira </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Decker </PERSON> says `` The people in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> know <LOCATION> Elmira </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Horigan </PERSON> says. `` They know their granddaddy was there or whatever. And quite a few compare it to Andersonville. I do n't think they're correct in doing so. Nothing else was Andersonville. `` But why we only think of <LOCATION> Andersonville </LOCATION> when we think of Civil War prison camps I do n't know. These places were bad places, all of them were. It was despicable, the way both the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and the Union treated their prisoners. It was the darkest chapter of the war.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yankee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mason </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Adams </ORGANIZATION>, sitting on the wooden deck of his <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> hillside home, is n't speculating on the future of the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> summer comedy series `` Knight and <PERSON> Daye </PERSON>.'' `` I'm in suspended animation as far as doing any more ` Knight and <PERSON> Daye </PERSON>' shows,''' says <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, who stars in the series with <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Warden </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hope </PERSON> <PERSON> Lange </PERSON>. `` We did six episodes. We'll have to see how it plays. It could come back as a mid-season replacement. But that's all speculation. The show had a preview July 8 and is scheduled to begin its regular summer run July 12. The comedy focuses on the once-famous radio act of <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Knight </PERSON> and <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Daye </PERSON>. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> is <PERSON> Daye </PERSON>, Warden is <PERSON> Knight </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lange </PERSON> is <PERSON> Daye </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON>. Knight and <PERSON> Daye </PERSON> had split up 30 years earlier when <PERSON> Knight </PERSON> made a play for <PERSON> Daye </PERSON>'s then-girlfriend, <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON>. `` I was a news writer, basically a journalist,'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> says of his character. `` I got a job at this radio station where <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Warden </PERSON> was a radio personality. When the station manager saw our names, <PERSON> Knight </PERSON> and <PERSON> Daye </PERSON>, he put us together. I was reluctant, so what it evolved into was that we were constantly in confrontation. `` When we get back together, someone says, ` Hey, they're fighting. And someone else says, ` That's what they do.' When I'm asked about our breakup I say we had a profound disagreement Actually, he was making moves on my future wife.'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, who's lived mostly in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> for the past 30 years, bought the house in <LOCATION> Bel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aire </LOCATION> when he came West to play managing editor <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hume </PERSON> in `` <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>.'' `` We never sold it and it's worked out very well. I hate living in hotels,'' he says. He and his wife, <PERSON> Margot </PERSON>, a writer, also keep a home in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. It's the third television series for <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>. Besides `` <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>,'' which ran from 1977-82, <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> also starred in `` Morningstar, Eveningstar,'' which was on briefly in 1986. But an older generation knows <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> as Pepper Young in the long-running radio soap opera `` Pepper Young's Family.'' He was the third actor to play Pepper, taking over the role in 1945 and staying until it left the air in 1959. He also had regular roles in such radio series as `` Big Town'' and `` Gasoline Alley.'' `` When I got out of college and went back home to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> I decided to earn my living as an actor instead of as a teacher,'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> says. `` Radio was a good way for an actor to make money because you could also work in the theater. But around 1960 radio passed away and many actors moved to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` I did n't want to move here permanently so I went into commercials. I established a beachhead, mostly doing voices. I prefer not to be on camera. I still do commercials for a lot of national and regional accounts.'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' mellow voice, with a hint of a rasp, is a familiar one behind commercials. He's the one who says, `` With a name like Smuckers, it has to be good.'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> was living in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> when the offer came from `` <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>,'' a spinoff of `` The <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> Show'' starring <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Asner </PERSON>. <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>, co-creator of the show, had seen <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> in `` The Deadliest Season,'' in which he played the mean owner of a hockey club. `` I'd just taken a role in ` Another World,''' he says. `` It was my first soap, but the level of actors in it is terrific. They were all Broadway actors. Then I got the call about ` <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>.' I was in a dilemma. I flew out and met with the producers. I was n't legally bound to ` Another World,' but I felt ethically bound. They very graciously gave me my release.'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> says there has been talk of doing a `` <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>'' movie, but he doubts they could ever get all the people back together again. `` I would certainly do it,'' he says. `` I think the idea of writing it is also daunting. The feeling was that the show had a few more years left when <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> yanked it off the air. So, there's no great desire to go back.'' <PERSON> Asner </PERSON>, who was involved in various liberal causes at the time, has said CBS killed the show because his political positions were controversial. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> says he likes playing the heavies in films. In the TV movie `` Under Siege,'' he was the `` lean and mean'' presidential assistant. In the theatrical movie `` F @ X,'' he was the corrupt government official. `` Playing the bad guys is fun,'' he says. `` In ` F @ X' I was bad news. A smooth and plausible guy, a high honcho in the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> who was as bent as he could possibly be. I'd love to be offered another good part like that.''

 <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Amos </PERSON> has worked as an advertising copywriter, a stand-up comic, a variety show writer-performer and even as a regular on <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>'s popular television sitcom in which he played <PERSON> Gordy </PERSON> the weatherman. But in his more than 20 years in and out of show business, the broad, powerfully built actor never appeared in a Shakespearean play. That changed recently with his portrayal of Sir <PERSON> Toby </PERSON> <PERSON> Belch </PERSON> in `` Twelfth Night,'' the opening production of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Shakespeare Festival's annual summer sojourn in Central Park. And <PERSON> Amos </PERSON> has found himself in a high-powered company of movie and theater names that includes <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldblum </PERSON>, <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Pfeiffer </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Mastrantonio </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Hines </PERSON>, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>. The actor tried out for the role at the urging of <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, a veteran of the Shakespearean repertory and one of the best Othellos of recent years. They were sitting in a trailer last year while working on the <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> movie `` Coming to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' when <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> told him, `` If you do n't try <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>, it will just loom as a bigger and more insurmountable obstacle to you. So you just might as well go ahead and take your best shot. Treat it as you would another play.'' `` I had auditioned him before for another play and did n't give him the role,'' recalls <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Papp </PERSON>, head of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Shakespeare Festival. `` But I thought, ` Gee, he's an interesting actor with an imposing figure and good clear speech.' I told him, ` You should look at Shakespeare's plays because there are many roles you could play.''' After reading parts of `` Twelfth Night'' for <PERSON> Papp </PERSON> and director <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Guskin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Amos </PERSON> got the role of fun-loving, high-spirited Sir <PERSON> Toby </PERSON>. `` My biggest concern was that I did n't develop an affected accent,'' <PERSON> Amos </PERSON> recounts. <PERSON> Amos </PERSON>, born in <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, did n't start out to be an actor. His big dream was to play football, but nothing came of it. His acting career did n't get going until he moved to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. `` My entree into show business came because of my writing. During the day, I was working for an advertising agency in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. At night, I was moonlighting on a local television variety show called ` <PERSON> Lohman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barkley </PERSON>' as a writer-performer. We'd do 90 minutes of contemporary comedy and satirical bits.'' Out of that job came a position as a staff writer on `` The <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Uggams </PERSON> Show,'' a short-lived variety show on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> in 1969. On it, <PERSON> Amos </PERSON> helped write what he calls a forerunner of today's situation comedies about middle-class blacks. It was a 15-minute segment called `` Sugar Hill,'' in which Miss <PERSON> Uggams </PERSON> played the wife, <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> <PERSON> Kilpatrick </PERSON> her husband and <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> her brother. `` ` Sugar Hill' taught me a great deal about the structure of situation comedy,'' he says now. `` So that later, when I got involved in performing in a situation comedy, I felt I had a slight edge on some of the other actors.'' His job on `` The <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Uggams </PERSON> Show'' won <PERSON> Amos </PERSON> a role the following year on a new comedy series starring <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>. His role of <PERSON> Gordy </PERSON> the weatherman was his first national recognition. <PERSON> Amos </PERSON> had studied acting at a small theater in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> but he likes to think he honed his acting skills working as a stand-up comic in clubs in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> in the late'60s. `` I was n't very good,'' he says now. `` But it's the best training any actor can get, particularly if you use your own material. Then you can gauge whether or not your perception of what's funny is funny to the general public.'' <PERSON> Amos </PERSON> lived in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> for about 15 years before coming back to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. He was able to support himself by occasional television series like `` The Tim Conway Comedy Hour'' and `` Future Cop'' as well as commercials. But he returned to the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> seven years ago to do more theater. `` I had started to loose my hustle,'' he says. `` I'm not the kind of guy who can just lie by the pool waiting for my agent to call.'' Last year, <PERSON> Amos </PERSON> became artistic director and artist-in-residence for a theater located in the <ORGANIZATION> Grant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Avenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Plainfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, after its mayor, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, asked him to do a few fund-raisers. He also staged the theater's first offering, `` Forever My Darling,'' a play by <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>. It takes place in the 1950s and concerns four black women who want to become the first female rhythm and blues singing group. <PERSON> Amos </PERSON> has even optioned the movie rights. Work on commercial projects like the upcoming <PERSON> Sylvester </PERSON> <PERSON> Stallone </PERSON> movie `` Lock-Up'' gives <PERSON> Amos </PERSON> the financial freedom to spend more with his fledgling theater. `` I think I'm pretty much living the ideal life _ staying here in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, so I can be close to my theater, doing, I hope, one picture a year and as much stage work as possible,'' he says. `` That's the best of both worlds.''

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> spends most of his time these days trying to sweep away the image of a brutal, repressive government. He's even been saying neither he nor his close associates ever were Marxists. In his heavily guarded suite in the presidential palace, <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> is trying to build a new image not only for his government but also for himself, repudiating almost everything about the 1978 revolution that installed a pro-Soviet regime in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. He has been brushing off the Marxist tag for himself and his associates on the ruling Politburo ever since Soviet troops withdrew in February. He talks about subjects that once were taboo _ the `` big mistakes'' made before he assumed power in May 1986, `` half-baked'' land and education reform policies launched by his predecessors in the early years of power. `` During the past 11 years the revolution has traversed a difficult, complicated and dangerous path with shortcomings, haste and hurry,'' he said in a recent interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` We have learned big lessons of history. The passage of time is a great teacher.'' Since the last Soviet troops withdrew Feb. 15, <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> has adopted a position that at times sounds as though he would be willing to step down and leave his <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Afghanistan </ORGANIZATION> with only a slim guarantee of existence. Although the party is communist in structure with a standard politburo, central committee and youth organization, it advocates a free-market system and accepts the Islamic religion. Its meetings begin with readings from the Koran, the Islamic holy book, and <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> is a regular at Friday prayers and often invokes the name of God in his speeches. <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> says he only seeks the `` 16th seat'' at the negotiating table with the seven Moslem guerrilla groups based in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and the eight in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> that are trying to topple his government. He says he's ready to negotiate with the Moslem guerrillas, through intermediaries, if necessary _ anywhere, anytime and on any terms. But the most extreme of the guerrilla leaders and their main supporters, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, have taken the position that <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> and key members of his government must go before they talk peace. They contend the government trampled on ancient social and religious traditions and created chaos by opening the way for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s military intervention in December 1979. Some of the Moslem guerrillas say they now would favor a negotiated settlement, but the guerrilla government-in-exile, formed in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> after the Soviet withdrawal, still insists <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> must go even if it means more military action. <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> says he would resign but maintains that would not end the conflict, which has already claimed more than 1.3 million lives, destroyed thousands of villages and forced 5 million people _ one-third of the population _ into exile in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. `` The departure of a personality or force will not solve <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s problems,'' the 43-year-old president said in the interview. `` That can only be done by sitting down at the table and talking.'' His appeals at times exhibit an air of desperation, but most diplomats in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> doubt his government is on the verge of military or political collapse. On the contrary, they say, <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s departure could mean that any coalition government would not survive because neither members of his party nor the guerrilla leaders have his power and authority. The government has been strengthened by a continuing Soviet airlift of arms and ammunition. The Soviets have promised to stand by the <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> government even though the supply costs are enormous, believed to be about $ 2 billion a year. <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s soldiers also have been strong and predictions that they would join the rebels and that the government would collapse after the Soviet withdrawal have not proved true. `` Who is strong and who is weak?'' <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> said. `` Months have gone by and we're still here. And a year from now, we'll still be here.'' With the Soviet troops gone, Afghans are looking to this summer as a season when the government and the guerrillas may finally talk peace. They yearn for a political settlement that would end daily hardships. Long lines form daily outside bakeries and gasoline stations. Meat and vegetable prices have skyrocketed as high as 10 times last year's. Inflation is running at 215 percent, and wages have been frozen. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, which also backed the guerrillas, are moving toward supporting a negotiated settlement. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> have questioned <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s policy on <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The guerrillas, they say, lack the battlefield prowess to defeat the government troops and are so divided among themselves they would be unable to form a stable government. But the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which allocated an estimated $ 600 million in weapons and other aid to the rebels, says the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government disqualified itself from talks about <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s future with the terror and destruction that was carried out at its behest. Rebel leaders claim at least 75,000 people have been killed by <ORGANIZATION> KHAD </ORGANIZATION>, the Soviet-style secret police, since the Marxists seized power April 27, 1978. <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>, a physician, headed <ORGANIZATION> KHAD </ORGANIZATION> for six years before he was picked in May 1986 to succeed <PERSON> Babrak </PERSON> <PERSON> Karmal </PERSON>, now believed to be living in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` I see no reason to rehash the past,'' <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> replied when asked about KHAD. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> once headed a similar organization'' _ the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> _ `` and now he's president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' But <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s government has started to speak about terror against its opponents. So far, most of the talk is confined to the first 20 months of the revolutionary regime in 1978-79, when <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> was ambassador to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Power during that time was held by <PERSON> Nur </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Taraki </PERSON>, who was smothered with a pillow in a party feud in September 1979 and whose successor, <PERSON> Hafizullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Amin </PERSON>, was assassinated shortly after the Soviet troops arrived. Government officials say only about 1,000 political prisoners remain in <LOCATION> Pol-e-Charki </LOCATION> prison on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. They say executions, except those ordered by the courts, have stopped. Diplomats from both <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and Western nations say they see no evidence that summary executions continue. The guerrillas, however, contend <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> still holds 12,000 to 15,000 political prisoners, a figure accepted by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>. `` There have been improvements in the situation. We're not saying we never made mistakes,'' says <PERSON> Najmuddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Kawyani </PERSON>, a Politburo member and secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` Prison is not a good thing for anyone,'' said the 42-year-old <PERSON> Kawyani </PERSON>, who was jailed briefly with <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> for throwing stones at Vice President <PERSON> Spiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Agnew </PERSON>'s car when he visited <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in 1969 and then for 16 months during <PERSON> Amin </PERSON>'s reign. However, <PERSON> Kawyani </PERSON> argues, the guerrillas were equally as guilty of atrocities, killing civil servants and government soldiers who tried to switch sides but were suspected of being informants. `` Why is the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> keeping mum on human rights violations by the mujahedeen?'' he said.

 More and more Moslem rebels are saying they would welcome a political solution to the 11-year-old civil war in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. `` We hope the battle for <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> is the last battle in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Massoud </PERSON>, a writer for the <ORGANIZATION> Afghan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resource </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, a pro-rebel news agency partially funded by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The rebels, called mujahedeen or Islamic `` holy warriors,'' have fought government forces to a stalemate at <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, in eastern <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, since Soviet troops ended more than nine years of involvement in the country Feb. 15. Casualties are estimated in the thousands, making it one of the bloodiest battles of the war. The most extreme of the Moslem fundamentalist guerrilla leaders, however, want no part of a peace agreement that does not give power to their self-proclaimed `` interim'' Afghan government, a cabinet-in-exile composed of a seven-party mujahedeen alliance with headquarters in this Pakistani frontier city. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> backs the rebels with help from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and shelters more than 3 million Afghan war refugees. Critics of the guerrilla regime, formed in February, charge that it is not representative of the majority of Afghans. A large number of anti-government Afghans favor the return from exile of their former monarch, King <PERSON> Zahir </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON>, to head a transitional administration that would guide the country to peace. <PERSON> Zahir </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> was ousted in 1973 by the military, which then established the republic that was overthrown by the Marxists in 1978. <PERSON> Rasul </PERSON> <PERSON> Sayyaf </PERSON>, prime minister of the mujahedeen government and leader of the hardline <ORGANIZATION> Ittehad-i-Islami </ORGANIZATION> rebel party, rails at proposals for a negotiated settlement. `` It should be clear that any attempt to solve the Afghan issue against the wishes and decisions of the mujahedeen will not only be futile but would also have negative repercussions on <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and the region as a whole,'' he said in a statement issued from his <LOCATION> Peshawar </LOCATION> office. `` If the world community wants to end bloodshed in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> they should put pressure on the Russians to stop ... propping up a regime which is totally unacceptable to the Afghan nation.'' Some rebel leaders say they are stockpiling weapons and planning attacks on <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, the Afghan capital, and other key cities. The guerrilla offensives that usually herald winter's end have n't happened this year, except for the attempt to take <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> `` No one wants to fight,'' said <PERSON> Massoud </PERSON>, who uses only one name. `` Everyone wants a peaceful solution. <PERSON> Zahir </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> does have popularity as opposed to rebel leaders who want a military solution.'' But one Afghan intellectual, who asked not to be identified, said an alternative to <PERSON> Zahir </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> would be to have Afghan politicians who belonged to earlier non-communist cabinets take over until elections, monitored by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, can be held.

<HEAD>Eds: This item will be released with the Supreme Court's abortion
decision.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Here is a chronology of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s major abortion decisions: _ 22, 1973. In <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>, the court for the first time legalized abortion nationwide. The court, in an opinion by Justice <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON>, based its 7-2 ruling on a woman's constitutional right to privacy. The court said a woman's decision to have an abortion during the first three months of pregnancy must be left to her and her doctor. It said states may impose certain regulations during the second trimester to protect the woman's health, and may take steps to protect fetal life in the third trimester. State authority to regulate abortions after the first trimester was not made absolute, however. _ Jan 22, 1973. In <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Bolton </PERSON>, the court that same day struck down by a 7-2 vote restrictions on facilities that could be used to perform abortions. The decision gave rise to a new kind of medical facility, the abortion clinic. _ July 1, 1976 In Planned Parenthood vs. <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON>, the court, by a 6-3 vote, said states can not give husbands veto power over their pregnant wives' decision to abort their pregnancies. By a 5-4 vote, the court said that neither can parents of minor, unwed girls be given an absolute veto over abortions. _ June 20, 1977 In <PERSON> Maher </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Roe </PERSON>, the court ruled 6-3 that states have no legal obligation to pay for `` non-therapeutic'' abortions. _ Jan 9, 1979. In <LOCATION> Colautti </LOCATION> vs. <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>, reached by a 6-3 vote, the court reaffirmed its intention to give doctors broad discretion in determining the timing of `` fetal viability'' _ when a fetus can live outside the mother's womb. The justices said states may seek to protect a fetus that has reached viability, but the determination is up to doctors, not courts or legislatures. _ July 2, 1979 In <PERSON> Bellotti </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Baird </PERSON>, the court by an 8-1 vote elaborated on its parental consent decision of 1976. It implied that states may be able to require a pregnant, unmarried minor to obtain parental consent to an abortion so long as the state law provides an alternative procedure to parental approval, such as letting the minor seek a state judge's approval instead. _ June 30, 1980 In <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> McRae </PERSON>, the so-called Hyde Amendment was upheld by a 5-4 vote. The court said the federal government and individual states are under no legal obligation to pay for even medically necessary abortions sought by women receiving welfare. _ March 23, 1981 In H.L. vs. <PERSON> Matheson </PERSON>, the court ruled by a 6-3 vote that states may require doctors consulted by some girls _ those still dependent on their parents and too `` immature'' to decide such matters for themselves _ to try to inform parents before performing a requested abortion. _ June 15, 1983 In three decisions called City of <LOCATION> Akron </LOCATION> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Akron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reproductive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, Planned Parenthood of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> vs. <PERSON> Ashcroft </PERSON> and <PERSON> Simopolous </PERSON> vs. <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, the court, in a 6-3 ruling, said states and local communities may not require that all abortions for women more than three months pregnant be performed in a hospital. The court also struck down regulations that, among other things, imposed a 24-hour waiting period between the signing of an abortion consent form and the medical procedure and required doctors to tell women seeking an abortion that a fetus is a `` human life.'' _ June 11, 1986 In <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> vs. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Obstetricians </ORGANIZATION> and Gynecologists, the court voted 5-4 to strike down <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> abortion regulations somewhat similar to those it invalidated in 1983. The court said states may not require doctors to inform women seeking abortions about potential risks and about available medical assistance benefits for prenatal care and childbirth. In that decision, the court also struck down requirements that doctors performing third-trimester abortions, which are rare, use procedures least risky to a fetus capable of surviving outside the womb, and that two doctors always be present for abortions performed in the third trimester. Also invalidated was a regulation requiring doctors to make a record, which could become available to the public, of every abortion they perform. _ Dec 14, 1987. In <PERSON> Hartigan </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Zbaraz </PERSON>, the court split 4-4. The effect was to invalidate an <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> law that could have made abortions more difficult to obtain for some teen-agers. The decision was announced two months before Justice <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> joined the court and replaced Justice <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, who had retired the previous June.

<DATELINE>JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Missouri's abortion statute quickly drew a legal attack after it passed in 1986 and a federal court blocked its implementation even before it took effect. That was what supporters wanted. The law was passed with the intention of making it a vehicle for challenging the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> decision of 1973, which legalized abortions. The Missouri case drew national attention, and a flood of briefs for and against abortion poured into the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, which heard arguments on the issue last April. The law, drafted with the help of the <ORGANIZATION> Missouri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, was the <ORGANIZATION> Missouri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>'s third effort to restrict abortions since the 1973 decision. Parts of a 1974 law enacted to get around <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> were overturned by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in 1976. Another law requiring that abortions during the fourth to sixth months of pregnancy be conducted in hospitals was overturned in 1983. The <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> voted overwhelmingly to pass the latest law, which restricted the availability of abortions and defined life as beginning at conception. State Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>, a Democrat who was one of the law's sponsors, said legislators intentionally passed a measure that would be challenged, so that the abortion issue could be reviewed by the current <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, seen as more conservative than the one that decided <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> Republican Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashcroft </PERSON>, a strong abortion opponent, signed the bill, which was to have taken effect Aug. 13, 1986. But Reproductive Health Services of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, Planned Parenthood of <LOCATION> Greater </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and others filed suit in July in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> seeking to overturn the law. On July 31, 1986, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> ordered the state not to enforce the statute until the lawsuit could be heard. A four-day trial was held the following December. The case became known as `` Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services,'' after one of the plaintiffs and <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> struck down major portions of the law in March 1987, and the state appealed to the 8th <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. The appeals court struck down most of the law last July, saying it conflicted with <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>. In addition to declaring that human life begins at conception, the law said no public funds, employees or facilities could be used to perform or assist in an abortion or to counsel a woman to have an abortion. The appeals court upheld a provision in the law banning the use of taxpayer money for performing or assisting an abortion. But it ruled use of a public facility or the services of a public employee could not be banned if all such costs were reimbursed by a patient. The appeals court also threw out the definition of life beginning at conception, saying it was unconstitutional for a state to adopt one theory of when human life begins. Among the record 78 friend-of-the court briefs filed with the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> was one signed by 127 <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> lawmakers asking the justices to uphold the state's law and allow each state to determine what its abortion laws should be. According to that brief, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> passed its first abortion law in 1825, and from 1835 until 1973 the state prohibited abortions except when necessary to save the mother's life. The <ORGANIZATION> Missouri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> says 17,382 abortions were performed statewide last year, 17,574 in 1987, 19,039 in 1986 and 19,482 in 1985. It says all the abortions were performed in private facilities.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Throughout the 1980s, about 1.5 million abortions have been performed on <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> women each year, according to a private survey. The number climbed steadily after the 1973 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision legalizing abortion _ from about 750,000 to more than a million by 1976, the survey showed. Who are the women seeking and obtaining abortions? The following statistics have been reported by <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guttmacher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, a New York-based organization that studies reproductive issues: _ Women in their 20s obtain more than half of all reported abortions, about 55 percent About 24 percent are obtained by teen-agers _ 14 percent by those aged 18 or 19. _ About 42 percent are obtained by <ORGANIZATION> Protestants </ORGANIZATION>; about 31 percent by <PERSON> Catholics </PERSON> Less than 2 percent are obtained by Jewish women. About 22 percent of those obtaining abortions belong to no religious denomination. _ Women with family incomes below $ 11,000 accounted for one-third of all abortions That group comprises about 29 percent of all women of child-bearing age. _ White women have 68.6 percent of all abortions But non-white women, who make up 16.7 percent of the childbearing-age population, have 31.4 percent of all abortions. _ About 63 percent of the women obtaining abortions are unmarried _ Unmarried women living with a man constitute 17.4 percent of the abortion clients They make up only 3.4 percent of all childbearing-age women. _ Women attending school, who number about one-fifth of the childbearing-age population, obtain 31 percent of the abortions each year

<TEXT>
 Computers, oil wells and children scurrying with school bags have replaced assault rifles, rubble and teen-age combat soldiers in <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION>, a nation that has seen little but strife and war since independence from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1960. With the guns silent since 1987 except for a few lingering skirmishes, the central African nation has begun to tackle the monumental problems of economic survival and development. Until very recently, international and bilateral aid programs were here to distribute emergency food to relieve hunger and counter other effects of guerrilla war and conflict with neighboring <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, as well as a disastrous drought in 1984. Now they are here to extend aid for long-term economic recovery. The computers, incongruous in a country where 85 percent of the estimated 5 million people are subsistence farmers and less than a quarter of all children attend school, are playing an essential role. A senior official for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> USAID </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- said the computers gather the information that allows the most effective allocation of resources. Computer programmers funded by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> USAID </ORGANIZATION>, for example, plan to help the government of President <PERSON> Hissene </PERSON> <PERSON> Habre </PERSON> conduct the nation's first census next year. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> gave $ 18.57 million in bilateral economic aid to <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION> this year, while all foreign assistance in 1987 amounted to $ 200 million. Much of the aid helped the government pay operating costs and salaries of civil servants, teachers and public officials. <PERSON> Gueralbaye </PERSON> <PERSON> Koumadoum </PERSON>, a 37-year-old secondary school teacher who worked without pay in the worst years of the war and its aftermath, began to receive his full monthly salary, the equivalent of $ 368, in January. `` Things are much better now,'' he said. `` But many students ca n't afford things like paper and pens, and owning a book is a real luxury.'' Just for shared textbooks parents must pay $ 8 a month for each primary school child and $ 16 for every secondary school student. A landlocked country that has long been an East-West crossroads in the heart of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION> is classified by the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> as one of the world's 10 poorest nations. Its annual per capita income is $ 125. When the bottom dropped out of the world cotton market four years ago, <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION>, the largest producer of cotton in west and central <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, lost nearly half its normal foreign currency revenue. One bright spot now is oil, with reports that two wells have begun limited production. Neither the government nor representatives of <ORGANIZATION> Esso </ORGANIZATION>, which operates a concession north of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION>, would confirm or deny the reports. A World Bank-financed micro-refinery is expected to produce most of the petroleum the country needs by the early 1990s. Enough petroleum to meet almost 50 percent of <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION>'s needs is now smuggled from neighboring <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>, the remainder imported through legal channels. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, the single most important donor, this year provided <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION> with $ 83.3 million in budgetary support, technical assistance and development and military aid. According to figures from private French sources, <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION> has only 13,000 salaried employees. About 7,000 houses and offices are hooked up to electric power lines and 10,000 have water meters. Ten percent of the government's current $ 83.5-million budget comes from taxes levied on the sale of Gala beer, one of the country's leading manufactured products. Despite the monetary poverty, the towns and villages of <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION> do not seem mired in the misery that characterizes many other African cities. `` I know it's a contradiction,'' said <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> <PERSON> Berriot </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> representative, `` but although <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION> is among the poorest of the African countries, the life is not nearly as miserable as elsewhere on the continent.'' Government figures indicate this year's harvest of cereal grains, including mainstays millet and sorghum, will reach 800,000 tons, about enough to make <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION> self-sufficient in food, President <PERSON> Habre </PERSON> said in a June 7 speech marking his seventh year in power. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, which has provided $ 156 million in aid since 1984, says in its latest report that `` the overwhelming impression is that Chadian entrepreneurs have a wealth of ideas and dynamic entrepreneurial spirit'' but are severely hampered by a shortage of capital and technology. Since 1982 when <PERSON> Habre </PERSON> defeated rival armed factions and declared himself head of state, much of <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION>'s foreign aid has been in grants or nearly interest-free loans. In 1979, civil war broke out among the 11 groups that made up the shaky Government of <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. This was complicated in late 1980 by the incursion of Libyan troops on the side of <PERSON> Goukouni </PERSON> <PERSON> Oueddei </PERSON>, <PERSON> Habre </PERSON>'s chief rival for power and one of the major belligerants. The Libyans withdrew suddenly in November 1981, leaving <PERSON> Goukouni </PERSON> seriously weakened. In June 1982, <PERSON> Habre </PERSON>'s forces entered <LOCATION> N'Djamena </LOCATION>, bringing the main war to an end. But sporadic fighting among rebellious army units continued in the south until early 1985, and <PERSON> Goukouni </PERSON>'s Libyan-backed forces in north finally were defeated in July 1987 with the help of French ground and air forces sent to <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION> in 1983.

 Reports still crop up periodically, however, of skirmishes between government troops and what are described as `` rebels.''

Since <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> came to power 20 years ago, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> has been enmeshed in <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION>'s internal affairs, supporting a rainbow of anti-government factions and tendencies over the years. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> publication on aid to <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION> says 7,000 Libyan troops remain in the <LOCATION> Aouzou </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, a 45,600-square-mile area between the two countries occupied by <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> since 1973. The publication adds that <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION>'s `` continued resistence to Libyan aggression helps contain <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'s expansionist ambitions, curb its aggression and terrorism and reduce Libyan prestige and influence in sub-Saharan <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION> is strategically situated between <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> to the north and <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> to the south and between <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> west </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> in the east. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which has backed <PERSON> Habre </PERSON> ever since <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> sent troops into <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION> in 1980, furnishes military aid to <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chadian </LOCATION> military personnel train in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Habre </PERSON> says, a committee of leading Chadians was putting the finishing touches on a draft constitution that he hoped would be put to a vote before the end of the year. The document, he added, would `` provide a more solid basis for democratic rights in <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION>.'' Despite economic problems, some Chadians are optimistic. Among them are <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamid </PERSON>, a 20-year-old shepherd, and his grandmother, <PERSON> Fatima </PERSON>, who look forward to the paving of a road running out of <LOCATION> N'Djamena </LOCATION>. The house from which they make their living selling goat cheese is on the road 12 miles northwest of the capital. `` There's no point in moving to town to sell because then people wo n't think our cheese is fresh,'' <PERSON> Hamid </PERSON> said. `` So when the road is done, people can come to us all year round and not worry about the rains.'' Even in <LOCATION> N'Djamena </LOCATION> the streets turn to mud in the rainy season. Health is another area where international aid has come into play. Dr. <PERSON> Issaline </PERSON> <PERSON> Greindl </PERSON>, a Belgian specialist in tropical medicine, is using computers in a <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> University-sponsored project to identify <PERSON> Chad </PERSON>'s major health problems and allocate resources. `` In 1985 no one even knew how many health facilities there were in the country,'' she said, `` but now we are receiving about 310 standardized reports a month which represents about 90 percent of the facilities.'' <PERSON> Chad </PERSON>'s basic health problems are fevers, including malaria, respiratory problems and diarrhea, either avoidable or treatable with minimum infrastructure and medication. The average life expectancy still is in the mid-30s, but in statistical health reports anyone who survives past the age of 5 is considered an adult.

 `` True Believer'' -LRB- RCA-Columbia Home Video. VHS-Beta, $ 89.95. Rated R -RRB- `` True Believer'' is fun to watch. Unfortunately, it is not believable. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> plays, with his trademark intensity, <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, a pioneering civil rights lawyer who lost his 1960s spirit on the way to the'80s. He finds himself defending mostly drug dealers, and defending himself for doing so. Along comes a young lawyer, <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> -RRB-, who worships <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>'s earlier work, and an 8-year-old murder case in which the defendant might actually be innocent. <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> is reluctant to take the case, and <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> sneers, `` It was close, huh? We almost defended someone who was n't a drug dealer.'' But <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> plunges into the case, and he also finds he's fighting public corruption and various urban evils. The problem with the movie, directed by <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruben </PERSON>, is that instead of taking a close look at <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>'s disillusionment, or at the relationship between <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> and <PERSON> Roger </PERSON>, `` True Believer'' takes the easy way out and goes for the thrills. For starters, the old murder is recreated, <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> is beaten up by a phony white supremacist, and there's a crazy and dangerous chase through a plumbing supply factory. On the good side, the ending is clever. <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> is fine, as is <PERSON> Yuji </PERSON> <PERSON> Okumoto </PERSON> playing the convict and <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> as a private detective. _ By <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> MacVean </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 `` The Midnight Hour'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Vidmark </ORGANIZATION>, VHS-Beta, $ 89.95 -RRB- `` The Midnight Hour'' is a good little vampire, witches and ghouls tale starring <PERSON> Shari </PERSON> <PERSON> Belafonte-Harper </PERSON> as a witch who brings terror to a small town on <LOCATION> Halloween </LOCATION>. Although there are recognizable names in the movie, the acting leaves much to be desired. Co-starring are: <PERSON> Levar </PERSON> <PERSON> Burton </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Patten </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jonelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dedee </PERSON> <PERSON> Pfeifer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>. And for a horror flick, the chills are as lacking as the thespian skills. Nonetheless, it is still an enjoyable romp as the the town's cemetery residents climb out of their graves and munch, rip and mutilate their way through the night, joining trick-or-treaters and crashing a halloween party The game then becomes how to get the baddies back in the grave and the townsfolk back to normal. Along the way, there are a few chuckles. And despite all its flaws, `` The Midnight Hour'' is an adequate little horror flick for a rainy Saturday afternoon. _ By <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> French </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer

 `` The Telluride Sessions'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ Strength in Numbers Innovation and bluegrass are uneasy companions. But the all-star band Strength in Numbers is proof that the banjo, dobro, bass, fiddle and mandolin can break new ground. `` The Telluride Sessions'' combines bluegrass instrumentation with New Age melodies and classical-music arrangements, and the result is a pleasure to hear. These guys are n't just any pickers. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on mandolin and <PERSON> Bela </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleck </PERSON> on banjo are members of the New Grass Revival, one of the best progressive bluegrass bands. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> -LRB- on fiddle, guitar and mandolin -RRB-, <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> -LRB- dobro -RRB- and <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> -LRB- bass -RRB- are also terrific instrumentalists. But for their first record together, these inventive virtuosos decided to emphasize ensemble playing rather than solos. Themes are developed by unusual instrumental combinations _ two violins and a bowed bass, for example, on the beautiful `` One Winter's Night.'' Counterpoint and dynamics, rarely important in bluegrass music, are explored to great effect. The band has a lot of fun with syncopation, too. `` The Telluride Sessions'' is n't without dazzling solos. O'Connor -LRB- on guitar -RRB- and <PERSON> Fleck </PERSON> play with breathless speed on `` Slopes.'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> stage a mandolin duel on `` <LOCATION> Macedonia </LOCATION>.'' But the star of record may be its most unheralded participant. <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> performs tricks on the bass that will leave listeners shaking their head, and he had a hand in most of the strongest compositions, including the good-humored `` Pink Flamingos'' and the pensive `` No Apologies.'' _ By <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Wine </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Agnes </PERSON> <PERSON> Varda </PERSON> compares filmmaking to cutting open an apple and seeing what's inside. She likes to find fresh ways to examine everyday life. One of the most influential directors of the French New Wave, the 61-year-old <PERSON> Varda </PERSON> has depicted a young carpenter torn between two women -LRB- `` Happiness'' -RRB-, a drifter amidst the peasants and bums of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> -LRB- `` Vagabond'' -RRB- and the friendship of two women over 15 years -LRB- `` One Sings, the Other Does n't'' -RRB-. Sometimes her films are broad in scope; `` Salut les Cubains'' -LRB- `` Salute the Cubans'' -RRB- is a 1963 documentary of the Cuban Revolution, and `` The Black Panthers'' examines the radical 1960s organization. In `` Cleo From 5 to 7,'' a pseudo-documentary of two hours in the life of a glamorous pop singer who may have cancer, she focuses on the tiniest details. Her new film, `` Kung Fu Master,'' is a different view altogether: a love triangle involving a 15-year-old boy, a 40-year-old woman and a brand new video game. The idea was suggested to <PERSON> Varda </PERSON> by her friend <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Birkin </PERSON>, who stars as 40-year-old <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>. `` Do you know how love begins between people, between human beings?'' <PERSON> Varda </PERSON> asked. `` Love is made up of a series of bad or good reasons which come to a point. `` Maybe she's lonely at the time. She's had two husbands. Maybe she likes the boy as a mother. Maybe nobody's looking at her and that little boy looks at her. Maybe she wants to go back to her own adolescence. There are many reasons at that moment of her life.'' <PERSON> Birkin </PERSON> is married to the French director <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Demy </PERSON>, and their son, <PERSON> Mathieu </PERSON>, portrays the young boy whose interest in <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> is balanced by his passion for the `` Kung Fu Master'' video game. `` It's the last days of a child,'' <PERSON> Varda </PERSON> said. `` The last months of being not yet a man. The feeling that it's coming and it's not yet there. There's a real frustration at that age. They want so much to be men, and it's not yet here.'' <PERSON> Varda </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> Ixelles </LOCATION>, a suburb of <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, and went to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> after World War II to pursue classical studies at the <ORGANIZATION> Lycee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Victor-Duruy </ORGANIZATION>. Courses at the Ecole du Louvre stimulated her interest in painting and sculpture and she also took night classes at the <ORGANIZATION> Vaugirard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Photography </ORGANIZATION>. In 1951, she was appointed official photographer of the Theatre National Populaire, and remained in that position for the next decade. During that time, she made her debut film. Though <PERSON> Varda </PERSON> had no interest in film as a child, she remembered having a `` head full of movie images'' and decided to write a scenario. She rented a house on the coast and filmed `` La Pointe Courte,'' released in 1955. The film took its title from a fishing village to which a young man and his Parisian wife return, hoping to save their marriage. <PERSON> Varda </PERSON> contrasted the young couple's story with the local villagers' struggle to survive, eventually linking the two seemingly disparate ways of life She deliberately used a real fishing village, wanting to give the film the look of a documentary. `` I've always been using reality as a texture to understand better. I like for stories to look true.'' Although a failure at the box office, `` La Pointe Courte'' was a major influence on other <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> directors, notably <PERSON> Alain </PERSON> <PERSON> Resnais </PERSON>, who edited the movie and cited it as an influence on his 1959 classic, `` <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION> Mon Amour.'' She made several documentary shorts, but inadequate funds prevented <PERSON> Varda </PERSON> from making her next feature, `` Cleo From 5 to 7,'' until 1961. Backed by French businessman <PERSON> Georges </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Beauregard </PERSON>, who had supported <PERSON> Jean-Luc </PERSON> <PERSON> Godard </PERSON>'s `` Breathless,'' the film studied <PERSON> Cleo </PERSON>'s evolvement from a shallow pop star to an authentic human being capable of understanding pain in herself and others `` Cleo'' was again praised by critics and was a commercial success as well, building anticipation for `` Happiness,'' which won the Silver Bear award at the 1965 <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Festival and used <PERSON> Mozart </PERSON> for background music. `` I'm full of cliches like everybody,'' the filmmaker said. `` I used <PERSON> Mozart </PERSON>'s music because he gives me that feeling of happiness and death. It's never intellectual, I just feel strongly about it.'' Her biggest success since came in 1985 with `` Vagabond,'' which earned raves for young <PERSON> Sandrine </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonnaire </PERSON>, who played the title role. `` Vagabond,'' like much of <PERSON> Varda </PERSON>'s best work, managed to fund humor and hope in even the grimmest aspects of life. `` I'll never be a bum, I hope, but I could be near them enough so I can speak to them and let them express feelings of anger and put them in the film,'' <PERSON> Varda </PERSON> said. `` It's not a documentary, but I could approach them enough to not betray them, not make them ridiculous or too much to take. Just show what they are. `` She -LRB- Bonnaire -RRB- is a survivor, not a victim. Life is varied; it ca n't be totally sad.''

<HEAD>The Artists: Theme Parks May Become Museums of the Future</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By REBECCA MARTIN EVARTS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BARCELONA, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Museums of the future will have to draw more on Walt Disney than the Renaissance if they are to attract visitors, ensure sources of funding and survive competition from theme parks. `` Museums must change from self-centered to client-centered environments,'' says <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>, director of the Canadian <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civilization </ORGANIZATION>. `` They must market themselves not only as educational but also as meaningful leisure-time activity.'' <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> was one of half a dozen experts who spoke at a recent symposium on museums sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Caixa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pensions </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> and the Cultural Olympics, part of the 1992 Summer Olympics organized by the city of <LOCATION> Barcelona </LOCATION>. People already spend more time on visits to theme parks than on trips to museums _ an average of eight hours as compared to 50 minutes, according to statistics provided at the symposium. But interest in museums appears to be on the increase, said <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>, director of the European Museum of the Year Award. He added, however, that government and foundation funding, on which so many museums depend, is shrinking as public budgets are tightened and costs rise, forcing them to become more self-supporting. Museums of the future will have to borrow techniques from the successful theme parks such as extensive sensory stimulation through lights, graphics and color as well as live performances, constant change and updating of attractions, film presentations on giant screens and attractive boutiques selling related merchandise. But museums need not sacrifice their traditional role of educating and providing well-researched and accurate information, <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> said, when improving on attention to the needs and interests of their visitors. Many museum curators would put up enormous resistance to such changes, he acknowledged. `` They have comfortable niches there, and they do n't like the earth trembling under their feet,'' <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> said. `` But I think the future is equally bleak if they do n't respond because their funding will shrink every year, and eventually they'll be running empty museums with no operating budget.'' <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. King, a specialist in American popular culture at <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Thomas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jefferson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said part of the change will require museums to fuse popular culture with the elite culture that has been their traditional domain. In order to attract visitors inside, the experts said, museums of the future will have to offer greatly expanded leisure facilities such as full-service restaurants, theaters, conference facilities and reception rooms big enough to accommodate weddings or perfume and other marketing launches. And they will have to be visually exciting and welcoming, rather than monumental and intimidating. Visitors reared on television will be more readily drawn to exhibits where information is displayed on TV screens than on printed labels, and video-computer hookups will be used to allow museumgoers to request additional information that is specifically suited to their interests. Because visitors will be able to control the information, museums will be able to present several interpretations of an exhibit or object, permitting the viewer to come to his or her own conclusions. Science museums, maritime museums and museums of human civilization have been among the first to make use of theme park techniques. At <ORGANIZATION> Barcelona </ORGANIZATION>'s Maritime Museum, housed in the 14th century Royal Shipyards building on the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> waterfront, the 180 symposim participants were able to see some of the principles of the modern museum put into practice. For example, the recent remodeling is concentrating on highlighting valuable but poorly lighted exhibits such as the life-size replica of the <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s flagship in the 1517 Battle of <ORGANIZATION> Lepanto </ORGANIZATION>, with halogen focus lamps or fluorescent strip lighting that draws the visitor closer to the objects. The three-year-old City of Science and Industry in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>' <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Villette </ORGANIZATION> neighborhood was billed by its president <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Lesgards </PERSON> as a `` cultural enterprise'' offering the visitor the opportunity to simulate flying an <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> jet, watch a living fetus as it develops or climb inside the Ariane rocket. If this fails to hold one's interest, the visitor can stroll the 136 acres of park surrounding the museum, visit one of the four bars or three shops, change money at the bank, play the discovery-through-play Inventorium for children or do some research with 190,000 reference works. But directors and curators of fine and decorative arts museums have been slower to welcome the Disney-like atmosphere into their marble halls. `` Art museums still contrive to make visitors feel that they are studying for an examination or should be,'' said <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>, who is no friend of theme parks. He believes the museum of the future will have to become a grassroots social center where the atmosphere surrounding the objects may be more important than the objects themselves. In <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>'s view, the art museum of the future will have to pay more attention to creating a context for the art and to revealing the codes of meaning contained in the work of many artists, especially contemporary ones. `` One of the most effective ways of doing that is to have presentations that look through the eyes of the artist,'' he said. <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Samper </PERSON>, senior director of government and media relations for <LOCATION> Colonial </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Williamsburg </LOCATION>, said most museum people resent the theme park as an interloper. `` For them, the real thing is the real thing,'' he said. `` But like detente, it -LRB- the theme park -RRB- must be recognized. We must adapt our activities to make the best of our assets while keeping up with the competition.''

<TEXT>
 In the late 1970s, <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Summer </PERSON> ruled as Disco Queen of the music world. But she turned in her tiara once breakdancing out-hustled the hustle. Summer made headlines in 1980 by signing with the newly-formed <PERSON> Geffen </PERSON> record label, whose founder, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Geffen </PERSON>, had successfully promoted <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> <PERSON> Browne </PERSON>, the Eagles and <PERSON> Joni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>. It seemed like a perfect match. Summer was coming off a phenomenal string of hit singles, including `` Bad Girls,'' `` On the Radio'' and `` Hot Stuff.'' <PERSON> Geffen </PERSON> was a widely respected executive -LRB- <PERSON> Browne </PERSON> still thanks him on each of his records -RRB- who also signed <PERSON> Elton </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON>, <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON>. But something went wrong. Many of the big names soon became unhappy and left. Summer's first record for <PERSON> Geffen </PERSON>, `` The Wanderer,'' went gold, but her sales later fell off. By the mid -'80s, she was seeking her release from the `` It was n't working,'' she recalled in a recent interview. `` It was n't that we hated each other, it just was n't working. They did n't really have the facilities to promote someone like me It was frustrating.'' Her major success of the decade came in 1983 with the album, `` She Works Hard for the Money.'' The title track was a Top 10 smash, an anthem for working women. `` Unconditional Love,'' a collaboration with the reggae group <ORGANIZATION> Musical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION>, was also a major hit. The record came out on <ORGANIZATION> Polygram </ORGANIZATION>. Summer had flops as well, `` Cats Without Claws,'' and `` All Systems Go''; when she completed work on `` Another Place and Time,'' <PERSON> Geffen </PERSON> refused to release it. `` <PERSON> David </PERSON> said he did n't like the album. He said he was n't going to put it out and I could sue him if I wanted to,'' she said. `` I thought, ` Oh, great, then I'll go. This is the chance I've been waiting for, I do n't want to be here.''' She signed with <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION>, and `` This Time I Know It's for Real,'' the debut single, soon reached the Top 10. The album, recorded in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, was produced and written by the team of <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Stock </PERSON>, <PERSON> Matt </PERSON> <PERSON> Aitken </PERSON> and <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Waterman </PERSON>, who have also worked with <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Astley </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Bananarama </LOCATION>. `` The guys who produced me are very commercial minded, much more than I am,'' she said. `` As an artist and a writer you tend to want to do what you want to do. There's a time you need to be commercial, that's the whole object: to sell records, enough to be on a label. You need somebody to kind of monitor your sense of creativity.'' Summer usually contributes her own material, but admitted to getting sidetracked by more `` creative'' pursuits. `` I got very involved in seeing polo played. One of my best friends, her husband is captain of Prince <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>' polo team. `` I had to go,'' she said with a laugh. `` I could n't say no. You do n't get these chances all the time in life. Every week we went up there for about two days. I had such a ball, and I do n't get to take a lot of vacations because of my kids.'' Summer, who was born in 1948 in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, became the soloist in her church choir by age 10. `` There was no question I would be a singer, I just always knew. I had credit in my neighborhood, people would lend me money and tell me to pay it back when I got famous.'' She began cashing in with `` Love to Love You Baby,'' a No. 1 hit in 1975 that helped open the disco era. For the next four years, she was everywhere. Eight singles in the Top 10, three reaching No. 1, and three consecutive chart-topping double albums: `` Live and More,'' `` Bad Girls'' and `` On the Radio, Greatest Hits I and II.'' But Summer was never comfortable with the `` Disco Queen'' label. Musically, she began to change in 1979 with `` Hot Stuff,'' which had a tough, rock' n' roll beat. `` I grew up on rock' n' roll,'' said Summer, who later covered a <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Springsteen </PERSON> song, `` Protection.'' `` I like the <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Blues </ORGANIZATION>, the Beatles and the <ORGANIZATION> Rolling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stones </ORGANIZATION> as well as <PERSON> Aretha </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dionne </PERSON> <PERSON> Warwick </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Supremes </ORGANIZATION> and Temptations. I did n't know many white kids who did n't know the <ORGANIZATION> Supremes </ORGANIZATION>; I do n't know many black kids who do n't know the <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Blues </ORGANIZATION>.'' And who would have guessed that the voice behind so many dance floor hits secretly longed for a house in the country? `` When I was a kid, I studied agriculture,'' said Summer, who lives with her husband, <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Sudano </PERSON>, and three daughters on a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> farm. `` I wanted to do agriculture. I always had a sense of wanting to live on a farm, just being free to walk and have no people around. I wanted to have a space where I did n't have to be anything for anybody.'' Summer is anxious to attract a young audience, but concedes that today's kids would rather dance to <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON>. So what happened to the kids who danced to `` Bad Girls'' in 1979? `` They're having kids,'' <PERSON> Summer </PERSON> said, `` and I'm going to hope their kids are buying records.''

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Bill Anderson Swears Off Songs Glorifying Drinking</HEAD>

 Veteran TV and country music entertainer <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, whose wife was almost killed in a traffic accident, says he will never again perform songs about alcoholic beverages. <PERSON> Becky </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 43, suffered brain damage and was given just a 50-50 chance to live after her car was struck head on by a truck driven by a drunken driver in 1984. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> recounts the incident, and several other personal setbacks, in his new autobiography `` Whisperin' Bill.'' The book, published by <ORGANIZATION> Longstreet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, takes its title from <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s nickname. The 461-page book marks another career milestone for <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, who has been a Grand Ole Opry singer, award-winning songwriter, soap opera actor, network game show host, record producer and businessman. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said his wife's accident, from which she has almost fully recovered, has made him realize the danger of drinking and driving. He's sworn off performing songs about drinking, tunes that are a mainstay of country music. `` This has really opened up my eyes to the fact it is very real,'' he said. `` I do n't think before this happened that I was as sensitive to it as I am now. Before, I thought it was just something you sang about and you kind of lived your life as you wanted to. `` Now, I will not sing a drinking song.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Andersons </ORGANIZATION> filed a $ 4 million civil lawsuit after the accident. A <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> jury awarded them $ 1.2 million, but a judge reduced the award to $ 825,000. At the time, the $ 1.2 million was the largest amount ever awarded in <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>. `` The whole thing that happened to her was so senseless,'' the 51-year-old <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said in an interview. `` It did n't have to happen, yet it did. I ca n't blame it on anything other than the fact he -LRB- the other driver, celebrating his 18th birthday -RRB- was drunk.'' The accident happened after <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> had enjoyed one of the most successful and diverse careers among <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> entertainers. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> had been co-host of the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> game show `` The Better Sex,'' had appeared periodically for three years on the soap opera `` One Life to Live'' and also acted in television's `` <PERSON> Alias </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>'' and `` The Men.'' He appeared frequently on other TV game shows such as `` Hollywood Squares'' and `` The Match Game.'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> had recorded more than 40 country music albums and won more than 50 awards for song writing. He had appeared regularly on the Grand Ole Opry since 1961. But the accident was n't the only tragedy faced by the <ORGANIZATION> Andersons </ORGANIZATION>. Daughter <PERSON> Terri </PERSON>, now 28, was diagnosed as having cancer, he lost millions as an investor in a restaurant chain and his own health declined because of a debilitating back problem that kept him on pain medication for months. `` These things kept happening and you wake up every day and hope the last straw is on the camel's back and nothing else will happen,'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said. Finally, life is looking up again. The accident and recovery strengthened his strained marriage. The restaurant chain is on the rebound and doctors are optimistic that the cancer in <LOCATION> Terri </LOCATION> was caught in time. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, whose best known songs are `` Still'' and `` City Lights,'' said writing the book was therapeutic. `` When everything came down as hard and fast as it did, I had so much built up it just had to come out,'' he said. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said the adversity `` made me realize how blessed I had been all my life, that I really had lived a charmed life up until then. It made me thankful and more grateful for that. You take things like good health for granted. `` I think the biggest effect overall was in my priorities,'' he said. `` Things that I thought were important were not and things I did n't think were important were more important than I had ever realized, such as my family. `` I had put career ahead of family at times, but I do n't think I'll do that any more. `` I learned about determination, especially from watching what <PERSON> Becky </PERSON> did -LRB- during recovery -RRB-. There never has been a human being more determined.'' In writing the book, he learned quickly that it's more work than composing a song. `` You write a song and you write one page and you're finished. With a book, you're just getting started.'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said he got some good advice from fellow Grand Ole Opry star <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, who also recently wrote an autobiography. `` She said when you mention frying the onions, you have got to make them smell the onions.''

<BYLINE>At the Movies: ``Do the Right Thing'' ^By DOLORES BARCLAY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Arts Editor</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 When <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> released `` She's Got ta Have It,'' about a sexually independent young woman, <PERSON> Spike </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> was lionized as the leader of a new wave of independent filmmaking. He had made the 1986 lusty black-and-white movie for an amazing $ 175,000. He spent millions more for `` Do the Right Thing,'' and with this frank, realistic and brutal portrait of racism and its byproducts, the brash young filmmaker has entered the mainstream. Race was not an issue in `` She's Got ta Have It.'' In his last film, `` School Daze,'' <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION>' biggest grosser for 1988, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> was strident and polemical in his treatment of racial issues. But in `` Do the Right Thing,'' he allows the movie itself to unravel and define bigotry. The theme for the movie's title comes from a speech made by the late black activist <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> X </PERSON> in December 1964: `` Racism is a human problem and a crime that is absolutely so ghastly that a person who is fighting racism is well within his rights to fight against it by any means necessary until it is eliminated.'' <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> X </PERSON>, and the late Nobelist <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, both play an indirect role in the movie, which takes place in a lower-middle-class neighborhood in the <LOCATION> Bedford-Stuyvesant </LOCATION> section of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>. It is a longing to include photographs of the late civil rights leaders on a `` wall of fame'' in a pizza parlor run by an Italian that sparks a tragic racial confrontation. The Italian owner has only the pictures of white Italian-Americans on his wall, such as <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sophia </PERSON> <PERSON> Loren </PERSON>. It is a sweltering summer in <LOCATION> Bedford-Stuyvesant </LOCATION>. Perspiration runs freely, as do fire hydrants and tempers. <PERSON> Sal </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Aiello </PERSON> -RRB- and his two sons, <PERSON> Vito </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pino </PERSON>, open their pizzeria to start a new day. Da Mayor -LRB- <PERSON> Ossie </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> -RRB-, an ancient resident who spends his time washing down the yesteryears with a bottle of beer, sweeps up; <PERSON> Mookie </PERSON> -LRB- Lee -RRB- arrives in <LOCATION> Dodgers </LOCATION> shirt -LRB- they were once the <ORGANIZATION> Brooklyn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dodgers </ORGANIZATION>, folks -RRB- ready to do his delivery chores. On the street, <PERSON> Radio </PERSON> <PERSON> Raheem </PERSON>, a young man of few words and an intense scowl, lumbers about with a ghetto blaster the size of a minitruck forcing the world to listen to rap music. The stuttering <PERSON> Smiley </PERSON> lopes about trying to sell pictures of King and <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> X. </PERSON> <PERSON> Buggin </PERSON> <PERSON> Out </PERSON>, the local activist, grouses about how there are no blacks on the `` wall of fame,'' and yet only blacks and Hispanics frequent the pizza parlor. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s neighborhood mosaic slowly takes shape with sharp images of human character. Tensions and conflicts abound: <PERSON> Mookie </PERSON> and the young woman who gave birth to his son; <PERSON> Radio </PERSON> <PERSON> Raheem </PERSON> and the Hispanic kids; Radio <PERSON> Raheem </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sal </PERSON>; Buggin Out and <PERSON> Sal </PERSON>; <PERSON> Sal </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pino </PERSON>; <PERSON> Vito </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pino </PERSON>; <PERSON> Mookie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pino </PERSON>. It is the final confrontation between the hothead and racist <PERSON> Pino </PERSON> and <PERSON> Radio </PERSON> <PERSON> Raheem </PERSON> that culminates in the movie's violent end. <PERSON> Raheem </PERSON> is murdered by police; people on the block respond by destroying <PERSON> Sal </PERSON>'s pizzeria. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> does not set up a frenzied, random or mob-inspired reaction. Indeed, it is <PERSON> Mookie </PERSON>, a character who easily talks to everyone and who plays the role of peacekeeper, who casts the first stone. He is, as <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> X </PERSON> advised, doing whatever is necessary to fight racism. As <PERSON> Sal </PERSON>, the Italian who has run a business in a black neighborhood for 25 years, <PERSON> Aiello </PERSON> is splendid. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> is endearing as the downtrodden <PERSON> Da </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayor </PERSON>, and his wife, <PERSON> Ruby </PERSON> <PERSON> Dee </PERSON>, has a wonderful character in <PERSON> Da </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayor </PERSON>'s love interest, Mother Sister. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Torturro </PERSON> does a believable stupid punk as the racist <PERSON> Pino </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> is menacing as <PERSON> Raheem </PERSON>. The movie introduces <PERSON> Rosie </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> in the role of <PERSON> Tina </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mookie </PERSON>'s girlfriend She also does some explosive dancing with the opening titles. However, as an actress, her lines are muddled. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> has created something of a repertory company with his films, and one sees familiar faces in them all. His sister, <PERSON> Joie </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, who co-starred in `` She's Got ta Have It,'' returns as <PERSON> Mookie </PERSON>'s gracious sister, <PERSON> Jade </PERSON>, who is adored by <PERSON> Sal </PERSON>. <PERSON> Giancarlo </PERSON> <PERSON> Esposito </PERSON>, who has co-starred in <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s two major releases, plays Buggin Out. <PERSON> Esposito </PERSON> has found his niche with <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>: In `` She's Got ta Have It,'' he was a nacissistic dandy; in `` School Daze,'' he was a narcissistic fraternity brother; as Buggin Out, he's self-righteous. As for <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, he has never really thought of himself as an actor. Yet, he always puts in a star performance. His direction is tight, and the mood he creates leaves one as hot as the characters on the screen. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> has a powerful movie, whose truths may repel those who continue to deny that racism is indeed woven into the fabric of American life. The 40 Acres and a Mule Filmworks production is rated R.

 They take too many drugs, and sometimes plead for more. They get confused, shaky and sick, and feel like they're going crazy At least 200,000 end up in hospitals each year. Untold thousands die. Dope-shooting junkies? Hard-core crack cocaine smokers? No _ just folks taking their medicine. `` Most older people are taking too many drugs, and are taking doses that are dangerously high,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON>, director of the Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, founded by consumer advocate <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nader </PERSON>. `` The greatest epidemic of drug abuse in <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> society is among our older people,'' who suffer 9 million adverse reactions to medicine a year, many unrecognized as drug-related, says `` Worst Pills, Best Pills,'' <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON>'s 1988 book on overmedication of older people. Side effects include depression, hallucinations, confusion, memory loss, delirium, impaired thinking, shaking and twitching, nausea, vomiting, appetite loss, stomach pain and bleeding, constipation, diarrhea, difficulty urinating and controlling urination, dizziness, and falls that result in hip fractures. People 60 and older represent 17 percent of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> population but account for nearly 40 percent of drug-related hospitalizations and more than half the deaths from drug reactions, said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kusserow </PERSON>, inspector general of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. Experts say the elderly are prone to harmful reactions or interactions between drugs because they take so many medicines, largely because they have more maladies than younger people. And age can slow the body's ability to process and excrete drugs, making it more likely they will interact or accumulate to toxic levels. Yet the elderly, their relatives and doctors often blame drug-related symptoms on old age, said <PERSON> Kathryn </PERSON> <PERSON> Watterson </PERSON>, author of `` The Safe Medicine Book.'' `` There is n't any reason people should n't expect to feel very good when they get older. If they do n't, there's a reason: either a disease or the medicine they're on. Thousands of elderly Americans die each year from adverse reactions to medications, although the exact toll is unknown, <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kusserow </PERSON> said. In a series of reports last year, the <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> estimated drug reactions kill 73,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senior citizens annually, said reporter <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, now editor of the <LOCATION> Newhall </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> -RRB- Signal. That calculation was based on <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> statistics and other research. `` That could very well be in the right ball park,'' said <PERSON> Kusserow </PERSON>, who calls overmedication of the elderly `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s other drug problem.'' In a report this year, <PERSON> Kusserow </PERSON> estimated that at least 200,000 elderly Americans are hospitalized each year by adverse drug reactions. `` We suspect the number is considerably larger'' because many hospitalizations are wrongly blamed on patients' diseases rather than their medicines, he said. The Republic estimated 1.9 million such hospitalizations yearly. The <ORGANIZATION> Pharmaceutical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> lacks data on drug-related deaths and hospitalization. If the Republic's estimates are correct, such cases still represent much less than 1 percent of prescriptions written annually for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s elderly, said spokesman <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Trewhitt </PERSON>. The problem `` is not totally out of hand as is being implied,'' he said. <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON>, however, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senior citizens fill 613 million prescriptions annually, an average of 15.5 per person, and many `` are taking ... as many as 10 different drugs at a time.'' He contends at least two-thirds of those prescriptions fall into one of three categories: the dose is excessive; a safer alternative should have been used; or the prescription is unnecessary because the diagnosis is wrong or the disease should be treated by non-drug therapy, such as diet changes. Sleeping pills, tranquilizers and anti-anxiety drugs most commonly cause harmful side effects among the elderly, said Dr. <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> on Aging. Drugs for cardiovascular and digestive ailments also are overused, <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON> said. Elderly patients often have several doctors. To avoid drug misuse, older patients should `` get a brown paper bag, put everything they're taking in it, and go review it with their primary doctor,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. In addition, pharmacists should do a better job monitoring patients' drug use to prevent harmful interactions, <PERSON> Kusserow </PERSON> said. Doctors receive woefully inadequate training in pharmacology and geriatrics, and depend heavily on self-interested drug company advertisements and salespeople for information, he said. Many spend too little time with elderly patients, and `` may not find out what drugs patients are on before giving new drugs,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>, gerontology dean at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>. They also tend to `` use the prescription pad as the way to terminate an appointment with a patient,'' <PERSON> Watterson </PERSON> said. Patients share the blame, though, with more than half of elderly patients failing to follow dosage instructions, <PERSON> Kusserow </PERSON> said. In addition, `` older people can be very persistent,'' demanding drugs and `` shopping around'' until they find a doctor who complies, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. `` I spend a lot of my time trying to talk elderly people out of taking drugs, and they look at me like I'm crazy,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Freedman </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>'s geriatrics director. `` All physicians probably prescribe more than they want to prescribe. There are times when people sort of push you into giving them a prescription.''

 <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> does n't look like a junkie, but for 22 years the unassuming grandfather was hooked on a narcotic painkiller and sleeping pills. `` I've been on so many different kinds of pills you'd have to get a book to tell you how many. The more you take the worse off you are. One pill leads to another pill. And I was drinking liquor on top of that.'' `` It's a wonder he's alive today,'' said <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Benton </PERSON>, 81, married for nearly 60 years to the retired clothing factory production manager. `` You know what living in hell is? Watching somebody go through this.'' For <PERSON> Benton </PERSON>, 86, recovery started early last year when he felt ill, sleepless, confused and like `` my mind was n't acting properly.'' He quit cigarettes, most medicines and, finally, the two hefty shots of whiskey he enjoyed nightly. Last fall he spent two agonizing months withdrawing from his 22-year habit of three to seven daily Percodans, a painkiller containing a synthetic narcotic. `` He was a Percodan junkie,'' said <PERSON> Benton </PERSON>'s son-in-law, <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON> Sol </PERSON> <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON>, but he quit Percodan `` at home without any help.'' A doctor first prescribed Percodan in 1966, when <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> suffered severe stress headaches. Over the years, he mixed Percodan with Feldene and Indocin, arthritis drugs; Orinase, for diabetes; antacids; decongestants; Motrin, a non-narcotic painkiller; Coumadin, to prevent blood clots that caused leg pains; Elavil, an antidepressant; and Xanax, Ativan, <LOCATION> Librium </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Serax </PERSON> to fight sleeplessness, anxiety and nervousness. The situation worsened several years ago when a car rear-ended <PERSON> Benton </PERSON>'s, injuring his neck and prompting another doctor to prescribe more Percodan. `` Doctors keep giving you the stuff. You just tell them, ` My head bothers me, my neck bothers me, I ca n't sleep.' They'll give you pills.'' If any doctor objected, <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> would say, `` Doc, if you take me off it, you'll hurt me more than if you leave me on it. `` The minute it wears off you get a terrible urge. Everything begins to disturb you. You crave it. I could n't go to sleep without it. I could n't do anything without it.'' <PERSON> Benton </PERSON>'s daughter, <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON>, said his latest doctor kept urging him to quit Percodan, but was compassionate enough not to cut off his supply. `` <PERSON> Gramp </PERSON> was desperately, profoundly dependent on his various doctors to keep him in <LOCATION> Percodan </LOCATION>. He lived in fear of someone cutting him off. It would be easy to condemn all the doctors involved, but I can see their position too.'' `` I do n't want to blame my doctor. I was the one who coaxed him,'' said <PERSON> Benton </PERSON>, who finally decided to quit most medications and then Percodan because of sleeplessness, weakness, drug-induced hives and mental confusion. As <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> tapered off Percodan, `` I was weak, sweaty, nauseous, had an inner craving. My mind would n't relax. I was hot and cold all the time.'' He also suffered severe insomnia. He now takes only coated aspirin for arthritis and, occasionally, one-quarter of a sleeping pill. `` My mind is now alert,'' he said. He sleeps and feels better, and is starting to regain the motivation he believes the drugs robbed him of. And he wants other senior citizens to know the dangers of overmedication: `` It wrecks your body and your mind. It's going to ruin your life.''

<HEAD>Consumer Group's Rules For Safer Drug Use By The Elderly</HEAD>
<HEAD>With BC-PRI--Old and Drugged</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Here are 10 rules for safer drug use adapted from `` Worst Pills, Best Pills: The Older Adult's Guide to Avoiding Drug-Induced Death or Illness,'' by Dr. <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON> and others at the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. -LRB- 1 -RRB- Have `` brown bag sessions'' with your primary doctor. When you go to a doctor you have n't seen before or with whom you have never had such a session, dump into a bag all prescription and over-the-counter drugs you are using, have used in the last month or are likely to use, and take them along. Discuss the reason each was prescribed, the dose and frequency, how long you should take it, possible side effects, possible interactions with foods or other drugs, and whether you can stop taking any of them. -LRB- 2 -RRB- Contact your doctor if you have any of the following symptoms after starting a drug: depression, hallucinations, confusion, delirium, memory loss, impaired thinking, shaking or twitching, dizziness upon standing, falls, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, bleeding, constipation, diarrhea, difficulty urinating and loss of bladder control. -LRB- 3 -RRB- `` Assume that any new symptom you develop after starting a new drug might be caused by the drug.'' Report it to your doctor. -LRB- 4 -RRB- Make sure you really need the drug for your condition and ask whether the side effects may be worse than the disease. -LRB- 5 -RRB- `` If drug therapy is indicated, in most cases it is safer to start with a dose that is lower than the usual adult dose.'' -LRB- 6 -RRB- When adding a drug, see if it is possible to stop another drug. -LRB- 7 -RRB- Review with your doctor at least every three to six months the need to keep taking each drug. -LRB- 8 -RRB- Before leaving the doctor's office or pharmacy, make sure you and a family member or friend understand the instructions for taking the medication. -LRB- 9 -RRB- `` Discard all old drugs carefully.'' Throw them away when your therapy is over so you are n't tempted to use or give away outdated drugs. -LRB- 10 -RRB- `` Ask your primary doctor to coordinate your care and drugs. If you see a specialist and he or she wants to start you on new medicines in addition to the ones you are on, check with your primary doctor first.''

 When next year's head count is done <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> officials expect to report there are more people aged 65 and over than there were Americans at the time of the Civil War. The 1860 Census found 31.4 million Americans. The 1990 count is expected to find 31.6 million people 65 and older, 13.2 million of those being 75 and older. The 1830 Census counted 12.9 million people. `` There is no historical precedent for the aging of our population. We are in the midst of a new social phenomenon,'' wrote <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Soldo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Emily </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Agree </PERSON> in `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Elderly,'' a study for the private <ORGANIZATION> Population </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>. `` We can not foresee all the repercussions, implications, or social changes stemming from the presence of so many older persons and the aging of society.'' People born in 1900 could expect to live 47 years. Life expectancy passed 50 in 1908, topped 60 in the 1930s and hit 70 in the'60s. Americans born today can expect to live about 75 years, thanks largely to better medical care. The elderly comprise about 12.2 percent of the population. Well over half are women, 70 percent say they're healthy and three-fourths own their homes. They also spend a greater percentage of what are often fixed incomes on food, housing and health care than younger people. But take a closer look. By definition the elderly are 65 and up, but the mix is changing. In 1960, 6.1 percent of the population was 65 to 74 and 3.1 percent was 75 and older. By 1987, 7.2 percent were 65 to 74 and 5 percent were 75 or older. A half-century ago, men and women comprised equal numbers of the elderly, but women began living longer in the 1930s as pregnancy-and childbirth-related deaths began declining. Women now live an average 78.3 years, compared with 71.5 years for men, and comprise 59.2 percent of those age 65 and over. As of 1988, 10.3 percent of all <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> males were 65 or older, compared with 14.3 percent of all women. `` The problems of old age in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> are largely the problems of women. Six out of every 10 older Americans are women,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>, a former director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> on Aging. `` In general, older women have fewer financial assets and, because they typically outlive their spouses, are more dependent on adult children and formal health care services,'' Agree and <PERSON> Soldo </PERSON> wrote. And that poses a problem, with the need for home care for many elderly rising just as social change threatens to undermine the traditional source of that care, says researcher Alice T. Day. In a 1985 <ORGANIZATION> Population </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> report, she estimated 6.6 million elderly people needed long-term care but only 1.4 million were in nursing homes. The rest were helped by families. But small families mean fewer young people to care for the elderly and most of them face other obligations, including jobs. While elderly women tend to be widows, 80 percent of men aged 65 to 74 are married, as are 66 percent of those aged 75 and over. As people age, health is of increasing concern. `` Four out of every five noninstitutionalized older persons have at least one chronic condition and many have more than one,'' said <PERSON> Soldo </PERSON> and Agree. `` The most common of these diseases are arthritis, hypertension, heart disease and hearing impairments.'' The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> reported in 1984 that 23 percent of the elderly had trouble completing at least one common task like shopping, preparing meals and housework. Nevertheless, a survey by the center found that 70 percent of elderly considered themselves to be in good or excellent health. Those with higher incomes were more likely to list themselves in excellent health. Since most elderly people are retired, they have lower average incomes. In 1986, median income for families headed by someone 65 and older was $ 19,932, about 62 percent of that for families headed by someone 25 to 64. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Special </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Aging in 1985 reported a median income of $ 20,354 for families with a 65 - to 74-year-old head, $ 16,412 for those headed by 75 - to 84-year-olds, and $ 15,111 for 85 and With less cash, the elderly tend to spend a bigger percentage of it on food, housing and health care than do younger people. Even so, business now views the elderly as a market segment of growing importance, and has begun targeting products and advertising. Another place where the elderly have attracted attention is the voting booth. More than one in five voters in the 1986 congressional elections was 65 and over. While 46 percent of all eligible voters went to the polls, 65.1 percent of those 65 to 74 voted, the most of any population segment. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee found that most older people are adequately housed, although some have problems finding affordable homes. In 1985, three-fourths of elder households owned their home and 25 percent rented. Males were more likely to own than were females, and those over age 75 were more likely to rent. The elderly tended to occupy older homes, 36 percent living in house built before 1940, compared to 21 percent of younger people. The 1983 Annual Housing Survey found 10 percent of the homes occupied by the elderly with some serious flaw in such areas as plumbing, electrical, structure and heating.

 When <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Rheinhart </PERSON> needed to expand his office recently, he did n't have to look far for expertise. The architect and skilled craftspeople he needed all were on his payroll _ and they all were retired. So are the office workers at <ORGANIZATION> Rheinhart </ORGANIZATION>'s 11-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Retiree </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Skills </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a temporary-help agency handling people over age 50. Ads on buses, cabs and elsewhere say it offers employers `` Experience! Skills! Dependability!'' `` I do n't care how many age discrimination laws there are, age is the main reason people over 50 are n't hired when they seek work,'' says <PERSON> Rheinhart </PERSON>, a 68-year-old retired stockbroker. `` We do n't guarantee we'll get anyone a job, but on the other hand we do n't charge them anything either <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Shine </PERSON> and <PERSON> Roscoe </PERSON> <PERSON> Lacy </PERSON>, both 70, have been with Retiree Skills almost from its start 11 years ago. `` I'd be lost without something productive to do, and with the cost of living what it is the money do n't hurt anything either,'' says <PERSON> Shine </PERSON>, who ran his own sporting goods store for years. Now he paints houses, limits his work week to 24 hours and will continue `` as long as I can climb a ladder.'' <PERSON> Lacy </PERSON>, who spent 30 years in the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, averages 24 hours a week, filling in for school custodians who are sick or on vacation. `` I'll do it as long as I can get around When you're active it keeps you young.'' Retiree Skills offers workers in more than 200 job classifications, including secretaries, engineers, accountants, electricians, word processors, chemists, plumbers, carpenters, mail-room personnel, equipment operators, masons, computer programmers, auditors and laborers. `` There's even a professional clown,'' <PERSON> Rheinhart </PERSON> says. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> on Aging says it knows of no similar group. Most temporary-help agencies specialize in categories like office workers; most employment organizations for retirees are limited to one type of professional. Workers remain on the payroll of Retiree Skills, saving the temporary employer <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION>, sick pay, retirement, vacation and insurance costs, which can total a third or more of the average payroll. Employers are billed for actual time at a rate above what workers are paid, which <PERSON> Rheinhart </PERSON> says is near the area's prevailing wage for their skill. The minimum is $ 4 an hour. More than 300 companies have used Retiree Skills and <PERSON> Rheinhart </PERSON> says he has found work for more than 2,500 people. About 800 now are registered. `` Most came to us originally as a last resort. Can you believe the morale boost for someone who's almost at the point of feeling useless and then finding he's got talent that people are looking for and are willing to pay for? And the flip side is that the people who use them are getting genuine bargains. Aside from their skills, their old-fashioned work ethic is so different from what's fashionable today among younger people,'' <PERSON> Rheinhart </PERSON> says `` I have a very positive reaction to Retiree Skills,'' says <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, office manager for <ORGANIZATION> Desert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Analytics </ORGANIZATION>, a small testing laboratory. <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Koenig </PERSON>, a retired chemical engineer, did so well as a temporary lab technician that he was hired as a regular, `` working somewhat less than 40 hours a week because he wants Mondays off,'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> says. Another worker, a 58-year-old banker forced out in a corporate realignment, was sent to a savings and loan and stayed eight years. He had applied for work at 60 places, <PERSON> Rheinhart </PERSON> says, including the one that finally kept him on. Retiree Skills keeps people on Social Security advised about how much they may earn without penalties. Those 65 to 70 can make $ 8,800 this year and still receive all benefits. Under 65, it's $ 6,480. Generally, $ 1 in benefits is lost for each $ 2 earned over the limit. At 70, full benefits are available regardless of earnings. <PERSON> Rheinhart </PERSON>, who had started a life insurance company in <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, and a brokerage in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, retired to <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION> to play golf. `` But you can play just so much golf without getting bored. Most of the people I met were older and I was hearing two things from them _ they either did n't have enough to do, or, if they did have things to do, they did n't have enough money to do them. `` About that time the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> on Aging put on a TV commercial that showed an empty rocking chair that was in motion, with the suggestion it was time for the elderly to get off their rocker. `` Those two things gave me the idea to start Retiree Skills.'' He hopes eventually to franchise the Retiree Skill idea and has trademarked its slogan: `` From Inactivity to Productivity.''

 <PERSON> Marjory </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoneman </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> stands watch over the <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION> with the temperament of the ancient sawgrass that dominates the wetland. She can be smooth and genteel, hands folded in her lap and voice hinting at the refinement of her <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> upbringing more than three generations ago. Yet, like the sawgrass, she cuts for the bone when rubbed the wrong way. `` It's not a question of if we can save the <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION>. We must,'' said <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>, 99. `` There is no choice to consider. Without the <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION>, much of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> is lost, too.'' Water is the gift of the <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION>, a soggy plain that ends a 300-mile water system running down the center of the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> peninsula. This slow-moving `` River of Grass'' _ part of the title of <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>' 1947 book _ starts a process that brings rain to the populated coast during the six-month wet season. `` Whether you're a developer or an environmentalist, the message is still the same,'' <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> said. `` If the <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION> go, then <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> becomes a desert.'' The greatest threat is n't pollution, but the draining of land to accommodate the boom in one of the fastest growing states. `` I'd say about 80 percent of the <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION> are unspoiled. But what I'm most worried about is man's ignorance of the importance of the <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION>. The people coming to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> know nothing about the <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION>. That is our greatest peril.'' Age has clouded <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>' sight. But her vision is reaching new horizons. Recent attention to the <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION> has brought renewed attention to her crusade. In January, she and five other women were named Ms. magazine's women of the year; she was <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>' person of the week Jan. 13, and was on the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> `` Today'' show in February. In May, she became an honorary vice president of the national <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, the highest award the organization gives. But she was conspicuously absent from a three-day conference in January on the <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION>, which featured more than 200 experts and officials. She prefers to surrender the high-profile events to the Friends of the <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION>, a group she founded in the 1960s. She'd rather greet visitors in the stucco cottage that she built in 1926 in Coconut Grove From her easy chair surrounded by cassette tapes of books, she receives word on the political battles being waged over the <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION>. `` Why do people worry about me and my age so much?'' said <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>, who disdains ambiguity. `` I get by. Let's concentrate on the real problems.'' `` She has been to the <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION> what <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON> was to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in World War II,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Finley </PERSON>, the park's superintendent `` She has been the leader, the conscience, the rallying point.'' Throughout her life, <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> has kept a distant relationship with the <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION>. Even when her sight was good, she rarely traveled into the grass and cypress interior. Besides, she says, there are too many bugs. `` Every time it rains, we know the <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION> are there,'' said <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>, who dons a floppy wide-brimmed hat whenever outdoors. `` It's not necessary to be out there to feel its presence.'' `` I suppose you could say the <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION> and I have the kind of friendship that does n't depend on constant physical contact,'' she wrote in `` River of Grass,'' the product of five years' research. In 1915, <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> left a domineering husband in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and boarded a southbound train. Her destination was literally the end of the line. <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> was then a ramshackle railway terminus of 5,000 residents where ice was scarce and dreams of riches in real estate abounded. It was also home to her father, a lawyer who founded what would become The <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> newspaper with a printing press he collected on a bad debt. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> landed a job as a columnist and reporter, but soon left to sell free-lance magazine articles. In 1943, she began a novel to help overcome an emotional breakdown following her father's death. When a publisher asked for a book on the tiny <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, she felt it too insignificant. She persuaded the publisher to consider a treatise on the <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION> water system. Nearly 50 years later, the book is still in print. Among her other eight books are `` <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>: The Long Frontier'' in 1967 and `` Alligator Crossing,'' a children's book. She can no longer use a typewriter, but is determined to dictate a biography of English environmentalist W.H. <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>, best known for his book `` Green Mansions.'' Death, in <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>' view, is the end. She believes in no afterlife for herself or for south <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> if the <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION> perish. `` When -LRB- the <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION> -RRB- are gone, then we are finished. There's not much to consider beyond that.''

 A person born during the year 1900 could expect to live to be 50 years old. Today, a person's life expectancy at birth is 75 years, a full generation longer. Why are people living longer? What do these extra years mean to the individual, to the family, to society? How long a person lives depends on several factors: genetics, medical advances, lifestyle, and environmental assaults. Science and medicine have given us antibiotics, vaccines and better medical care so that illnesses once fatal no longer are. People are more aware than ever of changes in lifestyle that affect health: eating a well-balanced diet that limits fats and fiber, exercising sensibly, wearing seat belts, quitting smoking, and drinking little, if any, alcohol, have all contributed to longer, healthier lives. Governmental regulations have eliminated many concerns about the food we eat, the water we drink and the air we breathe. Some 20 or 30 years ago, people believed that getting old meant an inevitable decline of health and intellectual function. In fact, many medical textbooks still use the word `` senile'' to describe people who suffer confusion and memory loss and imply that this condition is a natural consequence of age. Today, thanks to studies on normal human aging, we know that people can live to be 100 and more with no evidence of heart disease or memory impairment. Scientists also have concluded that personality does not change with age. In fact, there are few, if any, changes that occur to all people as they grow old. Despite these results, there are many people for whom aging is no joy. I recently met a woman in her mid-70s who confided, `` No one ever told me that growing old hurts so much.'' Many older people become dependent on family members and society because of debilitating conditions that severely restrict their independence. Arthritis, osteoporosis and Alzheimer's disease, to name a few, are problems for which science and society have not yet found adequate solutions. A person should be able to remain functional and vigorous throughout life. As director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> on Aging at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, I am all too frequently asked, `` Is this what I have to look forward to as I grow old?'' Studies that help us to understand and eliminate the afflictions that rob a person of independence are a high priority among researchers around the world. Make no mistake, we have made progress. For example, we have the expertise to treat certain forms of urinary incontinence, we have identified the risk factors that make falls and subsequent fractures likely, and we understand the benefits of early rehabilitation after stroke. Because of these and other successes, many children today know their grandparents, and even their great grandparents. In many cases, grandparents are an integral part of the family and are called upon to lend support to the family unit. This is all very positive. However, new problems arise as many grown children are called upon to care for a frail parent or relative. For many, the caregiving role is fraught with doubts, guilt, tedium and fears, and indeed is an area which requires innovative approaches to best serve all concerned. To society, the implications of the growing number of older people is still confusing. Many healthy older people do not choose retirement. They wish to remain employed. Health-care systems do not yet know how to respond to the growing number of people who require long-term care. Health professionals and policymakers need to sort out the ramifications of having so many older people in need of assistance. From the day you are born you begin to age. No matter how old you are, aging issues apply. I hope this information will serve to eliminate some of the common fears many of us have about growing old.

 My garden looks tidier and yields richer harvests today than the vegetable patch I was cultivating eight years ago when, at age 65, I drew my first pension check. Leisure has worked wonders. New retirees planning to raise vegetables will enter an exciting era. The kitchen garden, reflecting our widely traveled population, has acquired a global look, with European and oriental favorites now maturing next to the old corn patch. Midget vegetables and intensive growing techniques have come along for people with small gardens. Also, power tillers as light as 17 pounds, a boon for seniors. To meet demand, new seed houses have sprung up dealing primarily in exotic fare. Old established catalogs have added international sections. If you liked a crisp lettuce you savored in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, a red radicchio chicory in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> or a bok-choi cabbage in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, you can find the seeds here. Meanwhile, domestic breeders multiplied their own offerings. All told, up to 130 new cultivars, from beans to zucchini, appeared in this year's catalogs. Why grow your own when the world's choicest produce adorns supermarket shelves? Well, anyone who has nurtured a bean or tomato from babyhood knows no store-bought veggie matches the taste of the home garden's fresh young crops. Legions of us share that feeling. A Gallup survey for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gardening </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> shows 31 million <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> households grew vegetables in 1988. Some garden organically, avoiding pesticides. For my 70th birthday, my wife, children and grandchildren bought me a new fence to replace the unsightly sagging wire and rotting locust poles. With a post-hole digger and grunts of strength, my son put in pressure-treated poles to resist the weather. Above the taut new chicken wire we strung a battery-operated `` hot'' wire to keep out woodchuck and raccoon. Along with the facelift, I set out to deepen the scattered know-how I had accumulated in 30 years of gardening. Enrolling in a college horticulture course, I met numerous other seniors with the same intention, among them a 75-year-old whose children had given him a greenhouse for his birthday. We got valuable tips and sobering insights into the magnitude of the subject from professors discussing soil, water, sun and plants in terms of complex chemical equations. Seniors wanting a less formal approach will find wide coverage of gardening in books, magazines and newspapers, the best advice often coming from the local columnist, who knows the peculiarities of the area. Television, radio and videocassettes cover the field. Computer owners can buy software that will design gardens, plan crops according to geographical location, give tips on fertilizers, estimate costs and keep records. On my own, I dug into the often-hard-to-find history and legends of the vegetables I was raising, putting together a modest little bookshelf of intriguing lore. And, smoothly helped along by my word processor, I streamlined and greatly expanded my day-to-day notes on the progress of the season. As time went on, gardening became more and more a year-round activity for me. Indoors, under lights, I'm always growing something. In the winter, I raise lettuce, arugula, parsley, basil, chives and some small tomatoes in a custom-made fluorescent stand in the dining room. The same stand serves to start the seeds for most of my outdoor summer crops, giving me a jump on the season. We live in the country, 50 miles north of <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, with plenty of room in my 65-by-25-foot garden for space-gobblers like corn and asparagus. But in sharply dwindled space I could still produce quantity and variety for just me and my wife. Nationwide, gardens keep getting smaller; a Gallup survey shows the typical plot dropped in 1988 to only 200 square feet. But along with the drop have come miniature vegetables and techniques for utilizing space to the utmost. Tomato plants no taller than a foot are producing small fruit in four-inch pots. I've found that three or four broccoli plants, two zucchini plants, a few tomato plants and a couple of eggplants fill our two-person needs in these crops. I grow varieties with staggered harvests and also succession crops of beans and lettuce, keeping the garden busy deep into the frosts of autumn. Cold-loving <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> sprouts, still green in the snow, provide us with garden-fresh vegetables for Christmas dinner. From the part-time gardening of my working years I've become a full-time gardener with something of a farmer's priorities. When friends grouse about a rainy forecast I'm thinking the rain is good for my lettuce.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> will `` borrow'' more than $ 51 million this year from state employee retirement funds and tax some pension benefits as part of a plan to eliminate a $ 150 million shortage in a $ 3.2 billion budget. Gov. Rose Mofford opposed using retirement funds but is expect to sign the budget-balancing package. Unions and retirees also opposed it. <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> will reduce its pension contribution for one year, then repay the funds in future years. Another $ 2.2 million would be raised by taxing any pension benefits over $ 2,500 for local, state and federal retirees. Local and state pensions are not now taxed and federal retirees are taxed on anything over $ 2,500. The change was made in part to comply with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s ruling that all government retirees be taxed equally. Lawmakers also halved a school tax for residents of retirement communities that do not have organized school districts.

 The Legislature this year doubled the staff of the ombudsman responsible for 6,000 residents of 38 nursing homes and 617 adult-care homes _ it authorized money for her to hire an assistant. Next year, lawmakers will be asked to tackle a tougher issue, said <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rongitsch </PERSON>, the longterm-care ombudsman.

 Legislation before the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> could affect elderly people who drive a car, fill out a state tax return or face the possibility of physical or financial exploitation.

 The 1989 Legislature revamped the state's guardianship laws, provided more in-home services for the elderly and disabled and set up a system to investigate elder abuse, neglect and exploitation Nineteen measures directly affecting the elderly take effect in July, including legal recognition of living wills. The two-year spending cycle that starts July 1 also puts $ 5.6 million into in-home services. In revamping guardianships of the elderly, lawmakers required courts to appoint an attorney to act essentially as an ombudsman for the individual and to make proceedings accessible and understandable to impaired people, and required reports from guardians.

 The Legislature has approved a bill linking auto insurance discounts for older drivers with a testing program aimed at keeping unsafe drivers older than 55 off the road. Under the bill, the state Division of Motor Vehicles will develop an accident-prevention course to help those people cope with the effects of aging on their driving ability. In addition to brushing up on laws, participants will be taught how to compensate for the loss of some of their physical skills. Insurance companies would be required to offer discounts to drivers who successfully complete the course. Drivers aged 55-70 would have to repeat the course at least every three years to keep the discount; those over 70 would have to repeat it every two years. If signed by the governor, the bill would become effective Jan. 1.

 Civil rights gains will be eroded further if a federal judge approves <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s proposed settlement of a discrimination suit, says a spokesman for a group of disgruntled black workers. The Concerned Black Salaried Employees of <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> has called on the black community, including co-workers, to boycott <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> products until a settlement it believes is more equitable is reached, spokesman <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Quick </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said Sunday. The group also hopes to fill a courtroom with angry workers today, when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Feikens </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> is scheduled to begin two days of hearings on <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s settlement proposal. The employee group spent the weekend rallying support for the boycott it launched Wednesday, Quick said during a telephone interview from his <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> home. He said the group has draw up to 600 people at its meetings. `` We feel that if the settlement is forced down our throats by Judge <PERSON> Feikens </PERSON>, then that will begin a new era of discrimination in this country,'' said Quick, 52, a former <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> salaried worker and plaintiff in the suit. `` We feel our days in court have been just about snuffed out because of the recent <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decisions'' involving racial issues including reverse discrimination, he said. `` Passive resistance is the approach that we must now seriously consider to make fair hiring practices a real part of good business practice in general,'' Quick said. The suit, filed in 1983 by four black salaried <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> employees, was certified for class action in 1986 on behalf of 10,000 such workers in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> has offered to pay cash settlements to some workers and raise the salaries of others. But the automaker does not admit to discriminating against black workers in pay raises and promotions. If accepted, the settlement would amount to $ 20 million to $ 40 million over the next five years for the plaintiffs, their attorneys said. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> also proposes to monitor the pay and promotion of black workers for five years and to assess that information using computer models for comparable white employees. `` We continue to believe that the proposed agreement is a win-win settlement, and we will wait for the court's review'' this week, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Molloy </PERSON> said. But the settlement proposal falls short in several areas, including payment for damages or lost wages, the Concerned Black Salaried Employees said. The <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> plan would make payments only to those workers whose wages were most out of line, rather than compensate all black workers whose salary fell below the norm, the group claims. It also said the company's proposal would be less binding and enforceable than current policies under the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>. Not all of the suit's plaintiffs oppose the <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> proposal. One of the original four workers who filed the suit, the Rev. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Flint </LOCATION>, said he favors the proposed settlement.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Winpisinger </PERSON>, the unapologetic, outspoken, liberal leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union, walked away quietly last week in the middle of his biggest fight. From retirement, however, the labor veteran _ once referred to as the labor movement's last angry man _ will surely be heard from again. His union's strike against <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> was nearing the four-month point as <PERSON> Winpisinger </PERSON>, 62, took leave Friday of the union he had joined 38 years ago as a high school dropout and led as president for the past 12. He was succeeded by <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Kourpias </PERSON>, who had been a union vice president. `` I had hoped very much to have that as a retirement present,'' <PERSON> Winpisinger </PERSON> said last week when asked whether he believed the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> would win their war with <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and parent <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` But the strike continues. And I'll be more than a casually interested observer for the most of the way.'' To <PERSON> Winpisinger </PERSON>, the strike against <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and the bigger battle with <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> is the manifestation of the `` anti-union animus'' of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> years. `` There was n't a single employer in the country that did n't get that message loudly and clearly and tried to emulate it,'' he said. `` And we've had a wave of union-busting and everything else reminiscent of decades long ago.'' But <PERSON> Winpisinger </PERSON> believes the tide is turning, that better days for the labor movement lie ahead _ if its leaders act responsibly. `` When that power comes back, and I view it as inevitable, it has to be used more responsibly than ever before, so as to diffuse the notion that we are a special interest, that we bargain only for ourselves, that organized workers are somehow greedy by definition,'' he said. He believes a new breed of labor leaders is emerging. `` Most of them are younger, tested, battle-hardened and had to live through all this evolution and discomfort afflicted by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> years,'' he said. `` We've profited from that. We learned what we had to do with our backs against the wall.'' His liberal view has prompted some to label him a socialist, and <PERSON> Winpisinger </PERSON>'s criticisms of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> defense buildup often seemed odd coming from the president of a union representing thousands of workers in defense-related industries. He blames the defense buildup for the decline of basic manufacturing and research and development in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and he labels <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> a hypocrite for making rallying cries for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industry to become more competitive. `` Where the hell do you get all the brains to do that when he's already siphoned all of them into the defense complex,'' said <PERSON> Winpisinger </PERSON> His harsh words are not for Republicans alone. The <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, he said, needs to stop trying to imitate Republicans and return instead to its traditional base. `` We have a lot of people who are running around masquerading as Democrats who are pale imitations of the enemy,'' said <PERSON> Winpisinger </PERSON>, who nominated <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> for president at the 1988 Democratic National Convention. Who will emerge as the party's future leader? <PERSON> Winpisinger </PERSON>'s not sure. `` If the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people showed any propensity at all to elect high school dropouts president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> I'd go out and _ given the money _ I'd try it myself,'' he said with a grin, rolling a fat cigar between his fingers. Retirement will take him away from the platform the nearly million-member <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union gave him, but <PERSON> Winpinsinger </PERSON> promises speak out `` when I perceive the need and perceive that someone will listen ... I do n't intend to be invisible.'' He will freely assess others but not himself, refusing to discuss his contribution to the labor movement. Besides, <PERSON> Winpisinger </PERSON> says he has more important things to worry about. `` I have to catch up on 38 years of accumulated tasks,'' he said. `` And find out whether or not me and my wife can live under the same roof on a daily basis or what kind of adjustments I have to make to make that possible.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said today it will keep its 6,000-employee Merchandise Group in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> but move it to a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> suburb. `` We believe this Chicagoland location will serve the best interests of our company and its shareholders for decades to come,'' Chairman <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said in a statement released before a morning news conference. `` We anticipate that the move to the new facility will begin in 2 -LCB- to 3 years,'' he said. The site is in <LOCATION> Hoffman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Estates </LOCATION>, 20 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Last fall, the nation's largest retailer announced a restructuring plan that included selling the 110-story Sears Tower _ the world's tallest building _ and shifting the <ORGANIZATION> Merchandise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> and its 6,000 employees to less costly quarters. The announcement set off a bidding war between <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Sunbelt </ORGANIZATION> states, especially <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> offered an incentive package worth an estimated $ 61 million to lure the <ORGANIZATION> Merchandise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> to a 200-acre site in <LOCATION> Hoffman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Estates </LOCATION>. The newspaper said local tax breaks to <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> will be worth an estimated $ 178 million. `` The total proposal that was worked out is extremely competitive with alternative sites,'' <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said. The Hoffman Estates site is part of an undeveloped 1,300 acres north of the <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tollway </LOCATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> 59. <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> said it had signed a contract to purchase 700 acres along the tollway, including an outdoor music theater, <LOCATION> Poplar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> said the theater will continue operating. The <ORGANIZATION> Hoffman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estates </ORGANIZATION> parcel was selected from about 50 sites in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> area and other states, <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> estimates that building a campus-style facility in <ORGANIZATION> Hoffman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estates </ORGANIZATION> will cost about $ 220 million. The development will eventually generate an estimated $ 11 million a year in property taxes. <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said future commercial development of the site also is planned. The Tribune and the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sun-Times </ORGANIZATION> said the deal was cemented Sunday after talks between Illinois Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>. When the <ORGANIZATION> Merchandise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> move is completed, about 600 employees of <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> corporate staff will remain in the downtown <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION>, the company said.

<HEAD>Corn, Soybean Futures Slide On Wet Outlook</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Corn and soybean futures prices were sharply lower in early trading today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> following reports of heavy rains Sunday on the western edge of the Corn Belt. Wheat futures were trading higher on rumors of new Soviet purchases of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat and on assurances by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> that grain trade with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> would continue despite international tensions. Rainfall amounts of up to 3 inches were reported in parts of <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> with smaller amounts recorded in southwestern <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. `` That's supposedly going to be coming right across here, although we're not expecting anything of that amount,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gidel </PERSON>, research director with <ORGANIZATION> LIT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a commodities brokerage firm in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. The corn and soybean markets also were pressured by dry conditions over the weekend in the eastern half of the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, where higher-than-normal spring rainfall left some fields too wet for planting. In early trading, wheat was -LCB- cent to 2 cents higher with the contract for delivery in July at $ 3.99 -LCB- a bushel; corn was 4 -LCB- cents to 8 -RCB- cents lower with July at $ 2.57 -LCB- a bushel; oats were 2 -LCB- cents to 5 cents lower with July at $ 1.50 a bushel; soybeans were 11 -LCB- cents to 20 cents lower with July at $ 7.19 -LCB- a bushel. Livestock and meat futures were mostly higher in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle were .02 cent lower to .18 cent higher with August at 69.85 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent to .43 cent higher with August at 81.55 cents a pound; live hogs were .13 cent to .60 cent higher with July at 49.97 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .35 cent to .73 cent higher with July at 34.37 cents a pound. Cattle futures settled lower on Friday while pork futures were mixed.

<HEAD>High Court To Consider Killing Suit on Alleged Bribe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today agreed to consider killing a lawsuit growing out of the development of an aeromedical center in <LOCATION> Kaduna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>. The court said it will review a decision requiring W.S. <ORGANIZATION> Kirkpatrick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> corporation, to defend itself against allegations that it won the contract by illegally bribing <LOCATION> Nigerian </LOCATION> government officials. Those allegations are raised in a suit filed by <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tectonics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> investigation of the 1981 contract between <PERSON> Kirkpatrick </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> Nigerian </LOCATION> government led to <PERSON> Kirkpatrick </PERSON>'s pleading guilty to one count of violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act <PERSON> Kirkpatrick </PERSON> was fined $ 75,000. Environmental Tectonics, which had submitted a lower bid for the Nigerian contract, then sued <PERSON> Kirkpatrick </PERSON>. Its lawsuit alleged that Environmental Tectonics would have been awarded the contract but for <PERSON> Kirkpatrick </PERSON>'s payment of bribes. A federal judge dismissed the suit, relying on the so-called `` act of state doctrine.'' It precludes <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> courts from inquiring into the validity of a foreign government's acts committed within its own territory. The 3rd U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, however, reinstated the suit last year. `` The traditional justification for invoking the doctrine _ avoiding a judicial determination of the legal validity of a state's act within its own borders _ is not present in this case,'' the appeals court said. <PERSON> Kirkpatrick </PERSON> then sought the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s help.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> today rejected plans to create a single European currency and a central bank but pledged to accept some elements of a plan to form a united <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> market by late 1992. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, however, urged the leaders of the 12-nation <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> to endorse the single currency and central bank. French President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, also enthusiastic about a sole currency and central bank, said he may renege on an agreement to lift controls on the movement of the French franc if <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> holds up the economic union plan. Under the plan being considered at an <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> summit in <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>, member states would gradually hand over economic policy-making power to the EEC. Surrendering aspects of national sovereignty is a key issue as the community heads toward dropping all trade barriers and creating the single market in 1992. `` Decisions on these matters are simply not on the current agenda,'' <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> officials quoted Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> as telling the closed-door summit meeting. `` We must stick to the practical and go for what needs to be done now.'' The leaders adjourned for lunch on the first day of the two-day summit with aides seeking to draw up a compromise position. West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> pressed the leaders to accept the plan in its entirety, said his spokesman, <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>. As part of endorsing the first stage of the plan, which would begin in July 1990, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> pledged to link the pound to the other major <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> currencies by joining the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System. But a British spokesman, who requested anonymity, said Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> would join the European Monetary system if <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s 8.3 percent inflation rate was `` reduced significantly,'' other <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> countries abolish exchange controls by July 1990 and the community allows an open market in banking and financial services. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> argued that earlier membership of the currency alignment by <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> could have shaken the entire system. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> is the only major oil producer in the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>, and the pound is boosted by oil price increases, which tend to depress the other currencies. Since <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> joined last week, only <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> are outside the system. <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Solbes </PERSON>, spokesman for <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, said that despite the disagreement over monetary union, `` the atmosphere was positive in general.'' `` But we should n't be led into fooling ourselves ... We're going to have to work very hard ... There's only a slim possibility of an agreement but it is worth making the effort,'' he added. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> remained isolated on the second major issue at the meeting _ proposals for community-wide regulations guaranteeing workers' rights, including representation on company boards. Earlier, <ORGANIZATION> Lord </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plumb </ORGANIZATION>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>'s legislature, cautioned summit leaders in an opening address that `` all these issues strike at the heart of national decision-making. `` It is not surprising that in the past, the expressions of grand aspiration have not always produced quick results,'' said Plumb, a British conservative. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, criticized within her Conservative Party for her often-combative stance toward the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>, has adopted a more conciliatory tone in <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>, stressing <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s commitment to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Late Sunday, as the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> leaders assembled for their semiannual meeting, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> indicated that it will settle for a declaration of `` political will'' as opposed to a firm commitment on the two final stages of monetary union. `` I see possibilities that we will come to a common position,'' said <PERSON> Lutz </PERSON> <PERSON> Stavenhagen </PERSON>, a senior aide to <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>. `` But we do n't want to go into the blue. We need the political will to come to an end.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s aides discounted reports that the prime minister feels she is in a weaker position because of her party's defeat by <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in elections this month for the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. The latest British opinion poll, by <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, was published Sunday and showed the Conservatives trailing Labor by 14 points. The other Common Market members are <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>.

 Prices on <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> shrugged off further weakness in the pound to close higher Monday, paced by gains in dollar-earning stocks. But trading activity was subdued in advance of Tuesday's release of British trade figures for May. Also overshadowing the market was suspense over the outcome of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> summit meeting debate in <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> on progress toward monetary union. At the close, the <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times-Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> 100-share index was up 12.1 points, or 0.6 percent, at 2,179.6. Volume was 369.9 million shares, down from 490.3 million shares on Friday. The market was boosted from the outset by a favorable response to Wall Street's strong gains on Friday. A lack of selling pressure maintained the positive trend, even after the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> market opened lower during the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> afternoon. There was widespread caution, however, as traders speculated that an adverse reaction by the pound to the British trade figures or to the <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> summit could trigger a sharp correction in share prices. `` The performance of sterling is by far the overriding situation,'' one dealer said.

<HEAD>One Solution To Housing Affordability</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 First-time home buyers are on a financial treadmill: Unable to afford a 20 percent down payment, they rent instead, paying out so much each month that little remains for savings. So common is the situation that nearly everyone knows someone caught in that bind. Statistics seem to document it. Homeownership for households in the 25-29 age group fell to 36.2 percent in 1988 from 43.3 percent in 1980. The primary reason for this trend, which directly contradicts the dearly held notion that opportunity keeps growing in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, is the inability of renter households to raise cash for a down payment and closing costs. That conclusion was reached this month in a study by the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, which suggested the distribution of economic opportunity in American society was thereby becoming polarized. It was n't the first time that conclusion was reached. In fact, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> hearings were held this month on a National Affordable Housing Act, which seeks to break the stalemate in a manner fair to both renters and homeowners. No one proposal is likely to get things moving again in the lower tier of housing markets, although it is widely agreed that federal tax incentives and mortgage subsidies and outright government grants might spur some activity. But in an age in which privatization attracts considerable attention, little of that attention is directed to a reasonable and intelligent solution that is so private it remains within the family. Simply stated, the solution is the opportunity for those with housing equity, such as parents, to pass on that equity to offspring. The justice of it is unassailable. The reason some current owners have such a large supply of equity is inflation. It is one of the most important reasons, if not the primary reason, why their children can not afford to buy. The tax system seems to approve. A portion of equity can be transferred by the owner without tax complications. In fact, there could be tax advantages should the owner borrow on a primary residence to finance an offspring's home. The money could be in the form of a gift or gifts, or it could be as a loan. In the latter case, the rationale seems impeccable: It would help a loved one, it would be a well-secured loan, it would mean a high yield to the lender. In fact, where in the vast universe of investments would a lender _ call him or her an investor or saver, if you prefer _ find a sounder use for long-term money? Mortgage money, remember, is lent at 10 percent or more. The timing may be propitious too. Many parents are beginning to think of the day when they can retire, and that happy dream is almost instantly followed by the worrisome topic of retirement income. Here it is, a monthly check. The <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> report, from its <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>, notes that only 11.5 percent, or 1.28 million, of the estimated 11.1 million renter households in the 25-34 age group have sufficient assets and income to buy a starter home. Of that 11.1 million, the bigger of the drawbacks is assets, not income. Many thousands of renters therefore would seem to qualify for a low-cost starter home if they had the down payment. Lacking it, they rent, and hope that their ability to save is stronger than the advance in housing prices. If it is n't, they fall behind, and all because of a down payment that already resides within the family.

 Stock prices gave ground today as traders cashed in some of the gains that carried the market to new post-crash highs on Friday. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 49.70 points Friday, dropped 13.09 to 2,518.78 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street. Losers slightly outnumbered gainers in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 661 up, 744 down and 497 unchanged. The market's climb last week to new peaks since the debacle in the fall of 1987 was spurred by accumulating evidence of a slowing economy. As interest rates fell in the credit markets, rumors circulated that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> might soon lower its discount rate, the charge it sets on loans to private financial institutions. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> took no such step immediately, however, and traders began the new week in a more cautious mood. Brokers also noted that the market was running out of support from `` window dressing'' by money managers at investing institutions readying their portfolios for midyear reports to clients. <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> rose 2 | to 168 -LCB- After the close on Friday <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION>, bidding to wrest Time away from a planned merger with <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION>, increased its offer for Time from $ 175 a share to $ 200 a share.

 Futures prices of corn and soybeans closed sharply lower Monday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> amid rain forecasts. Wheat futures finished mostly higher on signs of large Soviet purchases of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat. Most corn contracts plunged more than 9 cents a bushel following a wetter-than-expected weekend in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> and southwestern <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. More moisture was expected in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> as the cold front moved east. `` Two-thirds of the Corn Belt is expected to get rain today and tomorrow,'' said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON>, a trader with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Talk circulated that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had bought at least 500,000 metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat on the open market. Analysts said the buying indicated that the Soviets needed wheat immediately, since they usually buy <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain through a subsidy program, which takes longer. At the close of trading, wheat was 3 -LCB- cents lower to 4 -LCB- cents higher with the contract for delivery in July at $ 4.02 a bushel; corn was 4 -LCB- cents to 9 -LCB- cents lower with July at $ 2.57 -LCB- a bushel; oats were 3 -RCB- cents to 5 cents lower with July at $ 1.48 \ a bushel; soybeans were 1 cent to 12 -LCB- cents lower with July at $ 7.30 a bushel

 <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> will move its 6,000-worker merchandising hub from downtown <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> to suburban <ORGANIZATION> Hoffman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estates </ORGANIZATION>, the giant retailer announced Monday in capping a bidding war between <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and the Sunbelt for the facility. <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> won the contest with the aid of a $ 61 million package of incentives, which was backed by local tax incentives reportedly totaling up to $ 178 million. `` We believe this Chicagoland location will serve the best interests of our company and its shareholders for decades to come,'' Chairman <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said at a morning news conference in the downtown Sears Tower. Last fall, the nation's largest retailer announced a restructuring plan that includes selling the 110-story Sears Tower _ the world's tallest building _ and shifting the <ORGANIZATION> Merchandise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> hub to less costly quarters. The announcement set off a fierce competition between <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Sunbelt </ORGANIZATION> states, especially <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> offered a $ 61 million package of incentives to keep the Merchandise Group headquarters, said Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, who joined <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> at the news conference. <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hedges </PERSON>, director of the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> would continue paying taxes, but about 80 percent of the tax revenue would be used for development costs of the Hoffman Estates project. <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> will recoup its investment during the <ORGANIZATION> Merchandise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>'s fifth year in its new headquarters, <PERSON> Hedges </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Hoffman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estates </ORGANIZATION> offered a 20-year plan of tax incentives. The <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> Tribute in Monday's editions quoted an unnamed source as valuing the village's incentives at $ 178 million, although neither state nor village officials would confirm the figure. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Burchard </PERSON>, village manager in the middle-class suburb of 45,000, said local taxing districts would get $ 67 million in revenue over the life of the local plan. <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> estimates that building a campus-style facility on the 200 acres it plans to use in <ORGANIZATION> Hoffman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estates </ORGANIZATION> will cost about $ 220 million. The rest of the tract also will be commercially developed and <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> hopes to draw other corporate offices to the site, <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> _ which began in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> in 1887 _ was expected to begin moving the merchandising operation to the Hoffman Estates site, about 30 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, in 2 -LCB- to three years. When the <ORGANIZATION> Merchandise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> move is completed, about 600 employees of <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> corporate staff will remain in the downtown <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said. `` We understand the strong ties which <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> has to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and know that the people of that great city are pleased to have the decision in their favor,'' said <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Charlotte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>. `` We understood all along that <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> was probably <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>' first choice,'' <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> also said <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> had been the company's first choice, but he believed it was his responsibility to <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> shareholders to look at other prospective sites. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said the incentive package was the biggest the state has ever put together to keep jobs in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> offered $ 88 million to entice <ORGANIZATION> Diamond-Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> to Normal in 1985.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> has a reputation as a numbers man, and his decision to keep the <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merchandise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> area is backed by some persuasive figures. Local tax breaks that reportedly could total $ 178 million, for starters. But it is possible that sentimental factors also came into play as <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> and his team weighed the pros and cons of 50 potential sites before settling on <ORGANIZATION> Hoffman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estates </ORGANIZATION>, a suburb about 30 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Less than a month ago, rumors had the 6,000 employees of the retailing unit's headquarters packed up and ready to roll to <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> was also in the running. But the decision announced Monday suggests that <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>' century-old <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> roots may run deeper than the Sunbelt sun could reach <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> grew up here. And <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> grew up with it. His grandfather, father, mother and two uncles all worked for the company at a rambling West Side complex that contained distribution facilities and, until the completion of <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION> in 1974, the company's headquarters. <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> joined <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> as a clerk in <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, in 1956, just after graduating from college, and moved to the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> headquarters as a buyer in 1959. His climb up the corporate ladder entailed a series of out-of-state assignments from 1967 until 1980, when he was brought back to <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> as head of the <ORGANIZATION> Merchandise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. In addition to the <ORGANIZATION> Merchandise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> owns the <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> group </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Allstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> and the Coldwell Banker real estate concern. <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> has no great love for <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION>, the world's tallest building, which the company is selling as part of its cost-cutting plan. Nevertheless, his office will remain on the 68th floor of the 110-story skyscraper, after the retail group moves out. The relocation of the retailing headquarters will recreate for those workers the sort of working environment that <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> found so agreeable as a young <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> executive. `` When you are housed in a vertical structure, you have less people interaction than when you are in a low-rise, campus-type environment,'' he said in an interview late last year. `` You have a more cohesive organization when there's more people interaction.'' The sale of the tower may occur by the end of this year, said analyst <ORGANIZATION> Monroe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Greenstein </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, who said <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> insiders had told him they were in no rush to sell the building. <PERSON> Greenstein </PERSON> said the decision to move the retailing group to the suburbs satisfied three major criteria. First, he said, <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> will avoid major disruptions of its retailing operations, a particularly sensitive point because the company recently launched an ambitious effort to lure more consumers to its stores by offering lower prices and more brand names. Second, in addition to the 200-acre building site, the deal includes 700 acres along an expressway, including an outdoor music theater called <LOCATION> Poplar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> said the theater will continue operating and <PERSON> Greenstein </PERSON> said Sear's commercialization of the remaining land will pay for the construction of the <ORGANIZATION> Merchandise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>'s new headquarters. Third, <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> got all those tax breaks. <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> offered a $ 61 million package of incentives. Also, the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> quoted unidentified sources Monday saying the village's incentives were worth $ 178 million, although neither state nor village officials would confirm the amount. <PERSON> Greenstein </PERSON> and others said <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> ruled out <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> because it would not have been a convenient destination for foreign visitors, especially <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>' suppliers from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>.

 Here, at a glance, are highlights of actions taken Monday by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in business-related cases: FRAUD The court made it easier to use a key anti-racketeering law in civil lawsuits against businesses accused of fraud. The court unanimously ruled that the law applies to more than what is traditionally described as organized crime. The case is H.J. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION>, 87-1252. STRIKERS The court agreed to set guidelines on when employers may withdraw recognition of a labor union after hiring new workers to break a strike. The court said it will hear a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration appeal of a ruling favoring an employer in a case stemming from a 1979 strike against a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> laboratory supplies company. The case is <ORGANIZATION> NLRB </ORGANIZATION> vs. <PERSON> Curtin </PERSON> <PERSON> Matheson </PERSON>, 88-1685. LAWYER FEES The court rejected an appeal by an <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> doctor ordered to pay $ 254,000 in lawyers' fees to those who successfully challenged a state abortion law. The court, consistent with a ruling by the justices last week in an airline industry bias case, let stand a lower court ruling stemming from a 1979 lawsuit challenging an <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> abortion-regulating law that included criminal penalties for physicians who violated it. The case is Diamond vs. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, 88-664. AMOS ` N' ANDY The court let stand a ruling that <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> no longer enjoys trademark protection for the `` Amos ` N' Andy'' radio and television shows. The justices, without comment, refused to review a federal appeals court ruling that <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> abandoned the trademarks when, under pressure from civil rights groups, it suspended commercial use of the shows. The case is <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> vs. <PERSON> Silverman </PERSON>, 88-1804. PUNITIVE DAMAGES The court ruled the Constitution's ban on excessive fines places no limit on how much money can be won in personal-injury lawsuits. By a 7-2 vote, the justices refused to extend the prohibition against the excessive fines to civil as well as criminal cases. But the justices left open the possibility that the Constitution's due-process requirements could put a lid on punitive damage awards. That issue was not raised properly in the case decided today. The case is <ORGANIZATION> Browning-Ferris </ORGANIZATION> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Kelco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disposal </ORGANIZATION>, 88-556.

 The number of working oil and natural gas rigs continued an upward climb this week, growing by 15 rigs to total 810, according to <ORGANIZATION> Baker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The increase marked the fifth straight weekly gain for the nationwide count, which increased by four rigs last week. A year ago, the count totaled 894, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> reported Monday. The company's rig count _ the widely watched industry index of drilling activity _ reflects the number of rigs actively exploring for oil as of last Friday, not the number of rigs actively producing oil. Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tool </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, an oil toolmaker company that merged with <ORGANIZATION> Baker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, has kept track of the rig count since 1940. In December 1981, at the height of the oil boom, the rig count reached a peak of 4,500. But oil prices plunged to less than $ 10 per 42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986, prompting a collapse in the rig count that bottomed out at 663 _ the lowest since <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> began compiling figures.

 The dollar ended higher Monday against most major currencies following last week's selloff. Gold prices declined. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> quoted a troy ounce of gold at $ 374 as of 4 p.m. EDT, down $ 3 from late Friday. Currency dealers attributed the dollar's rebound largely to technical factors following last week's decline, which some analysts described as a correction in an otherwise bullish market. `` The market was inclined to buy,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, senior trader at <ORGANIZATION> Irving </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. Dealers said there were reports of dollar-selling by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>, but that had little effect on the market. The British pound, meanwhile, came under continued selling pressure despite intervention by the Bank of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. Traders said there were no new factors pressuring the pound Monday. But sterling has been depressed recently by worries about industrial unrest, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s trade deficit and inflation, which is currently running at 8 percent. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it cost $ 1.5450 to buy one pound, cheaper for buyers than $ 1.5675 late Friday. Later, in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, sterling fetched $ 1.5447, down from 1.5645. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar fell 0.17 Japanese yen to a closing 140.18 yen. It was quoted higher at 140.65 yen in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, and at 141.10 yen in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, up from 138.85 yen late Friday. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with Friday, included: 1.9590 West German marks, up from 1.9425; 1.6882 Swiss francs, up from 1.6660; 1.1940 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1942; 6.6480 French francs, up from 6.6000; and 1,416.00 Italian lire, up from 1,410.50. Late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with Friday, included: 1.9552 West German marks, up from 1.9390; 1.6840 Swiss francs, up from 1.6690; 6.6380 French francs, up from 6.5790; 2.2003 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1850; 1,414.00 Italian lire, up from 1,412.50; and 1.1940 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1910. On the Commodity Exchange in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, gold bullion for current delivery closed at $ 375.10 a troy ounce, down from Friday's $ 378.50 bid.

 <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, angered by <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s rejection of a single European currency and central bank, threatened Monday to renege on an agreement that forms part of the drive for a united European market by 1992. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> refused at the opening session of a two-day summit to embrace a plan for a tight monetary union of the 12 nations of the European Economic Community. Her opposition prompted French President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> to threaten to renege on promises for more liberalized money markets. `` If there is no agreement ... as a totality, then countries who are committed to lifting exchange controls could be led to revise their position,'' a French spokesman quoted <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> as saying in the closed-door session. Spanish officials worked late Monday trying to win backing for a four-point compromise proposal to submit to the leaders Tuesday, the final day of the semi-annual summit. Its most controversial point seeks backing for moves to create a common central bank. The leaders had gone into the summit at odds over key parts of the plan, supported most enthusiastically by <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and opposed by <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. This split surfaced in their daylong closed-door talks. `` The rough work was in the hands of President <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, who said it quite strongly, while the nuances were with'' West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>,'' said Dutch Prime Minister <PERSON> Ruud </PERSON> <PERSON> Lubbers </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> urged his colleagues to accept the far-reaching changes. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said she supported closer monetary and economic cooperation but objected to the two subsequent stages that would lead to a single central bank and a common currency in the trading bloc. `` Decisions on these matters are simply not on the current agenda,'' a British official quoted Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> as telling other leaders during the closed-door session. `` We must stick to the practical and go for what needs to be done now.'' <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> was backed at times by <LOCATION> The </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION>. The moves for monetary union have added a new dimension to the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>'s plans to fashion a single market by the end of 1992. By that date, the nations want to remove the many trade barriers that prevent the free movement of people, goods, services and money. Officials said there was general agreement the 12 nations should cooperate more in economic and monetary matters. `` We commit ourselves to the goal of the economic and monetary union process,'' said the British official. `` What we have not committed ourselves to is a process as defined in -LRB- the report -RRB-.'' As part of endorsing a first stage of the plan, which would begin in July 1990, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> pledged to link the pound to the other major <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> currencies by joining the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System. But Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> would join the system only if <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s 8.3 percent inflation rate was `` reduced significantly,'' other <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> nations abolished controls on their currencies by July 1990 and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> provides for an open market in banking and financial services. Only the currencies of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> are not full members. <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> members are: <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Court Eases Use of Racketeering Law in Civil Suits</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled Monday that federal anti-racketeering law is not just aimed at mobsters, making it easier to use the statute in lawsuits against businesses being sued for fraud. The court unanimously reinstated a lawsuit against <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> by <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> consumers. The civil suit accused the utility of violating the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> may have passed the RICO law because of `` the perceived need to combat organized crime,'' Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said for the court. `` But <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for cogent reasons chose to enact a more general statute, one which, although it had organized crime as its focus, was not limited in application to organized crime.'' In another case, the high court agreed to set guidelines on when employers may withdraw recognition of a labor union after hiring new workers to break a strike. The RICO case, which accused Northwestern Bell of bribing state public utility officials, had been dismissed by the 8th <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>. The appeals court ruled that the phone company's customers failed to prove `` a pattern of racketeering activity'' required to make a case under RICO. The consumers claim that the utility began in 1981 illegal attempts to win rate increases by offering gifts, employment and other favors to members of the <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utilities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. The 8th Circuit said a single fraudulent scheme is insufficient, ruling that at least two schemes must be alleged. But <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> rejected that argument, saying that to prove a pattern of racketeering activity, a private plaintiff or a prosecutor must show at least two criminal acts `` within a single scheme that were related and that amounted to, or threatened the likelihood of, continued criminal activity.'' Other federal appeals courts have allowed civil RICO suits based on numerous acts advancing only one fraudulent scheme. RICO claims are often found in lawsuits involving virtually any business dispute. The stigma attached to being linked in public court documents to alleged racketeering can be powerful leverage for out-of-court settlements. Winners of RICO cases may collect triple damages and lawyer fees, which generally are not available under state anti-fraud laws. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyers, in court papers submitted last year, sided with the phone customers, urging a broad interpretation of the RICO law. Also backing the customers were 14 states: <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>. But other interests urged the high court to bar the lawsuit. The <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>, for example, said that `` private civil RICO actions have become a tool of harassment ... against legitimate businesses and labor organizations.'' In the strike-breaker case, the court agreed to hear a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration appeal of a ruling stemming from a 1979 strike against a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> laboratory supplies company. <ORGANIZATION> Curtin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Matheson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scientific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> was struck in 1979 by workers at its <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> warehouse after a union contract expired and the company locked out all 27 <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> union members employed there. Five of the 27 employees crossed the picket line when the strike began June 13, 1979, and 12 days later, the company hired 29 new employees to replace the remaining 22 strikers. When the union later offered to end the strike under terms previously offered by management, the company withdrew the offer along with its recognition of the union as the workers' bargaining agent. The National Labor Relations Board in 1987 said the company illegally withdrew its recognition of the union but the 5th <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> overruled the board last November. In other decisions announced Monday, the high court: _ Ruled, 7-2, that skyrocketing punitive damages awards in personal injury lawsuits do not violate the Constitution's ban on excessive fines The decision left open the possibility that such hefty awards violate due-process rights. _ Ordered a lower court to restudy a dispute over drug and alcohol testing for transit workers employed by the <ORGANIZATION> Southeastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> _ Decided to review a decision requiring W.S <ORGANIZATION> Kirkpatrick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> corporation, to defend itself against allegations that it bribed <LOCATION> Nigerian </LOCATION> government officials to win a contract to develop an aeromedical center. _ Let stand a ruling that <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> no longer enjoys trademark protection for the `` Amos ` N' Andy'' radio and television shows

<HEAD>Coffee Futures Sag To 11-Month Low On International Discord</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Coffee futures prices sagged to an 11-month low Monday on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Coffee, <ORGANIZATION> Sugar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> amid growing pessimism about the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coffee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>'s ability to keep its grip on price controls. On other markets, orange juice futures soared; corn and soybean futures dropped while wheat advanced; livestock and meat futures rallied; oil futures rose; and precious metals slumped. <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, unroasted coffee settled 1.63 cents to 6.05 cents lower with the contract for delivery in July at $ 1.11 a pound, the market's lowest close since Aug. 2, 1988. The sell-off was sparked by news Friday that <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, the world's second-largest coffee producer, would move to abolish all export quotas unless members of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coffee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> approve a new price-support agreement at their meeting next Monday in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. The ICO, composed of 74 major coffee-producing and consuming nations, attempts to control coffee prices by limiting the amount of coffee that each producer country may sell to the consumers. Discord among the members has led to fears that the current 6-year agreement will expire Sept. 30 without a pact to succeed it, leaving coffee prices open to free-market forces for the first time since 1963. <ORGANIZATION> ICO </ORGANIZATION> members will consider two proposals next week, one to extend the current agreement with no change in quotas and the other to extend the agreement with changes to increase the availability of mild arabica coffees, the type most in demand. `` The two proposals are expected to be voted on but both are expected to be rejected,'' said <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaul </PERSON>, a coffee-market analyst in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Traders fear that if <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> introduces a motion to abandon all quotas, other producer countries will approve it and coffee will flood the market Orange juice futures settled at or near the 5-cents-a-pound daily limit on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cotton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> despite a lack of fresh supply-and-demand news. The market has been rising on supply concerns linked to the slow pace of the Brazilian orange harvest. Frozen concentrated orange juice settled 3.85 cents to 5 cents higher with July at $ 1.86 a pound. Corn and soybean futures fell steeply on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> amid rain forecasts for the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, but wheat futures finished mostly higher on signs of large Soviet purchases of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat. Talk circulated that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had bought at least 500,000 metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat on the open market. Wheat settled 3 -LCB- cents lower to 4 \ cents higher with July at $ 4.01 -RCB- a bushel; corn was 4 \ cents to 9 -LCB- cents lower with July at $ 2.57 -RCB- a bushel; oats were 3 -RCB- cents to 5 cents lower with July at $ 1.48 \ a bushel; soybeans were unchanged to 12 cents lower with July at $ 7.31 Frozen pork-belly futures leaped on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> following Friday's monthly cold-storage report from the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which pegged belly supplies much lower than expected. Frozen pork bellies settled .90 cent to 2 cents higher with July at 35.55 cents a pound; live cattle were .15 cent lower to .73 cent higher with August at 70.60 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent to .48 cent higher with August at 81.52 cents a pound; live hogs were .05 cent lower to .60 cent higher with July at 49.97 cents a pound. Crude oil futures surpassed $ 20 a barrel on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> as the energy market rallied for the sixth straight day on supply fears and technical factors. West Texas Intermediate crude settled 9 cents to 54 cents higher with August at $ 20.25 a barrel; heating oil was .13 cent to .22 cent higher with July at 49.65 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .15 cent to .77 cent higher with July at 63.69 cents a gallon. Gold futures retreated on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> following strong gains last week. Analysts said a stronger dollar kept the market under pressure. Gold settled $ 3.40 to $ 4 lower with August at $ 378.30 an ounce; silver was 2.3 cents to 2.4 cents lower with July at $ 5.31 a troy ounce.

 Toy executive <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassenfeld </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive of <ORGANIZATION> Hasbro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, was praised Monday as unequaled among his peers, but his death left questions about the company's future. <PERSON> Hassenfeld </PERSON>, 47, died of pneumonia and cardiac arrest Sunday night at <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Presbyterian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, where he had been hospitalized for four weeks, said <ORGANIZATION> Hasbro </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Charness </PERSON>. `` I believe that within the next year, you will see the company sold. It's an attractive property in the industry,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Valentine </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poor </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Valentine </PERSON> said he expected <PERSON> Hassenfeld </PERSON>'s family, which owns 13.1 percent of the Pawtucket-based toymaker, eventually would re-examine its position `` With <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> gone and the company now a larger, more bureaucratic organization, the fun has probably gone out of this business for the <PERSON> Hassenfeld </PERSON> family,'' he said. Valentine estimated the sale price at $ 32 per share, but higher if the company performs better than expected this year. <ORGANIZATION> Hasbro </ORGANIZATION> common stock closed at $ 22.25, up 25, cents on the American Exchange Monday. Its volume of nearly 1.2 million shares made it the second most heavily traded issue on the exchange. But, said analyst <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirchberger </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, `` <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON>'s absence does n't mean the company is without a leader. ... That's not to say that <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> wo n't be missed but there are competent and qualified people'' to run the company. <PERSON> Charness </PERSON> did not know when <ORGANIZATION> Hasbro </ORGANIZATION> directors would meet to select a successor. <ORGANIZATION> Hasbro </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassenfeld </PERSON>, 40, who is <PERSON> Hassenfeld </PERSON>'s brother, has run the company in combination with a team of senior management. `` We continue as we have for the last month,'' <PERSON> Charness </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hassenfeld </PERSON> built <ORGANIZATION> Hasbro </ORGANIZATION> into a toy giant, with more than $ 1.3 billion in sales from well-known products including G.I. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON>, Transformers, My Little Pony and Mr. Potato Head. The company's revenue was just $ 102 million 10 years ago <PERSON> Hassenfeld </PERSON> bought companies such as the <ORGANIZATION> Milton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bradley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in 1984 and developed a diverse line of low-cost products, although the company last year scrapped plans for an interactive video and electronic game system called Nemo after reportedly spending millions of dollars on research and development. <ORGANIZATION> Hasbro </ORGANIZATION> recently announced it would acquire assets of financially troubled <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Avon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, maker of Cabbage Patch Kids and other toys. `` <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassenfield </PERSON> stands out virtually without a peer in the toy industry over the past 10 years. He created what I refer to as the modern American toy company. A broadly based, well diversified toy company,'' <PERSON> Valentine </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hassenfeld </PERSON>, who was born in <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION>, joined <ORGANIZATION> Hasbro </ORGANIZATION> in 1964 and was named executive vice president of marketing and elected to the board of directors in 1968. He became president in 1974 and chairman in 1980. In mid-1987, <PERSON> Hassenfeld </PERSON> was treated, also at <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> Presbyterian, for what he later said was endocarditis, a bacterial infection of the heart valve and lining. His brother said <PERSON> Hassenfeld </PERSON> never fully recovered from the heart infection, partly because he was allergic to antibiotics used to treat the illness. Word of <PERSON> Hassenfeld </PERSON>'s illness a month ago prompted heavy trading in <ORGANIZATION> Hasbro </ORGANIZATION> stock. At the time, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Hasbro </ORGANIZATION>'s chief financial officer, dismissed rumors of a hostile takeover. The <PERSON> Hassenfeld </PERSON> family owns 13.1 percent of the company stock and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> owns 13.6 percent in a voting trust controlled by the <PERSON> Hassenfeld </PERSON> brothers. <ORGANIZATION> Hasbro </ORGANIZATION> has the right of first refusal to purchase <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>'s stock Nevertheless, <ORGANIZATION> Hasbro </ORGANIZATION> adopted a `` poison pill'' earlier this month which would give existing shareholders the right to by additional stock in the event of a hostile takeover.

 Stock prices turned downward Monday as traders cashed in some of the gains that carried the market to new post-crash highs last week. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 49.70 points on Friday, dropped back 20.49 to 2,511.38. Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 4 to 3 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 630 up, 840 down and 498 unchanged.

The market's climb last week to new peaks since the debacle in the fall of 1987 was spurred by accumulating evidence of a slowing economy. As interest rates fell in the credit markets, rumors circulated that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> might soon lower its discount rate, the charge it sets on loans to private financial institutions. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> took no such step immediately, however, and traders began the new week in a more cautious mood. Brokers also noted that the market was running out of support from `` window dressing'' by money managers at investing institutions readying their portfolios for midyear reports to clients.

 Energy futures finished higher Monday, led by a surge in crude oil prices. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the August contract for <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION>, the benchmark grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude, broke through the $ 20 level, settling 54 cents higher at $ 20.25 a barrel. The contract had traded as low as $ 19.78 during the session. September crude rose 47 cents to close at $ 19.42 a barrel, while contracts for later delivery posted more modest gains. Among refined products, the July contract for unleaded gasoline advanced 0.77 cent to finish at 63.69 cents a gallon and heating oil rose 0.16 cent to 49.65 cents a gallon. Other contract months also finished higher. With little economic news to drive prices, analysts attributed Monday's advances mainly to technical factors and to OPEC-related news. Two separate publications reported that <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> oil output, while still above the quota set by the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION>, is declining. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> at a meeting earlier this month had rejected its OPEC-imposed production ceiling and set its own quota, saying it needed to exploit its massive oil reserves. `` The reports came through, the market reacted briefly but the impact was n't lasting,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Hiley </PERSON>, energy analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s oil minister <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalifa </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Sabah </PERSON> also was quoted as denying that <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> increased its oil sales after the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> meeting in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, earlier this month The minister said that the emirate's sales blitz, which started before the conference, was halted within days of the meeting's conclusion.

<HEAD>Executives Leaving as Part of Previously Announced Cuts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Five <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> executives are retiring or being reassigned as part of a streamlining program that includes the previously announced elimination of 2,500 to 3,000 rank-and-file jobs. The moves announced Monday come as the company faces congressional efforts to cut spending on its premier program, the B-2 stealth bomber, and as longtime chief executive <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> transfers power to his successor. Retiring are two senior vice presidents: C.R. `` Bob'' <PERSON> Gates </PERSON>, 64, who headed international marketing, and <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON>, 52, in charge of programs. <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON> will leave active management but continue as a consultant on fighter plane development, the company said. Three vice-presidents' jobs under <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON> are being cut, said spokesman <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Cantafio </PERSON>. The company has previously said that it would cut its workforce by 2,500 to 3,000 by the end of the year. The main reason given for the cuts is that the B-2 is moving from development to production, and fewer workers are required. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, the chairman and chief executive who will pass CEO's responsibilities at the end of the year to <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Kresa </PERSON>, president and chief operating officer, told stockholders earlier this year to expect changes in management ranks One industry analyst, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Seidler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amdec </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, saw the changes as moves by <PERSON> Kresa </PERSON> to put his own stamp on management. `` There's nothing unusual here,'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said. `` These are the kinds of things that happen when a new guy comes in.'' Another analyst, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Nisbet </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said elimination of foreign marketing hierarchy makes sense since the company has less overseas business than in the past. It is ending production of the F-5 fighter plane, sold to foreign air forces, and electronics sales also are slower overseas than previously. The three other executives leaving or being reassigned are: <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Oaxaca </PERSON>, vice president of total quality management, retiring in July; <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lovell </PERSON>, vice president of manufacturing, who will go on special assignment to the B-2 division; and <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrier </PERSON>, vice president for program management, who will be transferred to the aircraft division.

 <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Chimerine </PERSON> is stepping down as chairman and chief executive of <ORGANIZATION> WEFA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> subsidiary of an international economic forecasting and consulting firm, `` by mutual consent,'' the parent company said Monday. <ORGANIZATION> WEFA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, the parent company, said <PERSON> Chimerine </PERSON>'s job had been eliminated and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> subsidiary would report to an executive committee, as other subsidiaries do. It said <PERSON> Chimerine </PERSON> would maintain a limited association with the firm as a senior economic adviser and keep his office. <ORGANIZATION> WEFA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, of <PERSON> Bala </PERSON> <PERSON> Cynwyd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, was formed by the merger of <ORGANIZATION> Wharton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Econometric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forecasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chase </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Econometrics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in 1987 and is owned by <ORGANIZATION> WEF </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Basel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. `` There was a changing environment and <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> decided he wanted to pursue other things,'' <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> Vila </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> WEFA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> chairman, said in an interview. <PERSON> Vila </PERSON> said it no longer made sense to have a separate chairman for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> operation because the firm had become multinational. And he said clients were demanding comprehensive business data and advice `` as opposed to narrowly defined macroeconomic forecasting.'' Forecasting is <PERSON> Chimerine </PERSON>'s specialty. <PERSON> Chimerine </PERSON> said he was prevented from discussing the reasons for his departure and called it `` a long story.'' He said his plans were uncertain but would include outside speaking and consulting work. `` I'm delighted,'' he said. `` I've been thinking of doing other things for a long time and this will give me an opportunity to do it.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it intends to cut 250 jobs at its semiconductor operation in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Wang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said it plans to sell a personal computer factory in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> that employs 239 people.

 A non-smokers organization is fired up over a cigarette manufacturer's campaign to have <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> restaurants post signs declaring smokers and non-smokers are welcome. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Godshall </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> NonSmokers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION>, filed a complaint with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> against <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> for failing to include the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION> Surgeon General's tobacco warning in ads promoting `` Accommodation: The New Sign of the Times.'' The nation's largest cigarette manufacturer placed ads in newspapers and billboards advising people to look for a red-and-green emblem at restaurants showing that they have designated areas for smokers and non-smokers. <PERSON> Godshall </PERSON> on Monday condemned the campaign `` as an attempt to encourage people to smoke.'' But <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Zuke </PERSON> said the campaign is `` a way for the business owner to convey a special message to his customers.'' <PERSON> Zuke </PERSON> said FTC rules require cigarette manufacturers to print the Surgeon General's warning that smoking can be dangerous to a person's health on their products and in their ads. He said ads for the <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> campaign promote an idea, not tobacco. `` We would n't bring a campaign to <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> without checking first,'' he said. `` We're promoting rights for smokers and non-smokers ... courtesy and tolerance.'' More than 170 restaurants have agreed to display the emblem, he said. In exchange, the restaurants are mentioned in advertisements appearing in the <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> area over four months. `` We are not paying them anything at all,'' <PERSON> Zuke </PERSON> said. Half of the sign contains a smoking cigarette against a background of green. The non-smoker half of the sign is red. <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> said it chose <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> to launch the campaign because of the number of letters it said it received from customers confused by a smoking ordinance that took effect last year. More customers wrote from <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> than from any other city that restricts smoking in public places, <PERSON> Zuke </PERSON> said.

 The head of the coal miners' union on Monday accepted a new, unconditional offer from Gov. <PERSON> Gaston </PERSON> <PERSON> Caperton </PERSON> for talks aimed at ending a union walkout and related wildcat strikes by nearly 43,000 miners. But the chairman of coal company that is the object of the unrest said he's tied up with jury duty this week. Also Monday, a federal judge in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> fined the union $ 240,000 for its strike tactics against <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION>, while a federal judge in <LOCATION> Clarksburg </LOCATION> refused to order strikers back to work. Wildcat strikes in sympathy with <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> strike against the <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> continued Monday in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>. However, most <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> members began their two-week vacations this week, and the coal fields have been relatively quiet since the weekend. About 350 <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> members in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> ended their wildcat strike Monday and called on <PERSON> Caperton </PERSON> to help end the union's dispute with <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION>. They also asked him to bring a halt to violence that erupted on picket lines in the past week. In addition, a federal judge in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> reset hearings on whether to bar more wildcat strikes and find miners in contempt for ignoring his back-to-work orders. <PERSON> Caperton </PERSON> invited <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> last week to meet at the governor's mansion and hash out a contract. <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> accepted. But <PERSON> Caperton </PERSON> tacked on four conditions that led <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> to reject it: that both sides negotiate in good faith; that <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> not use any other coal companies to fill its orders; that the union end all wildcat strikes; and that other companies suing the <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> because of the strikes suspend their litigation. On Monday, <PERSON> Caperton </PERSON> dropped the conditions and reissued the offer. <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> again accepted. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> declined to say if he would accept, adding he has been called for jury duty in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> this week. However, <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> said from <LOCATION> Pittston </LOCATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, `` Any communication we get from the governor will get due consideration.'' <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> has said its last contract offer, made June 9, will be its best. After the <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> rejected that offer, <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> declared an impasse and imposed its own contract at its operations. About 1,600 <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> miners in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> went on strike against <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> on April 5 after working for 14 months without a contract. They were joined by 300 <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> miners earlier this month. That strike spurred sympathy walkouts around the coal fields. Since June 12, when the wildcat strikes began, 43,000 miners in 10 states have gone off the job. Figures released Monday by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> show that national coal production fell 1.2 million tons, from 19.5 million to 18.3 million, in the week following the start of the wildcat strikes. <PERSON> Caperton </PERSON> said his offer to be host of negotiations has improved the atmosphere in the coal fields. `` It has evidenced itself in the form of a calmer, gentler atmosphere in our coal fields, a sense that something versus nothing is being done,'' he said. A teen-ager was grazed with a bullet on a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> picket line last week, and pickets at a <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> mine overturned a jeep being ridden by a company official. Shots also have been fired at mines in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Knapp </PERSON> reset a hearing for July 3 on five coal companies' request that the <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> and its members be held in contempt for ignoring his back-to-work orders. <PERSON> Knapp </PERSON>'s office also said the judge has reset for July 11 a hearing on 13 companies' request that he issue a preliminary injunction to halt wildcat walkouts in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>. Both of those hearings originally were set for last Friday. In <LOCATION> Abingdon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> ruled that daily convoys on coal hauling roads are being orchestrated by the union and violate his order prohibiting the <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> from blocking the movement of coal trucks. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> found the <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> and two officials in contempt of court and issued fines totaling $ 240,000. In <LOCATION> Clarksburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Kidd </PERSON> denied <ORGANIZATION> Consolidation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s request that he order its union miners back to work in <LOCATION> Monongalia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> counties. <PERSON> Kidd </PERSON> also dissolved a temporary restraining order against picketing at the mines. And in another court development in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary subpoenaed an <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> correspondent's film of a union rally as part of a civil suit it has filed against the <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleischaker </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION> attorney representing correspondent <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION>, said he intends to fight the company's request.

 About 200 people crowded into a federal courtroom Monday to protest <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s proposed settlement of a discrimination suit. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Feikens </PERSON> told the black workers he would consider their objections to the settlement and make a decision in the case soon, said <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Quick </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a spokesman for the Concerned Black Salaried Employees of <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION>. The group last week called for the black community to boycott <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> products until it wins a more favorable settlement in the suit, first filed in 1983 by four salaried black <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> workers. The suit was certified in 1986 as a class action on behalf of 10,000 such workers in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. If accepted, the settlement would amount to $ 20 million to $ 40 million over the next five years for the plaintiffs, their attorneys have said. `` The proposal is grossly inadequate and calls for setting up a double-model standard to monitor black salaries versus white, which represents a problem in itself,'' said Quick, 52, of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, a former <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> personnel administrator. Quick said the automaker's proposal to monitor black workers' pay and promotion for five years and to assess that information using computer models for comparable white employees establishes a double standard. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> also has offered to pay cash settlements to some workers and raise the salaries of othes. But the automaker does not admit to discriminating against blacks in pay and promotions.

<HEAD>Ford Idles Two Plants An Extra Week</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said Monday that it will idle its <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> assembly plants for a third week after their normal two-week summer shutdown this year. The week of July 17 will be added to both plants' normal two-week shutdown for changeover from production of 1989 - to 1990-model automobiles, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pitcoff </PERSON> said The extended shutdown resulted from a delay in obtaining parts for 1990 models with new passive restraint systems and was n't meant to reduce inventories, <PERSON> Pitcoff </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> plant employs about 2,300 hourly employees and the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> plant employs about 2,150. Both produce the popular Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable automobiles. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> has about a 54-day supply of Taurus cars and a 59-day supply of Sable cars on hand, compared with a normal 65-day inventory at this time of year, <PERSON> Pitcoff </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Pitcoff </PERSON> was quoted by <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> in Tuesday's editions as saying that the parts delay caused the company to delay the start of 1990 production by a week at each plant. Because of the delay, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> asked its dealers to buy an extra week's worth of 1989 models. But the dealers balked because the company already had begun taking orders for the 1990 models. The dealers' reluctance prompted the company to shut the plants for an extra week.
