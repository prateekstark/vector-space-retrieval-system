<HEAD>Magazine Relies on Reader Loyalty to Pay Libel Bill</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Thousands of Britons, for whom life without Private Eye is unthinkable, are digging into their pockets to rescue the magazine from being bankrupted by a massive libel bill. The response to the $ 1 million award against Private Eye has triggered an extraordinary display of reader loyalty. Contributions totaled $ 80,000 by early August, according to editor <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Hislop </PERSON>. On May 24 a jury ordered Private Eye to pay the record sum to <PERSON> Sonia </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutcliffe </PERSON>, the estranged wife of mass murderer <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutcliffe </PERSON>, the so-called `` <LOCATION> Yorkshire </LOCATION> Ripper,'' for two articles alleging that she tried to sell her story to newspapers. The magazine also was ordered to pay court costs of $ 160,000. The award caused outcry, partly because it far outweighed the damages paid by the state to families of <PERSON> Sutcliffe </PERSON>'s 13 victims. Editor <PERSON> Hislop </PERSON>, 29, said: `` If this is justice then I'm a banana. ... I think this is very nearly the end of Private Eye. We can not possibly pay that amount of damages.'' He then launched an appeal, hoping to get $ 5 from each of the magazine's 210,000 readers. Private Eye's reader loyalty may seem unusual. But then, so is Private Eye. Its semimonthly serving of news, gossip, opinion and satire has kept it afloat with barely a change of format since its birth in 1961, at the dawn of Swinging Sixties <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. With its carefully cultivated air of shabbiness, it still looks like something pasted together in a college basement _ which keeps the street price low at 95 cents a copy. Its 32 pages carry little advertising and it shows no political bias, savaging hypocrisy, pomposity and wrongdoing wherever they appear. `` While other magazines poke fun at contemporary mores, Private Eye pokes fun at real people,'' said <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Loynes </PERSON>, publisher and editor of the industry magazine <ORGANIZATION> U.K. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gazette </ORGANIZATION>. `` Their satire bites at the rich, the famous, the makers and the shakers. It's wickedly satirical, even dangerously satirical.'' Some Private Eye euphemisms, designed to avoid libel problems, have entered the language, such as `` tired and emotional'' for drunk. Lately it has been prominent in investigating the controversial shooting deaths of three Irish terrorism suspects in <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION> last year, and the procedures that caused a British ferry to capsize off <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> in 1987, with 193 lives lost. `` Street of Shame'' reports dark secrets from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s newsrooms. `` Heir of Sorrows'' chronicles Prince <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>' marriage as a tawdry romantic serial. Book reviews invariably debunk the literary darling of the day. <PERSON> Graydon </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, editor of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Spy magazine, says his publication owes its existence to Private Eye and its founding editor, 51-year-old <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ingrams </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ingrams </PERSON> was a guiding spirit and we've always appreciated the sauciness and the great investigations,'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. Since the libel blow, each issue includes a page listing several hundred donors, and the quirkier letters of support are printed. `` As a basic old-age pensioner hardly able to afford a new tire for my 1939 pushbike, I have decided to drink water instead of beer for the rest of July,'' wrote H.J. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, who sent $ 8. An appeal of the libel verdict will be heard on Oct. 3. If the award is reduced, <PERSON> Hislop </PERSON> says the donations will go to families of <PERSON> Sutcliffe </PERSON>'s victims. According to <PERSON> Loynes </PERSON>, readers who went through the British private school network provide the magazine with high-ranking contacts in business, politics and the bureaucracy. Journalists of the establishment media also use Private Eye to publish stories their own papers wo n't touch, he said in an interview, because `` Private Eye is prepared to take the risk to be irresponsible.'' Managing director <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Cash </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> in May that the magazine's profits were just $ 4,800 last year after making provisions for libel damages and costs of about $ 800,000. Seventy percent of Private Eye shares are owned by comedian <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, with smaller stakes owned by Cash and founder <PERSON> Ingrams </PERSON>, who used to list his recreation in `` Who's Who'' as `` litigation.'' <PERSON> Hislop </PERSON> succeeded <PERSON> Ingrams </PERSON> in 1986, long after the <PERSON> Sutcliffe </PERSON> item appeared. Ironically, when <PERSON> Hislop </PERSON> took over one of his promises was to reduce the number of libel suits draining Private Eye's coffers.

 The operator of a boarding home where an 87-year-old resident was mistaken for dead and nearly embalmed has been charged with three counts of operating an unlicensed nursing home. The charges filed against <PERSON> Robbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Caldwell </PERSON> are minor misdemeanors and carry a maximum fine of $ 100, City Prosecutor <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said Thursday. A resident of the boarding home, <PERSON> Carrie </PERSON> <PERSON> Stringfellow </PERSON>, apparently lost consciousness Aug. 5 and was mistaken for dead. She was transported to a funeral home, where her murmurings startled a mortician who was preparing to embalm her. Ms. <PERSON> Stringfellow </PERSON>, who is blind, was taken to Mercy Medical Center. She was released from the hospital Wednesday and transferred to a nursing home. Doctors said she apparently remembers nothing of the events at the funeral home.

<HEAD>The Korean Airliner Disaster, Anglo-American Style</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The 1983 <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> disaster is returning to television in an Anglo-American docudrama focusing on behind-the-scenes political intrigue. `` Tailspin: Behind the Korean Airliner Tragedy'' recreates the American political response to the Soviet downing on Aug. 31, 1983 of <ORGANIZATION> KAL </ORGANIZATION> Flight 007 in which 269 people were killed. The 90-minute film stars <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarandon </PERSON> as <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenczowski </PERSON>, then <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> affairs director for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> as <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Burt </PERSON>, then the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s assistant secretary for <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> affairs `` Tailspin'' will be aired Aug. 20 on cable TV's Home Box Office as the first in a three-project partnership between <ORGANIZATION> HBO </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Granada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. The trans-Atlantic line-up includes producer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Smithson </PERSON> and director <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Darlow </PERSON>, who are British, and writer <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON>, an Irishman. Besides <PERSON> Sarandon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, the American cast includes <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> <PERSON> Yulin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Moriarty </PERSON>. In an on-set interview last December in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, producer <PERSON> Smithson </PERSON> called the project `` a serious and intellectual work of the type you do n't often see on American TV.'' In more than 150 hours of interviews with up to 60 people, some claimed the downing was a deliberate, cold-blooded Soviet attack; some that the airliner was on an espionage mission, and some that it was all a tragic blunder. Missing American records fueled allegations of a cover-up. `` Tailspin'' does n't take sides. <PERSON> Smithson </PERSON> said it is interested not in fixing blame but in examining the middle-level, decision-making process in American government. In one scene, <PERSON> Sarandon </PERSON>, as <PERSON> Lenczowski </PERSON>, argues in a White House boardroom about the wording of a speech President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would later deliver. `` We're interested in the political battle in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> at the time between the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION>, the center and the right,'' said <PERSON> Smithson </PERSON>. He said the emergence of a Soviet policy of glasnost, or openness, made `` Tailspin'' a period piece with perceptions of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> as `` the evil empire'' soon to be outmoded. `` This is a curious piece of modern history, an entirely pre-glasnost piece,'' said <PERSON> Smithson </PERSON>. `` It marks a turning-point where we're beginning to see the softening of <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>.'' Director <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Darlow </PERSON> said he intended the film to be `` an international political thriller.'' `` If we've succeeded, it will have a sort of ` All the President's Men' feel about it,'' said the director, referring to <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Pakula </PERSON>'s acclaimed 1976 film about the Watergate In telling its story from the inside, <PERSON> Darlow </PERSON> distinguished his film from `` Shootdown,'' the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> TV-movie with <PERSON> Angela </PERSON> <PERSON> Lansbury </PERSON> that aired last Nov. 28. That version examined the crises of the outsiders _ families of the victims and others. `` Tailspin'' focuses, he said, on three groups: the hard-line anti-Soviets, represented by <PERSON> Lenczowski </PERSON>; the middle ground, represented by the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>; and <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials who, <PERSON> Darlow </PERSON> said, saw the incident as `` a gigantic screw-up by the Soviets.'' <PERSON> Sarandon </PERSON>, a 1975 Academy Award nominee for `` Dog Day Afternoon,'' came to the project directly from filming in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. He had no time to meet the real <PERSON> Lenczowski </PERSON>, now a strategic studies consultant at the Council for Inter-American Security in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. But he thinks attitudes to the KAL tragedy have changed following the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> downing of a civilian Iranian airliner in July, 1988. `` Since that was, as our government says, accidental, I think Americans will be more open-minded over the shooting down of the Korean airliner,'' <PERSON> Sarandon </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bridget </PERSON> <PERSON> Potter </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> HBO </ORGANIZATION>'s Senior Vice-President for Original Programming, agreed, saying the later incident means the earlier one `` can not be seen in isolation.'' `` It can happen again,'' she said. `` Mistakes are going to be made.'' <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> said the HBO-Granada partnership had resulted in a truly international style of TV that works for both British and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> audiences.

<HEAD>Fraternity Eliminates Pledge Period, Spending on Alcohol</HEAD>

 `` Animal House'' is out and temperance in at <LOCATION> Zeta </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beta </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tau </LOCATION>. The national fraternity next month becomes the first to eliminate the traditional pledge period, that rugged rite of passage when hazing can break both spirits and bones. ZBT, like others, also is cutting off fraternity spending on alcohol. `` It's not easy to implement, it may be painful, but nevertheless it's an idea which we felt should be followed through,'' said <ORGANIZATION> ZBT </ORGANIZATION> executive director <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Greer </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, one of the movers behind the decision. The rules are aimed at breaking the image of the stereotypical fraternity house _ <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Belushi-like </PERSON> lunacy, heavy drinking, random abuse of pledges _ while keeping positive aspects such as bonding and community service, <PERSON> Greer </PERSON> said Thursday. <ORGANIZATION> Zeta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tau </ORGANIZATION>, which has 5,000 active members at more than 100 chapters in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, is the first national fraternity to put an end to pledging. A dozen other national fraternities are considering similar plans, said <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Brant </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interfraternity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's critical to eliminate hazing, and this is a viable option,'' said <PERSON> Brant </PERSON>, whose group includes 59 national fraternities. `` We are supporting them, and hope through their success others will learn the right lessons.'' Potential ZBT members will be initiated as brothers within 72 hours of receiving their invitation to join, said <PERSON> Greer </PERSON>. Once in, there will be a combination of orientation and education for the new members rather than a torturous pledge period capped by `` Hell Night.'' `` We've had, as have other organizations, a continuation of hazing incidents _ none life-threatening or severe, but we worry about it,'' said <PERSON> Greer </PERSON>. `` We wanted to take the bull by the horns.'' <PERSON> Greer </PERSON> said no single incident prompted the decision, but several highly publicized incidents involving other fraternities have focused attention on the organizations and hazing in the past two years: _ A <ORGANIZATION> Rutgers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> pledge died of alcohol poisoning after a fraternity house party last year. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Callahan </PERSON>, 18, had a blood alcohol level of 0.43 _ more than four times the legal limit. _ A pledge at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lowell </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> was stuffed in a sleeping bag while fraternity members turned on heaters nearby. The pledge survived, but arrived at the hospital with a body temperature of 109 degrees. _ A <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> pledge charged in a lawsuit that a corrosive oven cleaner was dumped on his head during `` Hell Night'' activities. `` The national fraternities do n't like being identified as the root cause of problems,'' said <PERSON> Greer </PERSON>. `` We have to find some answers and remain on the cutting edge of solving problems.'' While ZBT's Supreme Council unanimously approved the new policy, <PERSON> Greer </PERSON> acknowledges response from its members _ both active and alumni _ has not been uniformly positive. `` In the beginning, there was a lot of shock and denial and anger that the national fraternity would do this,'' said <PERSON> Greer </PERSON>, a Class of'64 ZBT at <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> at Long Branch. `` We've had letters and phone calls from alumni, calling this a break with tradition, saying they do n't understand what we're doing. But overall, it's been far more positive than negative.'' <PERSON> Greer </PERSON> said his organization knew it was risking a possible fall-off in membership and dues this year, but was confident its decision would quickly turn into a recruiting advantage for ZBT. `` We're dealing with a smarter, more savvy freshman. His parents read the papers, they know what's going on with fraternities,'' said <PERSON> Greer </PERSON>. `` Once we get past the initial anxiety, it'll be to our advantage.''

<HEAD>Fire Kitchen Cooks Savor Their Work</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 They do n't see the firefighters they cook for, but the women of the <ORGANIZATION> Salmon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> fire kitchen fuss over every meal as if their favorite children were coming to dinner. During fire season, two crews of local women work round the clock. Housed in the basement of the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management-Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> warehouse, the 20-by-30-foot kitchen can prepare meals for 700, and the cooks have pushed the limit to more than 1,000 when firefighters on lines in other parts of the state are still waiting for their caterers to arrive. They cook in five - and ten-gallon pots and stir their concoctions with ax handles The meals are airlifted to the fire camps. Retired cook <PERSON> Evelyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Yakovac </PERSON> was on hand when the fire kitchen opened more than 40 years ago. It was before the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> used helicopters, so meals were packed in five-gallon tins and parachuted into the camps. Mrs. <PERSON> Yakovac </PERSON> recalls one fire in which the T-bone steaks they sent got hung up in a tree and spoiled before the crews could get them down. The advent of helicopters and pickups helped improve things, she said. It even meant they could send pies to the crews. After the Corn Creek fire in 1961, Mrs. <PERSON> Yakovac </PERSON> went home and built enough pie boxes to feed 180 people. They've been sending out pies ever since. <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> regulations now require a caterer for a fire camp of more than 250, but the fire kitchen still finds itself busy, serving smaller camps and picking up the caterers' slack. `` We do everything homemade here, everything from scratch,'' said <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> Perry </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Yakovac </PERSON>'s daughter and a 34-year veteran who serves as head cook for the five-person daytime crew. Their menus include such entrees as steak, chops, chicken, and casseroles, plus a variety of salads and baked goods. A meal of stew and fruit salad for 700 requires 100 gallons of stew, 50 gallons of fruit salad, 90 gallons of coffee, 70 gallons of punch, and 18 gallons of milk. The women turn out meals for less than $ 10 a day for each firefighter, <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Eileen </PERSON> <PERSON> Havens </PERSON> said. In contrast, the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> this year paid caterers more than $ 28 a day for each firefighter's meals.

<HEAD>NTSB Looking Into Possibility That Cracks Triggered Engine Breakup</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The investigation of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> DC-10 crash in <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, is looking into whether the engine breakup may have been triggered by cracks in its fan assembly, officials say. However, no direct evidence of cracking has been found, officials said Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> disclosed that a routine inspection of a <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> CF6-6 engine on another <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> DC-10 at <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s maintenance facility in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> recently uncovered a number of small cracks on a flange component of the fan assembly. The safety board cited the discovery in a letter to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> in which it urged the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> to begin a special investigation to determine how much stress the GE engine can withstand before such components show signs of a problem, including cracking. The board, however, made no recommendations that would immediately affect the operation of any of the DC-10s being flown with the CF6-6 engines. There are 124 DC-10s with that engine being flown by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines, most belonging to <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> Flight 232 crashed July 19 as it tried to make an emergency landing at the <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, airport, killing 111 of the 296 people on board. The plane's No. 2 engine, located at the center tail section, broke apart during flight. The breakup, in which much of the fan rotor assembly separated, destroyed the jetliner's hydraulic control system. The safety board emphasized that critical parts of the engine, including front portions of the fan assembly where the cracking was found in the engine in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, have not been found and are presumed scattered across the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> countryside. Nevertheless, the board said it was concerned that cracks similar to those found in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> may have developed in other CF6-6 engines. If such cracks were allowed to progress to the point that the fan flange were to fail, the agency said it could `` cause catastrophic release of the -LRB- engine -RRB- fan section'' such as apparently occurred aboard Flight 232. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Broderick </PERSON>, acting <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> executive director, said in a telephone interview that the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> is aware of the cracks found in the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> engine in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. However, he disputed the theory that the cracks might be related to the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> crash. `` They were not cracks related to stress ... or strain on parts. ... They are completely unrelated to the events in <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>,'' he said, adding that the cracks appeared to have been caused by `` a chemical corrosion process'' rather than metal fatigue. But <PERSON> Broderick </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> agreed with the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> recommendations and that a review of CF6-6 engine performance was under way. The <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> said the investigation of the CF6-6 engine should include `` close scrutiny of the design, certification, manufacture, inspection and maintenance of the fan section of the engine.'' It also should include various tests to determine the `` life limits'' of engine fan components so that inspection frequencies can be established for those engine parts, the agency said.

 Men are more likely than women to think about sex while bicycling, and women are more likely than men to think about cycling during sex, according to cyclists who told a magazine the sport generally improves their sex lives. Sixty-six percent of the 1,675 respondents to a mail-in survey by Bicycling magazine said they believed cycling has made them better lovers, and 44 percent said it increased their sex drive, while 11 percent said it decreased. `` All this time you were logging your miles, this little sport was becoming the hottest thing since naked volleyball,'' the magazine said in its September issue, due on newsstands next week. Asked whether they thought about sex while cycling, 1,146 men, or 85 percent, said they did, while 234 women, or 77 percent, acknowledged such thoughts. Asked whether they thought about cycling during sex, 19 percent of the men and 23 percent of the women said they did.

<HEAD>Death and Taxes _ Or is it Death of Tuxes?</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> said nothing is certain but death and taxes. To the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> nothing is as certain either as the death of tuxes. The Department's Depreciation Analysis Division has issued what is probably the first federal tuxedo study. It is contained in 54 pages, complete with tables, three appendices, graphs and a bibliography. `` There are two major types of tuxedos: basic black tuxedos and fashion tuxedos,'' the analysts inform us. `` Basic black tuxedos generally do not change in style, while fashion tuxedos generally change in style from year to year,'' says the Depreciation Analysis Division, a newcomer on the governmental scene. `` The basic black tuxedo ceases to rent either because it is worn out as a result of the multiple process of wearing and cleaning. ... Fashion tuxedos are also susceptible to sudden unrepairable damage, but usually go out of style or become obsolete before they physically wear out.'' The study was done to help determine the rate at which rental establishments should depreciate their tuxedos for tax purposes. To the tax man, depreciation is the process in which the owner of property is allowed to deduct the yearly decrease in the value of that property. According to the report, no matter how long a tuxedo may hang on a rack in the back room, its economic life is only as long as customers want to rent it. `` The principal findings of this study are that the equivalent economic life of tuxedos held for rental is 1.9 years, while their useful life, which measures the period of which they provide service, is 3.7 years,'' the report says. `` If <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> were to establish a separate asset class for tuxedos, <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> would suggest that a 2.0 year life be assigned to such class.'' The department chose August for its report, perhaps to prove that some government is around _ what with the president in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> scattered to the four winds and bureaucrats at the beach. `` The basic unit of input is the tuxedo jacket,'' says the section on characteristics of the formal wear industry. `` The average rental includes the jacket, pants, cummerbund, shirt, tie, and studs. ... Since pants usually wear out faster than jackets, approximately one and a third pairs of pants are purchased for each jacket.'' The study notes that a set of tuxedos in a single style `` typically contains tuxedos in a wide range of sizes, some of which may rent very frequently and others of which may rent hardly at all.'' `` The latter are nevertheless needed, because rentals are often made to entire wedding parties and it is necessary to fit the entire party in order to rent even a single tuxedo.'' Under the heading `` useful life of tuxedos,'' the report to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> spells out the rental patterns reported for 199 styles of tuxes. `` Most styles, 182 out of 199, had a useful life of approximately three to five years,'' said the statisticians. They found that formal wear rental companies infrequently sell used tuxedos. `` Industry representatives noted that before used tuxedos are discarded, they may be spray painted, shredded, or their sleeves may be cut off to prevent the tuxedos from being worn when their appearance would no longer suggest elegance,'' the report says. `` There is thus little or no salvage value for retired tuxedos.'' The tuxedo report is the first depreciation report issued by the Depreciation Analysis Division. There is no mention of what the second study might be.

<HEAD>Outlook Good for Poultry, Livestock Production</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Most livestock and poultry producers appear to have outdistanced the impact of last year's drought and rising feed costs, according to <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> economists. `` Prospects remain positive for continued expansion of red meat and poultry production as more favorable weather ... caused crop and forage conditions to improve in most areas,'' the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday Looking ahead, the report said that total output of red meat and poultry in 1990 is expected to increase 2 percent to 3 percent from this year's record level, continuing the pace that began in 1982. `` Sharpest year-to-year increase will occur in the broiler and <LOCATION> turkey </LOCATION> sectors, but fed beef production -LRB- from feedlots -RRB- also may rise. Non-fed beef output probably will decline as herd expansion accelerates, and pork production may slip about 1 percent after increasing since 1986.'' A rebound in crop production from last year's drought-shriveled output `` is expected to result in lower feed costs'' as corn and soybean prices drop below the levels of a year ago. `` Continued expansion in meat exports will soften price impacts of record production,'' the report said. `` However, rising per capita meat consumption in 1990, together with a slowing economy and a lower rate of increase in consumer real incomes, should result in only modest increase in red meat prices and declining poultry prices.'' Analysts said consumer prices of beef and pork may increase 1 percent to 3 percent next year. But because of sharp production increases, retail prices of broilers may drop 8 percent to 20 percent, and turkey prices may decline 3 percent to 5 percent from 1989 averages. Improved returns for egg producers and prospects for lower feed costs are expected to boost 1990 egg output 1 percent to 2 percent, the report said. As a result, retail egg prices may decline 10 percent to 15 percent. Per capita egg consumption could rise for the first time since 1979. Cattle producers indicated July 1 that herd expansion is continuing, although slowed by drought in some areas. Beef cow inventories were up marginally for the second consecutive year, and producers were holding 4 percent more beef replacement heifers for possible expansion in 1990, according to the July 1 figures. `` Current inventory estimates indicate that as feed prices decline, feeder cattle supplies will be adequate to allow an accelerated pace of herd expansion and increased fed cattle marketings in 1990,'' the report said. In a related report Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> said the number of cattle being fed for the slaughter market as of Aug. 1 in the seven major beef states totaled 6.57 million head, down 4 percent from a year ago and 2 percent below the level of two years ago. Marketings of fed cattle in July totaled 1.69 million head, down 4 percent from a year ago and 1 percent below two years ago. But the placement of new cattle and calves in fattening pens last month was reported at 1.31 million head, up 5 percent from a year ago and 3 percent more than two years ago. As of Aug. 1, feedlot inventories were smaller than a year earlier in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Only <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> feedlots showed increases, while those in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> were reported unchanged. State feedlot cattle inventories are listed here for the seven states, which account for about three-fourths of the nation's beef. The first number is the number of cattle, in thousands, as of Aug. 1, and the second number is the percentage of a year earlier.

Last year's sales totaled 8.3 million tons, making <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> the leading foreign market for American wheat farmers. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels of wheat or 39.4 bushels of corn. The 100,000 tons of wheat would be about 3.67 million bushels, and the 150,000 tons of corn would be about 5.91 million bushels. Wheat prices at the farm have averaged around $ 3.73 per bushel nationally, according to <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> recent five-day market estimates. That would make the sale worth about $ 14 million. Corn prices at about $ 2.26 per bushel would make the corn sale worth about $ 13.4 million.

<HEAD>Checking Up on Doctors: Consumers Find Credentials Hard to Verify</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE DREYFOUS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Consumers looking for a reputable physician often turn to the Yellow Pages, but researchers say verifying the credentials advertised can be all but impossible. Confirming a doctor's education, specialty training, certification and other background is frequently beyond the average citizen's grasp, according to an article published Thursday in The New England Journal of Medicine. `` It's very difficult in most communities in this country for patients to get important facts about physicians they'd like to consult,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Relman </PERSON>, the journal's editor in chief. The problem is that no straightforward directory is available to the public and those who consult professional listings often find them indecipherable. `` While trying to ascertain how physicians' credentials corresponded to those they listed ... we encountered a veritable obstacle course of inconsistent and illogical policies that effectively deny information to the consumer,'' wrote Drs. <PERSON> Julia </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reade </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ratzan </PERSON>, who conducted the informal survey. `` In conclusion, obtaining access to complete, up-to-date, and verified information about physicians is all but impossible.'' Like many consumers, <PERSON> Reade </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ratzan </PERSON> started their research by thumbing through the Yellow Pages. They found <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s listings were not routinely corroborated and included a warning suggesting additional consultation with a local medical association. The <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION> -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which receives about 20,000 similar inquiries annually, answered many of the researchers' questions. But the process is rarely that simple, they reported. `` Many medical associations are too small, or are unwilling, to commit the time and manpower needed to provide rigorous verification, and they accept at face value whatever information the physician supplies,'' according to the researchers. <PERSON> Reade </PERSON> is a psychiatrist at <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Ratzan </PERSON> an associate professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>. Because physicians supply much of their own background information, <PERSON> Relman </PERSON> said, patients may face medical fraud. Doctors who need periodic re-certification in their specialities may skip the exams or, if they fail to pass, not report the results, he said. To protect consumers `` organized medicine must ... take the initiative and see that standardized directories about physicians be provided and readily accessible to the public,'' said <PERSON> Relman </PERSON>, who for more than a decade has pushed for an accessible consumer directory. `` If I were sick and needed an operation I would want to know a lot about the surgeon who was going to operate on me,'' <PERSON> Relman </PERSON> said. `` But if you're a lay person and do n't have access to professional sources of information it's rather difficult.'' Tenacious consumers can track down the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>'s directory, but the guide uses complicated numerical and letter codes in verifying information about a physician's year and state of licensure, medical school and specialty-board certification. Beyond that, no information is provided on advanced training. `` Thus, there is no way to distinguish between the self-styled cardiologist with board certification in internal medicine alone and the cardiologist who has board certification in that sub-specialty,'' the doctors said. The researchers studied several other compendiums, including how-to manuals spawned in the 1970s by the consumer movement, but found similar gaps and obstacles in each case. State licensing boards agreed that the best way to remedy patients' confusion would be to establish a carefully verified directory, <PERSON> Reade </PERSON> and <PERSON> Razan </PERSON> reported.

 Federal investigators are trying to determine how defense contractors supposedly obtained secret budget documents containing details on the military's spending plans for weapons. Although the inquiry has centered so far on the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a major defense contractor, it is expected to extend to other defense contractors, government officials familiar with the case said Thursday. The investigation is being run by the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> inspector general's office and is separate from the 3-year-old `` Ill Wind'' investigation of bribery and influence-peddling in the awarding of <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> contracts. The `` Ill Wind'' investigation conducted by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> focused on the role of private consultants in obtaining inside information about <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> contracts. The separate <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> case became public Tuesday when <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> official, was indicted by a federal grand jury in suburban <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, on 39 counts of theft, conspiracy and fraud. The charges stem from his alleged trafficking in classified documents, according to the indictment. `` It's part of a continuing investigation by the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> inspector general's office into how certain contractors and their employees have illegally trafficked in classified documents,'' said one <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> official, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` How <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON> obtained these documents is the subject of further investigation.'' According to the 68-page indictment, <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON>, while he worked for <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> as a senior marketing analyst from 1978 to 1986, obtained hundreds of the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s most sensitive documents. Among those papers were <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> directives on budget proposals, along with the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s five-year plan, according to the indictment. The five-year plan is closely held within the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> because it is the chief defense spending blueprint used by the secretary of <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION> and civilian service leaders in making major budget decisions about weapons. In addition, <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON> received three <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> decision directives signed by former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, the indictment charged. Distribution of those documents is extremely limited. The three documents dealt with the Strategic Defense Initiative, a proposed shield against nuclear attack, the indictment said, but it did not give more details. Although <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON> had a high-level security clearance, he did n't have authorized access to those papers, the indictment said <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON> refused to discuss the case. Contacted by telephone at his suburban <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> home, he said only, `` I do not wish to comment whatsoever on any of this.'' <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON> was fired by <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> in September 1986, said <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Carr </PERSON>, a spokesman for the company in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. The Wall Street Journal said the firing was because investigators were looking at <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON>'s activities <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> is cooperating with the investigators. `` There has been a considerable number of requests for documents, papers, records and so on,'' he said. `` We have provided those and will continue to answer requests for them.'' After obtaining the papers, <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON> passed them along to <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> officials and other, unnamed contractors, the indictment said. He also allegedly obtained some documents that had been specifically requested by <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> officials. None of the other people under investigation are identified, although the indictment said some of other alleged conspirators created separate log books to keep <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials from knowing that <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> had the unauthorized classified documents. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> has authority to handle certain classified documents because it is a major defense contractor.

<HEAD>Navy Evaluating Latest Trident 2 Test Failure</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The latest test failure of the Trident 2 missile is n't expected to affect plans to put the submarine-launched weapon to sea next year, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> says. However, the admiral in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s newest and reportedly most deadly weapon says he'll delay deployment if he has to. A Trident 2 missile exploded Tuesday, seconds after being launched from the nuclear submarine <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> about 200 miles off the coast of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. It was the second such failure in three undersea test firings. The three-stage Trident 2 is a more lethal version of the Trident 1, the heart of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s nuclear deterrent. The new version, built by the <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Missiles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, is almost twice as heavy as its predecessor. The Trident 2, each of which costs $ 26.5 million, is to be deployed in the 1990s aboard a new generation of submarines, providing the sea-based leg of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s land, sea and air nuclear forces. Until the test failures, the missile had been one of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s nuclear modernization programs to be mostly problem-free, with 16 of 19 successful land launchings. In a statement released Thursday at the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said that despite the latest test failure `` no impact is presently foreseen on the planned deployment of the USS Tennessee in early 1990.'' The <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> is to be the first of nine submarines equipped to carry 24 of the missiles. The statement said that problems with water pressures on the missile appear to have caused electrical cables in the first-stage motor to sever, triggering the missile's self-destruct order. Rear Adm. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Malley </PERSON> said in an interview published Thursday in the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> that he's confident problems with the missile will be resolved by the March 31 target date for deployment. `` If I have to slip the date again, I'll slip it again,'' said <PERSON> Malley </PERSON>, who earlier delayed the target date by three months. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday that <PERSON> Malley </PERSON> was not available for an interview, but it did confirm that his statements to the Times were accurate. <PERSON> Malley </PERSON> told the newspaper that initial reports from Tuesday's failed test indicated that engineers, despite computer simulations, seriously underestimated the amount of pressure on the Trident The missile, he said, `` is much larger than anything we've fired before. ... We expected some extra pressure on the rear end of the missile and its rocket nozzles, but not as much as we're seeing. It turns out that the pressure and the aft load are much more severe than was anticipated.'' Asked if the failures were a result of a design error or a flaw in the manufacturing, <PERSON> Malley </PERSON> said: `` The device was built to specification. There is no question that it was designed the way it was intended to be designed.'' In a statement, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said the submarine will undergo a two-month `` shakedown'' at the Electric Boat docks in <LOCATION> Groton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>. During that time, `` evaluation and correction action for the test failure will be conducted.

 Depression robs people of the ability to function more often than arthritis, ulcers, diabetes or high blood pressure, according to researchers who say depression is taken much too lightly. `` We've greatly underestimated up until now how disabling depression is related to other chronic medical conditions,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ware </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, principal investigator in a study that questioned 11,242 outpatients in three cities. Depression proved at least as bad as emphysema or back problems at limiting people in their physical functioning or causing them to stay in bed, said the study, published in today's Journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The only two worse chronic conditions were heart pain and advanced coronary artery disease, in terms of limiting activities such as walking, dressing, bathing, climbing stairs or participating in sports, the study found. `` The findings are very important,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keller </PERSON>, a depression researcher and director of psychiatric research at <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. Four percent of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> population, or 9.9 million people, suffer from major depression at some point in any given year, he said. Millions more may have some depressive symptoms and may be `` highly treatable'' with anti-depressant medications, said Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Zajecka </PERSON>, clinical director of psychiatric treatment research at Rush-Presbyterian-St. <PERSON> Luke </PERSON>'s Medical Center in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> Depressed people sometimes give up jobs and lose spouses while bouncing from doctor to doctor for years before being correctly diagnosed and effectively treated, he said. Dr. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerman </PERSON>, a depression researcher and psychiatry professor at <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, estimated that only about 20 percent of depressives are getting treated. `` The majority suffer in silence or are misdiagnosed _ as having tension, anxiety, personality disorder or weak character,'' he said. The study, coordinated by the <ORGANIZATION> RAND </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, looked at adult patients in a variety of settings _ health maintenance organizations, group medical practices and solo practices _ in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. About half of the subjects studied suffered from either depressive symptoms or one of eight chronic medical conditions _ high blood pressure, diabetes, advanced coronary heart disease, heart pain, arthritis, back problems, lung problems or digestive problems. More than one-fifth of the subjects _ a total of 2,467 people _ reported depressive symptoms, which they typically explained to their doctors as feeling `` down in the dumps'' or chronically tired, <PERSON> Ware </PERSON> said. Such patients experienced as much or more bodily pain and stayed in bed as many or more days as patients with back, lung or digestive problems, heart pain, high blood pressure or diabetes, the researchers found. Only arthritis proved more painful and only advanced heart disease caused more bed days, they said. In addition, patients with depressive symptoms reported significantly less ability to function socially than those with any of the chronic medical conditions, the researchers said. `` If the doctor ... is unable to come up with a certified psychiatric diagosis, that does n't mean the person can be ignored,'' said <PERSON> Ware </PERSON>, a research psychologist and senior scientist at <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospitals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. Such patients `` have a tremendous unmet need and burden that costs a lot from society's point of view, because they're not able to function,'' he said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is being sued by two environmental groups that say the company should pay the full cost of repairing environmental damage caused by the <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> oil spill in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> The suit, filed Thursday in state <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>, charges that <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> was negligent in failing to prevent the March 24 spill. It also contends that <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> and its six partners in the <ORGANIZATION> Alyeska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pipeline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which runs the trans-Alaska oil pipeline, fraudulently misrepresented their ability to prevent or control a major spill. `` This lawsuit simply seeks to force those who caused the unprecedented assault on the environment to pay to restore one of the world's last reservoirs of natural beauty to its original, unspoiled state,'' said the complaint by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Newsome </PERSON>, the wildlife federation's vice president for resources conservation, told a news conference the suit `` complements and reinforces'' one filed Tuesday by <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> seeking to recover unspecified damages for losses from the spill. The suit by the environmental groups says <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> should be forced to finance a court-controlled fund to cover the cost of assessing and repairing environmental damage in areas affected by the spill. The money, which Ms. <PERSON> Newsome </PERSON> said would amount to `` billions,'' also would be used to buy natural resources such as fish and wildlife to compensate for ecological damage that can not be repaired. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said the company would not comment on the suit until it had seen it. The suit says <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> should pay for the establishment of an independent group of scientists appointed by the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> court to control and monitor the environmental restoration effort. The suit names each member of the <ORGANIZATION> Alyeska </ORGANIZATION> pipeline consortium: <ORGANIZATION> Amerada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hess </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pipeline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Arco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pipe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> BP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pipelines </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> -RRB- </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pipeline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pipeline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Phillips </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pipeline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pipeline </ORGANIZATION> The consortium was responsible for the initial response to the spill.

 <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> was executed in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>'s electric chair early Friday for the 1977 pipe-bomb killing of an 11-year-old girl. <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> was pronounced dead at 12:14 a.m. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> refused Thursday to intervene in the case after the 11th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> upheld a lower court's decision to reject a stay of execution. Gov. <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> earlier refused to grant clemency for <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, who was married last week in a prison ceremony. <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, 43, was condemned to die in the electric chair at Holman Prison for the murder of <PERSON> Rena </PERSON> <PERSON> Mae </PERSON> <PERSON> Callins </PERSON>, whose body was blown apart on the porch of her home when she picked up a pipe-bomb and it detonated. <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> contended the device was not meant to explode, only to scare the girl's family. The girl's aunt had broken off a relationship with him shortly before the pipe-bomb was planted. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Varner </PERSON> of <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>, who rejected <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>'s motion for a stay, said it is `` beyond the bounds of reason ... to believe that a device which maimed and killed an 11-year-old child by exploding in her hands could be thought of ... as not presenting a serious risk of harm.'' `` I ca n't rest until he gets the chair,'' said <PERSON> Margie </PERSON> <PERSON> Callins </PERSON>, the girl's mother. In <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Lucia </PERSON> <PERSON> Penland </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> Prison Project said <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> `` was what most of us would call an all-around American boy with a bright future before he went to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>.'' She also said, `` The terrible tragedy of Mrs. <PERSON> Callins </PERSON> and her family can not be understated.'' Courts in recent weeks have rejected defense claims that <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> wrongly was denied a state-funded psychologist to show that he possibly was suffering post-traumatic stress disorder stemming from his Vietnam War experiences. <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> was married Aug. 9 at <LOCATION> Holman </LOCATION>, prison system spokeswoman <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> said. `` They let him out of the cell to go into the visiting room and she -LRB- the bride -RRB- was there along with some other guests and after the prison chaplain married them, they had some cake and then he returned to his cell,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> said. The governor's press secretary, <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbott </PERSON>, said that according to the clemency plea, <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Katie </PERSON>, met 3 -LCB- years ago. `` He wrote a letter to her church, saying he listened to their broadcast and she started visiting,'' <PERSON> Abbott </PERSON> said.

 Former Marine Sgt. <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Lonetree </PERSON>, who was court-martialed in the sex-for-secrets scandal at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, wants a federal court to pull copies of a book about his case from stores and halt further publication.

 For the third time this year, scientists discovered an asteroid will fly relatively close to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, and while there is no threat of collision, experts say such a disaster is likely sometime in the future. `` While the new asteroid poses no immediate danger, in astronomical terms it will be making a very close pass'' when it comes within 2 -LCB- million miles of <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> about 8 p.m. PDT next Thursday night, said planetary scientist <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Helin </PERSON>, who discovered the mile-wide hunk of rock. At 2 -LCB- million miles _ about 10 times the distance between the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> moon </LOCATION> _ the asteroid designated 1989 PB `` will be one of the very closest larger objects to pass the Earth this century,'' said <PERSON> Helin </PERSON>, a planetary scientist at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION>. `` It's not going to hit us. Certainly there's no danger,'' astronomer <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Marsden </PERSON> said by telephone from <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, where he directs the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Astronomical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Astronomical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegrams </ORGANIZATION>, an astronomy reporting agency. `` One does n't want to worry people, but anything that's crossing the orbit of the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> stands a chance of hitting the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, but it's much more likely to be later than sooner. I'm talking millions of years,'' <PERSON> Marsden </PERSON> said Thursday. In March, asteroid 1989 FC _ no more than a half-mile in diameter _ passed within a half million miles of <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, but was n't discovered by astronomers until April. In June, a 2-mile-wide asteroid passed about 8 million miles from <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. Scientists have said that if 1989 <ORGANIZATION> FC </ORGANIZATION> had hit <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, it would have done so with the power of about 40 billion tons of <ORGANIZATION> TNT </ORGANIZATION>, or about 40,000 hydrogen bombs, enough to wipe out entire cities. Asteroid 1989 PB is about twice as large. <PERSON> Helin </PERSON> said the discovery of asteroids passing near <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> is ominous because `` if we are finding two or three a year this close to the Earth ... there is strong evidence of a sizable population of these objects that can be devastating. It's the one we do n't see that's going to kill us.'' She discovered asteroid 1989 PB on Aug. 9 in film taken on the 18-inch <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> telescope at <ORGANIZATION> Palomar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observatory </ORGANIZATION> northeast of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. Astronomers were quickly notified, but it was n't until Thursday that word of the discovery was made public by the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pasadena-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, which helps finance searches for near-Earth asteroids. `` We feel comfortable with the very low probability of any serious impact during our lifetime, but there always remains that slight possibility,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Staehle </PERSON>, foundation president. <PERSON> Staehle </PERSON> said that in 30 to 50 years, humans may be able to land spacecraft on any asteroid heading toward <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and `` either put some sort of explosives on it or perhaps deflect it using a solar sail or some other propulsion technique.'' Craters around the globe provide little doubt that asteroids smacked into Earth in prehistoric times. Scientists have blamed a comet exploding in <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>'s atmosphere for a 1908 blast in <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> that devastated miles of uninhabited terrain and was heard thousands of miles away. In recent years, many scientists have become convinced that asteroids striking Earth caused some mass extinctions, including the demise of the dinosaurs 66 million years ago. Other scientists, however, blame extinctions on gradual climate change or massive volcanic eruptions. <PERSON> Marsden </PERSON> said amateur astronomers may be able to see asteroid 1989 PB through telescopes by looking in the constellation Cassiopeia at the time of its closest approach to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. The asteroid moves around the sun in an elliptical orbit that ranges from inside of <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>' orbit to a bit outside Mars' orbit, he said.

 AIDS has reached the 100,000-case milestone in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> less than two years after the deadly disease hit 50,000. The national <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> said that, through July, 102,621 cases of acquired immune deficiency syndrome have been reported in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. A total of 59,391, or 58 percent, of those patients have already died. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> health officials estimate that between 1 million and 1.5 million Americans are infected with HIV, or human immunodeficiency virus, the virus which causes AIDS. A study among homosexual or bisexual males _ the largest risk group for AIDS _ suggests that up to 99 percent of those infected will eventually develop the disease. As scientists have noted for years, since the disease was discovered in 1981, the case count is growing at a faster pace with the spread of the disease. Where the first 50,000 AIDS cases in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> were reported between 1981 and late 1987, the next 50,000 were reported in less than two years _ between December 1987 and July 1989. AIDS continues to occur increasingly among abusers of injectable drugs. In the first six months of 1989, 23 percent of reported AIDS patients were female or heterosexual male users of intravenous drugs. The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said that compares with 18 percent among the cases reported before 1985. Meanwhile, 56 percent of the cases reported in the first half of this year were among homosexual or bisexual males, compared with 63 percent before 1985. Gay or bisexual men make up 60 percent of the 102,621 reported AIDS cases. Twenty percent are IV drug abusers, and 7 percent are both. Four percent are blamed on heterosexual contact. AIDS is transmitted through blood or body fluids, chiefly through sex or the sharing of drug needles.

 More than 71,000 Americans a year die from emphysema and bronchitis and similar chronic lung diseases _ the vast majority from smoking _ and the West has the highest death rate, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> health researchers say. The national <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday that 71,099 Americans died of emphysema, bronchitis and similar chronic lung diseases in 1986, the latest year for which complete statistics are available. <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> statisticians used information about the prevalence of smoking and the risks of smoking to project that 82 percent of the lung-disease deaths were attributable to smoking. The highest death rates were across the West, with the exception of <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said the highest rate was in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, with 49 such deaths per 100,000 people in 1986, significantly higher than the national average of 29.5. Other states with the worst lung-disease death rates were <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. The lowest rates were in the upper <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Texas-to-Mississippi </LOCATION> belt and the middle Northeast. And the lowest rate of all was in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, with 16.9 such deaths per 100,000. The higher rates in the West came despite a generally higher prevalence of smokers in the East, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said. But emphysema and bronchitis, like lung cancer, can take decades to attack and kill smokers _ so today's death rates could reflect smoking patterns of many years ago, or even migration by former smokers to the West, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said. `` What happens -LRB- with emphysema and bronchitis -RRB- is as it is with lung cancer _ it's what you did a long time ago that affects your current disease status,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> specialist in lung diseases. The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said the national mortality rate from lung diseases such as bronchitis and emphysema, at 29.5 per 100,000 people, is up 33 percent from 1979, when the rate was about 22 deaths per 100,000. The rate has risen just 15 percent in males over that time but has increased 80 percent in females _ reflective of a later move by women to give up smoking, <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> said. Although smoking by men peaked in the 1950s, smoking by women did n't peak until the mid-1960s. He said their lung disease death rates, therefore, continue to rise, reflecting their smoking habits from three decades ago. `` Women still have rapidly rising rates, and we'll probably see that for another 10 years,'' he said. The lung disease death rate, nonetheless, was 1.8 times as high in men as in women in 1986. It also was 2.8 times higher for whites than for blacks, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said. The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> also used information about smoking prevalence and smoking cessation in each state to project geographic trends in smoking-related deaths due to lung disease. Like the overall death rates, the highest smoking-related rates were again generally found in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, with lower numbers in the East plus <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>.

 Former President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> will serve as a neutral observer when Ethiopian officials and leaders of a rebel group hold preliminary peace talks next month at <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s policy center. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> announced Thursday that the talks between the government of <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Eritrean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> will begin Sept. 7 at the <ORGANIZATION> Carter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. He said the talks, which will last for several days, will lay the groundwork for further negotiations toward ending the civil war in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>. `` In the history of political affairs, the most significant single step is the first meeting,'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said by telephone from his home in Plains. `` One of the things we hope to do is to provide both sides with an understanding of one another that will lead to a complete resolution of the longstanding conflict.'' The Eritreans, who have been fighting with <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> since 1961, want independence, federation with <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> or regional autonomy for their northern province. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> visited <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> during a tour of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> last month and met with <LOCATION> Ethiopian </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Mengistu </PERSON> <PERSON> Haile </PERSON> <PERSON> Mariam </PERSON>, who had announced June 5 that his government was ready to meet with the Eritreans and another rebel group, the <ORGANIZATION> Tigre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, in the presence of an international observer. The former president said at the time that he would act as official mediator if both sides asked. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said Thursday he could not guess how long it might take for a peace accord to be worked out. But he added, `` I would hope not years because the war continues and the suffering continues.'' <PERSON> Dayle </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, a Carter Center fellow who works on conflict resolution, said <ORGANIZATION> Mengistu </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> EPLF </ORGANIZATION> General Secretary <PERSON> Isaias </PERSON> <PERSON> Afwerki </PERSON> would not be among those attending the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> talks. She said the names of the negotiators and the exact size of the negotiating teams would not be made public. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> praised both leaders for planning the talks and said he is `` convinced that each has a sincere commitment to achieving peace for his people and desires a return to economic prosperity for the region.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Tigre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> was not included in the talks because `` the demands or goals of the Tigre movement are quite different from those of the Eritreans,'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said. He said he hoped the Ethiopian government would talk with that rebel group as well. Thursday's announcement said both sides agreed that the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> talks would be announced publicly and that no preconditions would be set by either party. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said the talks will be held under the auspices of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Negotiation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, which is based at the <ORGANIZATION> Carter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> and which offers third-party assistance to reduce world conflicts.

 Sir <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON> is taking up the cudgel again against critics of his multibillion-dollar hostile takeover bid for <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> BAT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, the world's largest tobacco company, and its <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> affiliates. <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON>, in a statement issued from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> on Thursday, labeled criticism by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> unions and <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON> as examples of `` extensive lobbying'' by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tobacco interests. The Anglo-French financier last month launched a $ 21.6 billion bid for the company along with <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> merchant banker <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothschild </PERSON> and Australian investor <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Packer </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Thursday, union officials held a news conference to charge that the takeover would jeopardize the jobs of 55,000 American workers. `` Where his takeovers have been successful, <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON> has dismantled companies, sold off assets, closed down plants and raided pension funds. In each case, workers have paid a heavy price,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>, president of the Bakery, <ORGANIZATION> Confectionery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. Also Thursday, <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON> met with BAT chairman <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheehy </PERSON> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to offer his help in thwarting the takeover. <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON> said he expressed concern about the impact of a takeover on the 1,500 Kentuckians who work for BAT subsidiaries as well as on 100,000 <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> tobacco farmers. BAT's <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> subsidiary, <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, Ky.-based <ORGANIZATION> BATUS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, oversees <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Williamson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which employs more than 5,000 people. <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON>, meanwhile, reiterated earlier statements that among <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies he has acquired, `` there are presently significantly more people employed in the aggregate than prior to the time of the acquisition.'' The cashless offer for BAT by <ORGANIZATION> Hoylake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> would be financed largely through money borrowed against the concern's existing assets, known as a leveraged buyout The group has said it intends to sell the non-tobacco businesses of <ORGANIZATION> BAT </ORGANIZATION>, which also has significant interests in financial services, paper and retailing _ including such <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> holdings as <ORGANIZATION> Saks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fifth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Avenue </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Marshall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Field </ORGANIZATION> department stores and <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. Union officials concede there is no absolute proof a <ORGANIZATION> Goldsmith </ORGANIZATION> takeover would result in layoffs, but <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday that corporate mergers, takeovers and leveraged buyouts have cost more than 90,000 union workers their jobs since 1980. Union officials listed 30 such corporate actions _ including <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON>'s aborted 1986 bid for <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rubber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and his successful takeover of the <LOCATION> James </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> paper company in 1985 _ they say cost thousands their jobs. The list included <ORGANIZATION> BATUS </ORGANIZATION>' closing of the <LOCATION> Gimbels </LOCATION> department store chain, which union officials said cost 5,000 jobs. <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON> said in his statement that the only jobs at risk under his BAT takeover proposal were those held by senior company officials in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. More than 200 members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last week signed a letter urging Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> to express concern to the British government about the multinational leveraged buyout.

 A man was sentenced to life in prison for killing his barber because he was dissatisfied with an $ 8 haircut. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, 34, was found guilty of murder and two counts of menancing Thursday by a <ORGANIZATION> Denver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury. He was convicted in the death of <PERSON> Bobbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Willis </PERSON>, 47, proprietor of <PERSON> Barber </PERSON> <PERSON> Bob </PERSON>'s Barber Shop. `` People do n't kill someone over a haircut in this country,'' Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyatt </PERSON> told <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> before delivering the sentence. `` But I'm convinced that is exactly what you did.'' Hyatt noted <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' two previous felony convictions, one for armed robbery and the other for burglary, and three misdemeanors. `` You must have such an explosive temper that you are literally unable to control it,'' the judge said. Eight witnesses testified they watched <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> angrily confront <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> in the barber shop last Dec. 17. Two of the witnesses, shop employees, said they saw <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> shoot <PERSON> Willis </PERSON>. They said <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> became extremely angry at <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> after he claimed the barber botched his haircut by exposing a scar on the back of <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' head. They said <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> vowed to return to the shop and get even.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> is accusing a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> company of improperly shipping hazardous materials on a passenger jet and says it is seeking a record $ 240,000 in penalties. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday said a shipment of chemicals by <ORGANIZATION> Textile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treatments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Austin </ORGANIZATION> resulted in a cargo-hold fire that forced the pilot to order an emergency evacuation when the plane landed in <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>. Several passengers and flight crew members were injured `` We consider this a very serious incident,'' said <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Leyden </PERSON>. `` This is the largest fine we've ever asked for in a hazardous materials case.'' <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON>, an attorney representing the company, said it would contest the proposed fines. <PERSON> Leyden </PERSON> said the company's options include paying the fine or asking for a hearing before an administrative law judge at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION>. Should the company refuse to pay, government attorneys could file suit in federal court. According to the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>, the Austin firm violated federal rules on both labeling and packaging of hazardous chemicals used for `` stone-washing'' fabric. Included was five gallons of a hydrogen peroxide solution banned from passenger and cargo-only flights.

<NOTE>EPA Accused of Contributing to Air Pollution</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An environmental group has accused the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> of contributing to increased air pollution by promoting the burning of toxic wastes. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Toxics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>, a private organization that focuses on toxic pollution issues, said at a news conference outside the agency's headquarters Thursday that <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s policies will `` encourage more toxic waste production.'' The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement saying the group `` seriously distorts'' the agency's role in the disposal of such wastes. `` The only thing we're prompting is waste reduction,'' said <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Woods </PERSON>. `` We're encouraging -LRB- states -RRB- to consider all waste reduction opportunities. Secondly we're looking at them to look at existing -LRB- disposal -RRB- facilities out of state. And as a last resort build new facilities.'' She said that the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> requires strict emission controls when toxic wastes are burned. The environmental group said the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> does not focus enough in getting companies and industrial plants to invest in technology that would reduce toxic emissions. Instead, the critics maintained, agency policy requires state and local officials to develop new toxic disposal facilities such as additional landfills or incinerators.

 Leaders of an <PERSON> American </PERSON> <PERSON> Indian </PERSON> coalition say they're haunted by the image of their ancestors' remains stored in boxes in museums and universities. They want them returned for burial. `` We're asking that they bring them back to their lands, their natural resting place. That's what they deserve,'' says <PERSON> Delfino </PERSON> <PERSON> Begay </PERSON>, governor of <LOCATION> Laguna </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pueblo </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION>, meeting in <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION> this week, estimates the bones of 2.5 million Indians are held in public and private collections nationwide. Museum spokesmen dispute the figure, estimating institutions hold the remains of 100,000 to 250,000. One of the largest collections is at the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, which says it has 18,600 such remains, stacked in boxes in a hallway closed to the public. The Smithsonian, along with a number of other museums and universities, is studying the bones to learn more about the bone structure, diseases and lifestyles of American Indians of more than a century ago. The Indian leaders, representing about 20 tribes at conference, want the remains returned now, or at the very least, when the studies are completed. Some say they have nightmares about the unburied dead. `` You really do n't get the feeling of the Smithsonian ... until you get there and see the boxes upon boxes in the hallway,'' said <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenmill </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Salish-Kootenay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> from <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mont </PERSON>. `` You get all kinds of feelings put together. You're sad, you're hurt, you're angry You get them all at once when you're looking at it.'' The delegates agreed the situation has improved in the past 10 years, with new laws protecting disposition of newly unearthed remains. Some institutions also have returned bones. Last week, for instance, about 1,200 pounds of prehistoric remains of members of the <LOCATION> Seminole </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tribe </LOCATION> were reburied at Wounded Knee, <LOCATION> S.D. </LOCATION>, after being stored at the University of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> for the past three years. The remains had been unearthed at a construction site near <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>. Their new gravesite will become part of the National Indian Cemetery The <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> also recently returned remains of 16 Blackfeet that were improperly taken from a Blackfeet cemetery, and the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tennessee </ORGANIZATION> repatriated 190 Cherokee remains exhumed in 1967. But the Indian leaders point out the returned remains are a small fraction of what is being held. They are particularly concerned with older bones, including skulls taken for cranial studies by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> during the Civil War and wars with Indians. <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Madeleine </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> said comparative studies are still being done on the skulls. She also said the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> was evaluating its policy of holding onto the remains. `` Our goal is to come to an accommodation with them,'' she said of discussions with Indian groups. `` I think we all feel there is a solution.'' Other large collections are at the Field Museum in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> History </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Researchers say they are reluctant to relinquish the remains because of recent breakthroughs. <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Voris </PERSON>, the Field's vice president of collections and research, said DNA fingerprinting has revealed a wealth of information from the bones. `` It may help find the kinds of illness people were prone to,'' he said. Ms. <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> said researchers have learned that rheumatoid arthritis is more prevalent in Indians than in the general population. And Dr. <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>, curator of archaeology at the McClung Museum in <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tennessee </ORGANIZATION>'s 5,500 remains are now being used for research of spina bifida, a defect characterized by imperfect closure of part of the spine. `` There are so many new things coming out, and who knows what else will come along,'' <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 A $ 65 million Navstar navigation satellite rocketed into orbit early today, a half hour after liftoff from <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION>. A three-stage <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> 2 rocket blazed away from its launch pad at 1:58 a.m. and left a fiery trail in the sky as it sped over the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> and climbed toward space. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> reported 30 minutes after liftoff that the 128-foot-tall rocket had performed flawlessly and had propelled the satellite into an initial elliptical orbit ranging from about 100 to 11,000 miles above the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> 2 has put its payload into a successful orbit,'' said Lt. Col. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Rand </PERSON>, the launch control center commentator. On Sunday, ground controllers will command an on-board motor to fire to shift the satellite into a circular orbit about 11,000 miles up. The $ 30 million Delta rocket carried a Navstar Global Positioning System Satellite, the third in a new series of spacecraft which enable military units such as aircraft, ships, submarines, tanks and field troops to determine their location within 50 feet and in some cases to within 10 feet. The satellites, effective in any kind of weather, also keep track of military units' speed within a fraction of a mile per hour and the precise time within a millionth of a second. Each 3,675-pound Navstar contains an atomic clock with an error rate of one second every 300,000 years. American and allied military users receive information from a coded channel. Civilian users, also with access to the satellite system, would monitor an open channel providing them with less accurate position information within 300 feet. The satellite launched today is the third of 21 upgraded Block 2 <ORGANIZATION> Navstars </ORGANIZATION> that the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> plans to orbit to complete a global system by 1992. The first two were launched in February and June. Seven earlier Block 1 <ORGANIZATION> Navstars </ORGANIZATION> also are orbiting the Earth. The new model has more power and improved systems and has added the coded military channel.

 Soaring imports contributed to a $ 3.8 billion deficit in trade and tourism last year, official reports said today. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> recorded an increase, however, in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s foreign currency reserves, excluding gold, to $ 17.3 billion from $ 15.2 billion in 1987, the <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> Daily said. The report said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> posted a $ 7.13 billion surplus in its capital accounts, including direct investment and international loans. The $ 3.8 billion deficit in the current account, which includes trade and tourism, was largely due to a doubling of the nation's trade deficit because of sluggish export growth and soaring imports, it said According to <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> accounting procedures, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s exports in 1988 totaled $ 41 billion, up 18.2 percent over 1987, while its imports grew 27.4 percent to $ 46.3 billion, the report said. The resulting $ 5.3 billion trade deficit was double that of 1987, the report said. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday reported a $ 700 million trade deficit for July, the official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said.

<HEAD>Chicago Symphony Reaches Out to Black Audience</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Symphony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orchestra </ORGANIZATION>, which has performed to acclaim worldwide, will be leaving for <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> again next week, but first it will try to win over a new audience at home. Its performances this weekend at a black, South Side church are aimed at dispelling the notion that symphony concerts are white, elitist events. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, the black assistant conductor who put the show together says the idea of the concerts _ during which he'll direct a symphony by a celebrated black composer, as well as several black soloists _ is to establish a `` two-way flow'' between the orchestra and the black community. `` We certainly want to include as many parts and ethnic groups in the city as we can,'' <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> said. `` We start in the black community because of the misconception that there is no interest in the black community in this sort of music.'' <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> said he still encounters `` the attitude that Orchestra Hall concerts are white, elitist events, and that members of the black community are n't really welcome ... that's not true.'' The orchestra rarely performs outside of Orchestra Hall or its summer home in the northern suburbs. It first reached out to the city's <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION> with an outdoor concert in 1987, but the rain-marred Memorial Day event was a bust that drew few spectators. Then came the chance to perform tonight and Saturday at <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION>, a relatively new church that seats nearly 4,000 and boasts the talented <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ensemble </ORGANIZATION> _ a 90-voice choir that performed with the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Symphony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Choir </ORGANIZATION> in April. `` Blacks do not historically come to hear a symphony _ they may be fans of classical music, but they do n't come to Orchestra Hall to hear a symphony,'' said <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Idema </PERSON>, an orchestra spokeswoman. `` We thought that this was a wonderful opportunity to go to them.'' <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> said he will direct the Symphony No. 1, the `` Afro-American'' symphony written in 1930 by <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> <PERSON> Still </PERSON>, the first widely played black composer. Black vocal soloists <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON> <PERSON> McMillian </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Holt </PERSON> will perform songs by <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON>, and the temple ensemble will perform an excerpt from a Brahms requiem as well as spirituals `` to show the roots of the whole process,'' <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> said. A native of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> studied in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> and has performed as a guest conductor with major opera companies and symphony orchestras in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and abroad before joining the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> symphony in 1986. Still, he is one of the few black artists working in the upper levels of a major symphony. <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> noted there are still no full-time black instrumentalists with the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> symphony. Tonight's sold-out concert and a second performance for young people on Saturday are a chance to start to change that, he said. `` It falls upon us now to start to see that students from the various minority communities have early enough exposure and sufficient training to be ready to pass the rather arduous audition process'' for a major symphony, said the 31-year-old <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, a black, 15-year-old <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> high school student, will be a featured soloist in the Glazunov Saxophone Concerto at Saturday's performance. `` To see this young black man ... hopefully will be very inspirational to the young black people,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayes </PERSON>, who writes much of the music for the temple ensemble. King, who aspires to be a classical saxophonist with a major orchestra someday, shares the message <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> hopes to carry. ` I think it will show people that classical music is not really for a certain type of crowd _ everyone can enjoy it,'' he said.

 The dollar firmed against the yen Friday, while share prices declined in slow trading. The dollar opened at 143.50 yen, and ranged between 143.05 and 143.58 yen. It closed at 143.58 yen, up 1.20 yen from its 142.32-yen finish Thursday. On the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, which had gained 5.96 points Thursday, shed 26.97 points, or 0.08 percent, closing at 35,063.14 points. The index fell in thin trading as the majority of institutional and foreign investors avoided buying and stepped off to the sidelines, dealers said. `` Because the dollar-yen rate is now at a turning point, investors were reluctant to make major moves, which made trading directionless and thin,'' said a dealer with <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity.

 The state of <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> has a triple standard on premarital sex, says the lawyer for a man appealing a finding of discrimination for refusing to rent to an unmarried couple. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, who represented <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> area resident Layle French before the state <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday, said the state's fornication law is in conflict with a law that gives unmarried couples the right to housing. Furthermore, he said, the state university system forbids couples to cohabitate in dormitories _ an apparent violation of the anti-discrimination law ordinary landlords must follow, <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> told the three-member panel. `` I do n't see how they can have it both ways,'' he said. Hundreds of supporters of French, a carpenter, have turned out for rallies throughout the state.

About 400 people from around the country have contributed $ 1 each to a defense fund for French, which includes another $ 2,000 from larger contributors, <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said. `` All discrimination is not bad,'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said. `` Layle's discriminating against what many people view as immoral _ fornication. <PERSON> Andrea </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitau </PERSON> <PERSON> Kircher </PERSON>, an assistant state attorney general, countered <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s argument by saying the state university system may be subject to different laws than ordinary landlords.

In the <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> case, French agreed in February 1988 to rent his former house in <LOCATION> Marshall </LOCATION> to <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Parsons </PERSON>. But he said he quickly changed his mind and returned her damage deposit after he decided it would be against his religious beliefs. <PERSON> Parsons </PERSON> had told French she would be living with her fiance. The two are now married. French said he is willing to pay the woman $ 348 in damages she sustained by having to change her rental plans, but he refuses to pay a $ 700 civil penalty imposed by an administrative law judge who ruled June 7 that French violated the state's anti-discrimination law. The appeals panel said it would rule within 90 days.

<HEAD>Assembly Race Seen as Political Weather Vane</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Election officials guarded polling places today during balloting for a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> seat in a <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> race that is viewed as a test of support for the governing party. There were six candidates, including one sponsored by dissident groups. Political analysts said the race was too close to call and officials results were not expected until Saturday. The <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, already concerned with charges of illegal campaigning, said today more than 100 election officials were stationed at polling places to guard against violence and election fraud. President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> sent a letter to party members in the district urging support for <PERSON> Rha </PERSON> <PERSON> Woong-bae </PERSON>, a former deputy prime minister. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> called the race `` a litmus test which would determine the course the nation would take.'' <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON>, head of the largest opposition party, the <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>, said the election was a midterm appraisal of the government and predicted voters would side with the opposition. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Yong-hee </PERSON>, a three-term lawmaker, is that party's candidate. The <LOCATION> Yongdungpo </LOCATION> district in southwestern <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> is seen as a microcosm of Korean political thinking. The district includes urban middle-class workers, and laborers and because many of the voters are newcomers to <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> it reflects the regional antagonism in <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> politics. In the last election, the winning candidate and two opposition candidates were within 551 votes of each other. Election officials say there are 168,812 registered voters in the district. Today's election was called after the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled in May that the 1988 election of governing party candidate <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Myung-sup </PERSON> was null and void because of illegal campaigning. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> is not running. Charges of unfair campaigning have been widespread and include vote buying, distribution of illegal materials, slander and illegal meetings. On Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> ruled <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> violated the law by sending letters to non-party members asking voters to support the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> candidate. The other candidates are <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Won-bum </PERSON>, a former lawmaker from the <ORGANIZATION> Reunification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>; Park Sang-woong of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Ko </PERSON> <PERSON> Young-koo </PERSON>, a lawyer running with support from dissident groups; and <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyung-joo </PERSON>, an independent candidate.

 The foreign secretary expressed regret over the death of an Australian missionary slain in a hostage drama and lawmakers today called for an investigation to determine if she was shot by troops. <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamill </PERSON>, 36, of <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION> was among five hostages and 16 convicts who died Tuesday before troops recaptured the jail at <LOCATION> Davao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, 610 miles south of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. Convicts had seized the hostages during religious services Sunday. Miss <PERSON> Hamill </PERSON> arrived in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> last month. `` We regret she had to lose her life that way,'' Foreign Secretary <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> told reporters. `` She was pursuing a vocation which required her to expose her life in extraordinary ways. Under those circumstances, of course, sometimes it is not possible to give full protection. We regret that happened.'' In <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION>, officials said <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> had written Prime Minister <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> to express `` heartfelt sorrow'' over Miss <PERSON> Hamill </PERSON>'s murder, saying security forces were left with no choice after the prison inmates started killing the captives. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> also expressed condolences to Ms. <PERSON> Hamill </PERSON>'s family, the officials said. Miss <PERSON> Hamill </PERSON> bled to death after being shot in the back, according to <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> officials. Doctors said she apparently had been shot from a distance because there were no powder burns on the body. This led to speculation that she may have been shot by military snipers who returned gunfire when convicts tried to escape using their captives as shields. Rep. <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitra </PERSON>, speaker of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION>, and Sen. <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziga </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said they wanted an investigation to determine whether Miss <PERSON> Hamill </PERSON> was shot by soldiers. `` That's very crucial,'' <PERSON> Ziga </PERSON> said. `` I have not heard of any occasion where rescuers shot at prisoners and endangered the lives of the hostages.'' The Australian Embassy in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> has also asked for clarification of the circumstances of her death.

<TEXT>
 Tens of thousands of Russian workers in <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> called off their crippling nine-day walkout today and labor leaders began intensive talks with the Baltic republic's government, strike organizers said. `` While the negotiations go on, the cannons are silent,'' strike committee member <PERSON> Marat </PERSON> <PERSON> Chekatovsky </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from the Estonian capital of <LOCATION> Tallinn </LOCATION>. Employees at about 50 factories and at the republic's ports and railroads agreed to return to work after strike leaders and Estonian officials set an agenda for negotiations Thursday, <PERSON> Chekatovksy </PERSON> said. State-run <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> reported early today that the talks were meant to `` ease the highly charged political and economic situation in <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> and calm down ethnic passions.'' The Russian workers walked out to protest a law passed Aug. 8 by the Estonian parliament that set the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s first residency requirements for voters and candidates. Russians and other non-ethnic Estonians, who make up about 40 percent of the republic's population of 1.6 million, complained that about 80,000 of them would be disenfranchised The national Presidium on Wednesday declared the law unconstitutional in a decision approved by President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Chekatovksy </PERSON> said that although the strike might be renewed, it had accomplished many of its organizers' goals. `` <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and the whole <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the world started to pay attention to us,'' he said. Strike leaders on Thursday said they planned to continue the strike until Estonian leaders agreed to accept the Presidium's decision and change the law, but <PERSON> Chekatovsky </PERSON> said strike committee and factory representatives voted late Thursday to return to work The strike `` was starting to work against us,'' he said, referring to the growing economic difficulties it caused in the tiny Baltic republic. <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION>, the government daily, on Thursday quoted Railway Minister <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Konarev </PERSON> as saying the walkout had idled 3,000 railcars in <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, of which more than 700 were left on railway lines, blocking dozens of trains from proceeding. In <LOCATION> Tallinn </LOCATION> alone, where all stations that load and unload freight were paralyzed by the walkout, 34 trains carrying perishable foodstuffs and other goods waited to be discharged Thursday, <PERSON> Konarev </PERSON> said. In another area threatened by nationalist labor unrest, Russian workers in <LOCATION> Moldavia </LOCATION> staged a two-hour warning strike Wednesday. They were protesting a proposed law that would make Moldavian the republic's official language.

<TEXT>
 It's off to the auction block for a 20-foot, 250-pound python known to gobble down raccoons `` like they were marshmallows'' within the glow of the glitzy <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> beach strip. A veteran animal trapper who helped wrestle the snake from under a home Thursday said he hopes to get at least $ 500 from a zoo or nature preserve. The snake, which slithered about the residental seaside neighborhood for years, was stuffed into a sleeping bag after it was displayed to curious onlookers and news cameras. `` He wo n't have to eat for about a week,'' said <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardwick </PERSON>, owner of Pesky Critters Relocation in suburban <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. `` When it is time, I might feed him a rabbit.'' `` We saw the head at first and everyone said, ` Wow!''' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Moxley </PERSON>, a park ranger at <ORGANIZATION> Hugh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Taylor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Birch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recreation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION>, where the snake searched for its prey. `` When it all came out, everybody just screamed.'' <PERSON> Hardwick </PERSON> believes the python was a pet released years ago in the park and probably rested under the house when not hunting for food. `` The homeowners had been calling people for a month, but no one wanted to go after it,'' said <PERSON> Hardwick </PERSON>, whose company traps nuisance animals in south <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. `` People say they've seen it eat 30-pound raccoons like they were marshmallows.'' The reticulate python, a native of <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, can grow to more than 30 feet. Though not venomous, the snake coils around prey to stop breathing and blood flow. On Wednesday, <PERSON> Hardwick </PERSON> and a three-man crew began digging tunnels below the home. They found the snake about eight feet underground next to a concrete wall. `` I got close enough to snare it and then we just attacked,'' he said. `` It showed no fear of us. It's a proud reptile. He could have broken our ribs in the flash of an eye.'' Homeowner <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Spalding </PERSON> said he was unafraid of the reptile, but he was concerned for others. `` The thing that frightened us was that he could come out and attack a small child,'' he said.

 Advocates for the homeless say they're waiting for <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> to back up his rhetoric with cash for housing programs. As <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> spoke Thursday to a gathering of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, his audience gave several standing ovations but held to a wait-and-see attitude. `` We do n't think it's reasonable or moral to have property boarded up while people sleep in the streets and in shelters,'' said <ORGANIZATION> SCLC </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON>. `` While we are waiting, we've got to utilize whatever funds are available to the best advantage. That's why we are anxious to work with <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> delivered a brief address that reiterated his position of improving housing for the poor and adopting a get-tough stance with the scandal-ridden <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>. But <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> homeless advocate <PERSON> Mitch </PERSON> <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> responded to <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s speech with an attack on the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration for swiftly bailing out savings and loan associations while ignoring funding needs for housing `` I did n't hear a ... word from Mr. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> about money. And I've been waiting for him and his boss to start talking about money,'' <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> said <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> said the housing budget proposed by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration `` contained less money for housing than the last budget that was introduced by Mr. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s 1990 budget allows $ 15.1 billion for housing, compared to the $ 12.9 billion in the 1989 budget, drafted under <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. The 1988 budget, also under <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, allowed $ 18.6 billion for housing. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> spoke at the <ORGANIZATION> SCLC </ORGANIZATION>'s 32nd annual convention about cleaning up his department. `` I want to clean it out. I want to make sure it works for the needy, not the greedy,'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said. `` We're going to make it work for the poor again. I pledge that to you.'' He left soon after the speech for <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Comedian-activist <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON>, a panelist, expressed displeasure with <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s speedy departure. `` We need to bring <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> not to speak, but to listen,'' <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> said.

In April, with the help of <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> and several local homeless advocacy groups, it seized a boarded-up, foreclosed <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> house and cleaned it up for use by the homeless.

 Iranian President <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> promised help to free Western hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> provided the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> improves relations with his country, and he cited frozen Iranian assets as one sore point. `` I have said many times that if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> expects us to help in the <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> issue, it should show in practice that it has dropped its hostile stand against us,'' he told <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s foreign minister after being sworn into office Thursday before <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> The official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> quoted Foreign Minister <PERSON> Yaqoub </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> as saying he had been asked to seek <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s cooperation in freeing the 16 hostages, who include eight Americans Most are held by pro-Iranian groups. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> indicated it could be some time before there could be any accommodation on the hostage issue, according to <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>. `` If the Americans really do have good will, it must take a very long time before this good will can be proven in practice,'' he said. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> had shown hostility toward <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> by freezing billions of dollars in Iranian assets and by supporting <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> in its eight-year war with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. On Sunday <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> would `` use its maximum influence for the release of all the hostages'' if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> freed $ 2 billion in Iranian assets. The assets were frozen 10 years ago after Iranians seized the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days. But in what appears to be a continuing power struggle between hard-liners and pragmatists, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s spiritual leader <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> said Monday that there would be no dealings with the `` cursed'' <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. At the swearing-in Thursday, <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> pledged to use the increased powers of the presidency to avoid political strife, but he acknowledged that political infighting has undermined efforts to form a Cabinet. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, a middle-ranking clergyman, took over from <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON>, who was elected the Islamic republic's supreme spiritual leader after the death of <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> on June 3. The new president leads the so-called pragmatists in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, who favor improving relations with the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> to gain technology and financing for rebuilding an economy devastated by the Iran-Iraq war.

 A man has sued a prestigious prep school, saying his son's education extended to drugs and alcohol with the school's knowledge. Dr. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Palao </PERSON> alleges in a lawsuit filed in federal court in <LOCATION> Trenton </LOCATION> that his 13-year-old son <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> became addicted to drugs and alcohol at <ORGANIZATION> Lawrenceville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. Palao charges that officials knew of and condoned drug and alcohol use by youths at the boarding school that was established in 1810 and has turned out such alumni as publisher <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> Sr. and rock' n' roll star <PERSON> Huey </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>. At the end of each semester, housemasters responsible for the youth's dormitory would pass out containers to collect contraband `` as a form of general amnesty,'' the lawsuit charges. `` The contraband collected would generally fill a large plastic trash bag,'' the lawsuit alleges. Officials at the <ORGANIZATION> Lawrenceville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> said they had not seen the lawsuit and were not prepared to comment on it, according to <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Silvestri </PERSON>, secretary to Associate Headmaster <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>. Palao of <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, enrolled his son in September 1985 at the school, which is about 10 miles north of <LOCATION> Trenton </LOCATION>. He removed <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> from the school in 1988 after learning he had become addicted to drugs and alcohol, his lawyer, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Perrucci </PERSON>, said Thursday. <PERSON> Perrucci </PERSON> said the boy began using marijuana and alcohol during his first year. Since leaving the school he has undergone drug rehabilitation at a cost of $ 32,304, the lawyer said. The lawsuit names the school and four top educators. <PERSON> Perrucci </PERSON> said his client wants to be reimbursed for the drug counseling and $ 33,739 in tuition paid over three years. The lawsuit also seeks personal damages for the boy's mental anguish, loss of reputation and damages for two lost years of income as a result of the interruption of his schooling, the lawyer said.

<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION> reunion concert drew just a handful of people, and promoters offered cut-rate tickets to thousands who came to the site of the original concert on the event's 20th anniversary. State police estimated 10,000 people Thursday night were at the farm, once owned by <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Yasgur </PERSON>, where more than 400,000 young people gathered Aug. 15-17, 1969, for <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION>. At the Imperial Hotel in <LOCATION> Swan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, about 10 miles away, the audience of 250 attending the opening of a three-day `` Remember Woodstock'' concert was almost outnumbered by security guards, vendors and reporters. Promoters had hoped for a crowd of 4,000. Thursday afternoon, `` Remember Woodstock'' promoters sent buses over to the <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION> site, hoping to entice customers with cheap tickets and a free ride to the hotel and back. There were few takers for the $ 5 tickets, which originally had been priced at $ 30, promoters said. Some people who attended the Imperial concert left the hotel to go to the original site, where free music was offered on a makeshift stage. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, the unofficial master of ceremonies in <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION>, said Imperial Vice President <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> was booed from the stage when he tried to entice people to go to the hotel. `` They had six buses up here,'' <PERSON> Pell </PERSON> said. `` They asked $ 5 a ticket and they bus you up there. Four people left. The music is here.'' Concert promoter <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> blamed the small turnout in part to rumors that major rock groups were going to appear at the <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION> site. <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> said the concert could break even if about 6,000 people attend the three-day event. He said he expects attendance to increase considerably Friday and Saturday. `` All my business sense told me not to try it,'' said Imperial owner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Chung </PERSON>. `` But I tell you now, we're going to make this thing an annual event.'' The Imperial concert started about 5 p.m. when <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION>'s original master of ceremonies, <ORGANIZATION> Wavy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gravy </ORGANIZATION>, shirtless and wearing tie-dyed shorts and a propeller beanie, came on stage `` I challenge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> to a debate,'' he said, responding to federal drug czar <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s lament earlier this week that the press was glorifying the memory of a 1969 concert well-known for rampant drug use. Gravy introduced Thursday's performers, who included <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION> veteran <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sebastian </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Massengil </PERSON>, Futu Futu, <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Nininger </PERSON> and Family, the <ORGANIZATION> Woodstock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> All </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Band </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Winter </PERSON>.

<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A wildfire that charred more than 15,000 acres in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Riverside </LOCATION> counties was started by an arsonist, not a target shooter's stray bullet as initially reported, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. The blaze, which started July 29 near <LOCATION> Vail </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> Riverside </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, burned out of control for 10 days and came dangerously close to the <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palomar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observatory </ORGANIZATION> before 2,800 firefighters encircled it. <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> LaNier </PERSON>, special agent in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> Cleveland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>, said Thursday that investigators recovered the remnants of an incendiary device `` at the point of origin.'' He only would not be specific about the device, and only said it started the fire. <PERSON> LaNier </PERSON> said forestry officials knew arson was the cause five days after the fire started. But officials continued to cite the target-shooting theory because they did n't want to risk compromising their probe, <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Nier </PERSON> said. Authorities have questioned several people. No arrests have been made. The cost of battling the blaze, which at one point threatened a 2,000-acre reserve for spotted owls and bald eagles, has been estimated at $ 8 million. The fire destroyed a watershed in the <ORGANIZATION> Cleveland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Riverside </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, it destroyed a three-bedroom home, a mobile home, a trailer and several sheds. The blaze was contained on Aug. 7, but about 200 firefighters remain on the scene mopping up.

 Rep. <PERSON> Larkin </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s widow characterized her husband as a good family man as well as a loyal public servant. `` <PERSON> Larkin </PERSON> loved his family,'' <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said Thursday during the funeral Mass for the freshman <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> congressman. `` He always held my hand and held me close to him. He always made me feel special.'' Standing with their daughter, <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON>, and 6-month-old grandson, <PERSON> Bryce </PERSON> <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said she and her husband `` always joked about death'' and `` he wanted his epitaph to read, ` Mission aborted, gone home.''' The 45-year-old Republican was killed Sunday night as he traveled to his home in <LOCATION> Gulfport </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Hattiesburg </LOCATION>, where he had thrown out the first pitch in a youth baseball series. The bodies of <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> and pilot <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Vierling </PERSON> were found Monday in the scattered wreckage of a single-engine Cessna 177. Investigators with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> have said <PERSON> Vierling </PERSON>, 58, apparently strayed from his anticipated flight path on the 70-mile trip before clipping a tree in the <ORGANIZATION> DeSoto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> officials said Thursday that they had ruled out mechanical problems as a cause of the crash. The investigation now centers on weather conditions and the pilot's actions, said <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> investigator. About 20 congressmen arrived from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to attend the funeral at the <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Biloxi </LOCATION>. Most of the state's top political leaders and several hundred law enforcement officers from <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> also were among about 3,000 mourners. Catholic Bishop <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Howze </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Biloxi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diocese </LOCATION>, who delivered the eulogy, said <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> `` lived a life of faith, hope and love in following after the pattern set by <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Howze </PERSON> said <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a member of a Pass Christian parish, `` shared the challenge of creating a better world'' and demonstrated `` a solid commitment to everything he encountered.'' `` He was dedicated, he was honest, he was professional, he was helpful,'' said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON>, chief deputy with the <ORGANIZATION> Harrison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> headed before going to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, in January. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> spent 22 years in law enforcement, serving also as police chief in <LOCATION> Gulfport </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Here are sketches of the three candidates proposed by Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> on Thursday for the post of prime minister:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> BRONISLAW </PERSON> <PERSON> GEREMEK </PERSON> _ In April, when Solidarity was legalized after a seven-year ban, <PERSON> Geremek </PERSON> faced a tough decision: whether to return after years of opposition activity to the academic world of medieval studies or continue to serve Solidarity's march to democracy as a top adviser. The 57-year-old professor, fluent in French and proficient in at least two other languages, chose Solidarity. <PERSON> Geremek </PERSON> became a well-known figure in the opposition in the late 1970s when he lectured on officially taboo topics of Polish history and culture in private apartments as part of the so-called `` Flying University'' created in the late 1970s. He crossed paths with workers during the <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> strikes in August 1980. Soon after the strikes broke out, <PERSON> Geremek </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>, another Solidarity candidate for prime minister, rushed north with a letter signed by intellectuals urging authorities to find a solution without force. The strikers invited <PERSON> Geremek </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> to stay at the strike as their advisers. The historian's life has not been the same since. He was arrested Dec. 13, 1981, when martial-law was declared. He was released a year later and then fired in 1985 from his academic job because of his continued role as a Solidarity adviser. <PERSON> Geremek </PERSON> was elected a deputy to parliament in the June elections and then chosen to lead the Solidarity caucus. He is one of <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s chief representatives in meetings with top foreign officials. Since the union was legalized in April, he has traveled to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> for meetings with senior officials and last week met Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> JACEK </PERSON> <PERSON> KURON </PERSON> _ The longtime rebel, now 55, is one of the fiercest fighters for greater democracy in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> lost the young recruit by expelling him from the party eight months after he joined in March 1953 for refusing to submit to a required session of self-criticism. A historian and teacher, <PERSON> Kuron </PERSON>'s 1964 `` Open Letter to Party'' criticized the Communist system for abusing workers. For it, he served three years in prison. Authorities accused him of instigating student demonstrations in 1968 and kept him in jail for another 3 -LCB- years. In 1976, he helped found the Committee for the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> to help workers fired from their jobs and forced to stand trial after worker riots that year. A tireless pamphleteer, <PERSON> Kuron </PERSON> seemed born for politics. There was hardly an important opposition declaration he did n't sign in the 1970s, and in 1980 he became an adviser to strikers in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>. He, too, was rounded up on the December 1981 night that martial-law was proclaimed. Released in an amnesty in 1984, <PERSON> Kuron </PERSON> immediately began holding news conferences and issuing reports on the conditions of those still in jail. Elected a deputy in the June elections, <PERSON> Kuron </PERSON> is on the presidium of the Solidarity caucus in parliament.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> TADEUSZ </PERSON> <PERSON> MAZOWIECKI </PERSON> _ <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>, 62, is the least public candidate for prime minister, a close confidant of <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> with strong ties to the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>, trained as a lawyer, was one of the founders in 1957 of the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligentsia </ORGANIZATION>, known in Polish as <ORGANIZATION> KIK </ORGANIZATION>, an influential forum that served as a bulwark for <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> opposition to communist ideology. He served in parliament as part of ZNAK, a group of Roman Catholics who supported regeneration of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> based on Catholic values. <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> initiated a letter by more than 60 intellectuals urging authorities to find a peaceful solution to the strikes that broke out on the Baltic coast in August 1980 and led to the formation of the independent Solidarity trade union. He was jailed during martial-law, and when released became <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s assistant and remained a top adviser to <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> during the years that the union was banned. He did not run for parliament, preferring to edit <ORGANIZATION> Tygodnik </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Solidarnosc </ORGANIZATION>, the Solidarity weekly revived after the union was legalized in April.

 Police began a search today for four men who made off with $ 1 million in cash during a robbery on a busy highway. Police said the robbers, all in their 20s or 30s, Thursday stopped in front of a car carrying two men transporting teachers' salaries near <LOCATION> Kongju </LOCATION>, in the central part of the country <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Yong-man </PERSON>, 33, told police three of the robbers, one of whom had a gun, forced him and his companion to get out of the car. The three bandits then jumped in the car containing the cash and drove off, followed by the fourth robber in another car, police said. They said many cars were traveling on the highway when the robbery occurred about noon. One witness said she saw a man holding a gun when she drove by, but thought it was an officer, police said. The stolen money was to be paid as salaries to teachers and school staff in the <LOCATION> Kongju </LOCATION> district. Salaries in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> are usually paid in cash.

 President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> today threatened to fire her justice secretary and other officials if they fail to arrest corrupt government employees, tax evaders and other `` big fish'' criminals by the end of the year. In a statement addressed to <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Sedfrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Ordonez </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said her adminstration has failed to enforce laws because of a double standard favoring the rich. `` Nothing impairs the credibility of government more than the common perception that we have two standards of justice, one for the poor, and another for the rich and powerful,'' she said in the statement, released to news media. `` We have done nothing to disprove this perception. Until now we have not secured the conviction of that elusive ` big fish,''' she added. `` I am now placing all of you under probation,'' she said. `` At the end of the year, we will assess your performance as individuals and a department. If I am not satisfied, I will not hesitate to exercise my power to remove appointees.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s former spokesman, <PERSON> Teodoro </PERSON> <PERSON> Benigno </PERSON>, says the president knows who the biggest offenders in the government and private sector are but has not moved against them because of a lack of evidence. `` The president will need ... audacity in dealing with graft and corruption,'' <PERSON> Benigno </PERSON> wrote recently in the newspaper The Philippine Star. `` And she'll have to do away with that tired, old cliche that she needs proof.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> `` knows who the big grafters are, who the big tax evaders are, who the big smugglers are.

<HEAD>Army Reservist Linked to Beating Death Kills Himself, Reports Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARJORIE OLSTER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An army reserve member who feared he would be blamed for the beating death of a Palestinian killed himself with a burst of machine-gun fire, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> news reports said today. <PERSON> Yariv </PERSON> <PERSON> Bar-Yosef </PERSON>, 25, shot himself in the head with his Uzi machine gun early Thursday, the reports said. An army spokeswoman said she could not comment because the case involving <PERSON> Bar-Yosef </PERSON> was still under investigation. Also today, a new security policy went into effect that requires Palestinians entering <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to carry computerized identity cards. Palestinians said they would boycott their jobs in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to protest the restriction. Traffic into <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was light from both <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> and the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. But officials blamed this more on Friday being the Moslem prayer day than on the call by uprising leaders for workers to boycott jobs in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Palestinian reporters said a true test of the boycott would probably come Sunday, when workers from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> return to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> after the <PERSON> Jewish </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabbath </PERSON>. Israeli officials say the card system is intended to prevent those with criminal or security records from entering <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> following a series of attacks on Jews by Arabs. Palestinians argue the system is a further attempt by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to quell the revolt against occupation by putting an economic squeeze on <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, where poverty is widespread and few jobs are available. At least 537 Palestinians have been killed in clashes with soldiers or other Israelis in the 20-month-old Palestinian uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Ninety-five other Palestinians have been killed by fellow <PERSON> Arabs </PERSON> as alleged collaborators with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, and 38 Israelis also have been slain. <PERSON> Bar-Yosef </PERSON> was among soldiers being investigated by military police in connection with the Aug. 22, 1988, beating death of <PERSON> Hani </PERSON> <PERSON> El-Shami </PERSON>, 42, in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. A military tribunal ruled that the death resulted from blows <PERSON> El-Shami </PERSON> received at the army's Jabaliya detention following an earlier beating that day by soldiers at his home. Four soldiers of the elite <ORGANIZATION> Givati </ORGANIZATION> brigade, who are stationed at the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>'s Jabiliya refugee camp, were acquitted of manslaughter and convicted of brutality. <PERSON> Bar-Yosef </PERSON>, who was not among those convicted in the earlier trial, served in a reserve unit as a guard in the detention center. He testified that he kicked <PERSON> El-Shami </PERSON> in the shoulder on the day he died, the daily <ORGANIZATION> Yediot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ahronot </ORGANIZATION> said today. The trial raised a controversy over <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>'s declared policy of beating Palestinian demonstrators in an effort to halt the uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation. Shortly after the trial, a military judge was appointed to reopen the inquiry into <PERSON> El-Shami </PERSON>'s death. <ORGANIZATION> Yediot </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Bar-Yosef </PERSON> was questioned several times since by military police. According to <ORGANIZATION> Yediot </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bar-Yosef </PERSON> said in the suicide note he feared he would become the next scapegoat of the Givati affair. He referred to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> as `` a land that devours its people'' and expressed fears he would be imprisoned. <PERSON> Bar-Yosef </PERSON>, a student at <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Hebrew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, was found dead outside government-owned <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION>, where he worked part-time as a security guard. He had been shot in the head with his own Uzi.

 Cocaine corruption is sweeping across the hemisphere, with one <LOCATION> Bahamian </LOCATION> official offering to sell traffickers every ounce of the drug confiscated in that island nation, a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> witness says. `` In the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>, it goes all the way to the top,'' convicted drug smuggler <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Mermelstein </PERSON> said Thursday, testifying from behind a screen while six government bodyguards stood by. The federally protected witness told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in an electronically disguised voice that before his 1985 arrest he smuggled up to 55 tons of cocaine into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as an employee of `` the boys from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>.'' He has been cooperating with the government and has a price on his head that committee Chairman <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, D-Del., placed at $ 3 million <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> called the hearing to provide background before the administration unveils its comprehensive drug-fighting program next month. <PERSON> Mermelstein </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been slowed in its moves to combat Colombian traffickers in part `` because we deal directly with the police and local governments and in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> that's a direct line to the cartel.'' High-ranking <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> officers appear immune to cocaine corruption in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, he said, but other officials are either bribed or murdered. `` Either they take the money or they die,'' he said. He said the corruption was by no means confined to <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and that he was once `` offered a deal of so much per kilo for any cocaine confiscated by the <LOCATION> Bahamian </LOCATION> government for distribution in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' `` We were setting it up but I was arrested,'' he said. He said one cartel pilot, forced by plane trouble to set down in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> with a load of cocaine, was told a $ 10,000 payoff would always buy emergency landing privileges. Cocaine kingpins have used billions of `` narcodollars'' from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sales to follow a globe-hopping lifestyle, with visits to the bullfights in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> as well as the Olympic games in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mermelstein </PERSON> said. In other testimony, the commandant of the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>, Gen. <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, told the panel he is skeptical about so-called boot camps advocated by some law enforcement officials for young drug offenders instead of prison. `` I can tell you right up front if you do n't provide an alternative it will fail,'' he said, adding that <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> boot camp is designed to produce fighting men and not to punish offenders. `` It's a completely different kind of socialization,'' he said. He said the `` center of gravity'' in fighting drugs in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is on the side of stopping demand rather than supply and was critical of the idea of a military attack on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> coca fields. `` I hope we can have a more balanced and far-reaching thought process ... because we live in a more complex world than that, and I think we all know that,'' he said. A former assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregorie </PERSON>, told the committee the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Marshals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> developed a plan to arrest Colombian drug kingpin <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> last fall during a trip to <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, and fly him to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for trial, but the plan was dropped because of <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> opposition. <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> has been indicted by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grand juries several times, but the <ORGANIZATION> Colombian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> abrogated that country's extradition treaty with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> two years ago and he can not be arrested by his country's authorities on a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warrant.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, a proud and historic country now under Marxist rule, could be the prize as the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> gradually loosens its ties to client states and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> tries to cope with famine and hunger in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The death in an air crash last week of Rep. <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Democrat who was a strong friend to <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> and anyone suffering from hunger, touched off a cooperative search that is likely to lead to better relations _ provided two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> conditions are met. Those conditions, as outlined by senior <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials, are a continuing improvement in human rights and a serious effort by <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION> to reconcile with separationists in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION> region and an autonomous movement in <LOCATION> Tigray </LOCATION>. `` There exists a window of opportunity evolving from this tragedy,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, who served with <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Hunger and was in the helicopter that spotted the <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> plane's wreckage. `` The Soviets have said they are cutting <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> off. <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> needs to be adopted and supported by somebody.'' On Thursday, former President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> announced Thursday that he will serve as a neutral observer when Ethiopian officials and leaders of a rebel group hold preliminary peace talks next month at <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s policy center in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said the talks between the government of <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Eritrean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> will last for several days and will lay the groundwork for further negotiations toward ending the <LOCATION> Ethiopian </LOCATION> civil war <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> prefers the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> not deal with <ORGANIZATION> Marxist-Leninist </ORGANIZATION> governments. Laws restrict official business with <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, and the 1961 Foreign Assistance Act bars <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to many comunist countries, with exceptions. Other laws prohibit <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for international loans to countries that systematically violate human rights and bar aid to countries that have not paid their debts _ both of which apply to <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> is eligible for humanitarian assistance, and during a 1988 famine the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> provided about $ 120 million _ the largest outlay to any African country that year. Not one Ethiopian died in the drought, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said Thursday with evident pride. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign policy is governed by complex considerations and not just the political stripe of a country _ as evidenced by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s offer of economic development aid to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> in a bid to encourage capitalism in those East European countries. The fact that there are about 2,000 political prisoners in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> is considered a much larger obstacle to friendlier <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> relations than the governing Marxist philosophy in <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> is the oldest independent country in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and one of the oldest in the world. Its ties to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> began with the signing of a military assistance agreement in 1976. The next year <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> scrapped its weapons pact with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and Soviet arms and Cuban troops helped <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> expel Somali forces from the <LOCATION> Ogaden </LOCATION> region in 1977 and 1978. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> did not break off relations with <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, which date back to 1903. But its embassies are not headed by ambassadors _ a sign of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> distaste for the regime of President <PERSON> Mengistu </PERSON> <PERSON> Haile </PERSON> <PERSON> Mariam </PERSON>. Nonetheless, Uncle <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> has been ready with a helping hand. `` Our major interest is the welfare of the people,'' said a senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official of humanitarian assistance to <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> or any other Marxist country. There are strategic motivations, as well, for the gradual improvement in relations. <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON> stressed foreign policy considerations in an interview Wednesday. The guerrillas in <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tigray </LOCATION> `` are beating -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Mengistu </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- to a pulp,'' <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON> said. `` If <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> gets severed you basically have <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> control of the whole border of the <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. It would be giving the region away to the Arab world. Government by fundamentalism is a tremendous threat.'' Therefore, the congressman said, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration should upgrade its relations with <ORGANIZATION> Mengistu </ORGANIZATION>. `` He is willing to make concessions, to act out of his need for survival,'' <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON> concluded. Some <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials offer a somewhat different analysis. The Eritrean <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, which has been at war with the central government for 27 years, is about 50 percent Christian in background, and fundamentalism is not a driving force in neighboring <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION>. Still, <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials agree that it would be good to improve relations. `` A friendly and coherent <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> would have an effect on its neighbors, too,'' said a senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official. `` Access to that part of the world is important. It should n't be overstated. It is an area that is important to be open and not to have doors closed to us.''

 The eight folks who showed up to claim a $ 24 million lottery prize last month are n't smiling any more, now that one of them has sued six of the others claiming they are n't entitled to any of the winnings. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Macieko </PERSON>, 42, of <LOCATION> Bellmore </LOCATION> contends in court papers filed Thursday that he and his fiancee, <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Salenga </PERSON>, 38, of <LOCATION> Dix </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, were the only true winners in the July 12 drawing, the fifth-biottery history. He charged that he was intimidated and threatened with the loss of the prize money to include the other six, all members oggest in state lf the <PERSON> Welsch </PERSON> family of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, in the winning ticket. The Welsches deny the charge. <PERSON> Macieko </PERSON> is the former owner of the <ORGANIZATION> Liberty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Card </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Store </ORGANIZATION>, where the winning ticket was purchased. He and <PERSON> Salenga </PERSON> sold the shop to brothers <PERSON> William </PERSON>, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Welsch </PERSON> a year ago. <PERSON> Macieko </PERSON> said he had played Lotto at the card shop twice a week for the past 10 years using the same numbers _ 1, 4, 9, 16, 24, 32. In court papers, <PERSON> Macieko </PERSON> contends he had an arrangement with <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Welsch </PERSON> to play those numbers twice a week on his behalf. During a July 17 news conference to announce jackpot winners, <PERSON> Macieko </PERSON> and <PERSON> Salenga </PERSON>, the three <PERSON> Welsch </PERSON> brothers and three other family members said they had been buying tickets as a group everreplied that although <PERSON> Macieko </PERSON> picked the numbers, <PERSON> Welsch </PERSON> had bought the ticket _ and that made <PERSON> Welsch </PERSON> the winner. `` I pleaded with him, ` Do n't do this to me,''' <PERSON> Macieko </PERSON> said in court papers. <PERSON> Welsch </PERSON> then agreed to give <PERSON> Macieko </PERSON> and <PERSON> Salenga </PERSON> a cut of the prize, he said. <PERSON> Macieko </PERSON> said that at first, he accepted a share of the prize, because he feared that `` if I did n't accept the offer as proposed, I would get nothing.'' But in his suit, he argues that he and his fiancee should get the whole amount. The Welsches denied any wrongdoing, saying that the story told at the news conference is the true one. `` Macieko is a greedy S.O.B.,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Welsch </PERSON>. `` Those two are trying to horn in and get a greater part of the share.'' The first of 20 yearly prize checks was to be sent this week, but the court ordered the distribution of the money postponed while the case is pending.

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Parliament and state-run media today criticized a resolution passed by the Polish parliament condemning the 1968 Soviet-led invasion of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. The government said Thursday it will come down hard on any protests Monday marking the 21st anniversary of the invasion that crushed the brief reform period known as `` Prague Spring.'' In its reaction to the Polish parliament's vote Thursday, the presidium of the Czechoslovak parliament said it `` is taken aback by these declarations which ... are a gross interference in internal affairs of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and categorically rejects them.'' The resolution adopted by the Polish <ORGANIZATION> Sejm </ORGANIZATION>, the lower house of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, said the Soviet-led invasion `` violated every nation's inalienable right to self-determination and its natural desire for democracy, freedom and respect of human rights.'' On Tuesday, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> said its `` present leadership ... does not concur with the 1968 military intervention in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'' but that assessing the event `` should be the right and task of the Czechoslovak people and the <ORGANIZATION> Czechoslovak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>.'' The 1968 invasion crushed a short-lived liberalization period spearheaded by then <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>, who was ousted in April 1969. Communist <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, meanwhile, strongly defended the invasion. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> German </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily newspaper, claimed that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> led `` imperialist forces'' trying to influence Czechoslovak affairs in the days before the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact invasion. The newspaper commentary reiterated the hard line <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has adhered to while allied <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> have introduced economic and social reforms and begun a reassessment of their pasts. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has resisted the reforms advocated by Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, and it has given little attention in the state-run media to the democratic advances sweeping <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 A 26-year-old man who confessed to the brutal slayings of three young girls that terrorized a suburban <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> neighborhood said he also kidnapped and killed a fourth girl, a newspaper said today. The deaths of the four girls have deeply shocked <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, and Prime Minister <PERSON> Toshiki </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> and other government officials today urged police to fully investigate the string of murders. <PERSON> Tsutomu </PERSON> <PERSON> Miyazaki </PERSON>, a printing shop assistant, recently admitted under police questioning that he killed <PERSON> Masami </PERSON> <PERSON> Yoshizawa </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Asahi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION> newspaper quoted police as saying. <PERSON> Miyazaki </PERSON> confessed he had kidnapped and killed <PERSON> Masami </PERSON>, age 7, and `` buried her in the mountains,'' <ORGANIZATION> Asahi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Masami </PERSON> has been missing since October, when she left her home in <LOCATION> Saitama </LOCATION> prefecture, north of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, to play. A <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> official declined to comment on the reports. <PERSON> Miyazaki </PERSON> is under arrest for kidnapping and killing 5-year-old <PERSON> Ayako </PERSON> <PERSON> Nomoto </PERSON>. On Sunday, two days after his arrest, he also confessed that he had kidnapped and killed two other girls, <PERSON> Mari </PERSON> <PERSON> Konno </PERSON> and <PERSON> Erika </PERSON> <PERSON> Namba </PERSON>, both age 4, police officials said. In a country with remarkably little crime, the killings and <PERSON> Miyazaki </PERSON>'s confessions have received extensive media coverage. Television stations have shown pictures of the inside of his home, filled from floor to ceiling with comic books and about 4,500 videos, including many animated films. Viewers also have heard his former co-workers, teachers and school mates, neighbors, parents of victims and handwriting analysts comment on the cruelty of the murders. But some people have criticized the reporting for going too far. In its current issue, the liberal weekly magazine <ORGANIZATION> Asahi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> said that competition among the media had been excessive. <PERSON> Miyazaki </PERSON> was handed over to prosecutors Sunday. Under Japanese law, prosecutors have a maximum of 20 days to collect evidence against him before releasing him or bringing formal charges.

4th graf pvs, ``Military reviews...''</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has scrapped plans to mark its 40th National Day with a military parade, according to official reports, in an apparent move to avoid reminding people of the crackdown on the pro-democracy movement. In another development, <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> sources said President <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Shangkun </PERSON>, a central figure in the June crackdown, had ordered the defense minister and several commanders detained to strengthen his control of the military. National Day marks the establishment of communist rule in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. This year's celebrations, scheduled for Oct. 1, were to have been the most elaborate in five years. Military reviews, held annually from 1949 to 1959, were suspended for 25 years. When they were revived in 1984, the reviews were to have been part of National Day celebrations every five years. But <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> <PERSON> Xitong </PERSON> said Thursday no parade was planned this year. He gave no reason, but his decision came two months after the government dispatched troops and tanks to crush the seven-week democracy movement. <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> has been under martial law since May 20, and troops armed with assault rifles have guarded the city since the crackdown began June 3-4. The government says 200 people were killed when soldiers marched on <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. Chinese witnesses and Western intelligence reports say up to 3,000 people died. <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> said National Day flower displays will be set up again this year in <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, the site of the student-led pro-democracy demonstrations, but that only organized groups would be allowed in. Fireworks, parties, sports events and theatrical performances are planned at parks, gymnasiums and theaters throughout the city, he said. In 1984, <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> celebrated National Day with a day of festivities in the square, including a 1,200-piece military band, 18 formations of foot soldiers and 24 formations of military equipment including anti-tank missiles, rocket mine-laying vehicles and artillery. A civilian parade included 140,000 people. In the military power struggle, soldiers loyal to <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> went to the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> residence of Defense Minister <PERSON> Qin </PERSON> <PERSON> Jiwei </PERSON> on Wednesday and took him and one of his armed guards away, said the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> sources, who demanded anonymity. The sources contacted The Associated Press separately. One is a military officer who telephoned <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> Thursday morning from <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, and the other is a businessman, based in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, who says he has extensive contacts within the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> military. A <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official said today he knew nothing about the reports. Other offices in the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> did not answer their telephones today. <PERSON> Qin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> have been competing to become first vice chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s top military body. The post was left vacant by the dismissal of <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON> on June 24 after he expressed sympathy for the pro-democracy demonstrators. Other troops detained the heads of the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guangzhou </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nanjing </LOCATION> military districts, who supported <PERSON> Qin </PERSON>, the sources said.

<HEAD>Press Publishes Trotsky Letters Criticizing Communist Party</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Soviet press has published letters <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Trotsky </PERSON> wrote more than 60 years ago criticizing the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the latest step toward improving the image of the late party leader. In its August edition, the monthly youth journal <PERSON> Molodoi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kommunist </PERSON> published several letters <PERSON> Trotsky </PERSON> wrote in the 1920s complaining about the party bureaucracy. `` There is a tendency toward a greater and greater contradiction between a few thousand people in command and the rest of the party members,'' <PERSON> Trotsky </PERSON> wrote in a 1923 letter that appeared in Pravda that year. The criticism is particularly relevant now as the party tries to halt a loss of prestige and faith among the citizenry. President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has called for a `` renewal'' of the 20 million-member party. As <PERSON> Trotsky </PERSON> did a half-century ago, many Soviets now blame the party bureaucracy for impeding reform. Because of that criticism and other differences, dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> ordered <PERSON> Trotsky </PERSON> ousted from the party in 1927 and exiled him two years later. <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> had his foe killed in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> in 1940. <PERSON> Trotsky </PERSON> was close to Soviet founder <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> and helped direct the 1917 coup that brought the <ORGANIZATION> Bolsheviks </ORGANIZATION> to power. He was branded an enemy when <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> took over. In November 1987, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> became the first Soviet leader in decades to mention <PERSON> Trotsky </PERSON> publicly but condemned his call for world revolution. Since then, Pravda has published an article acknowledging the key role <PERSON> Trotsky </PERSON> played in the Russian Revolution and Civil War. Officials have so far taken the stance that <PERSON> Trotsky </PERSON>'s views were wrong and his full rehabilitation soon is unlikely. In the letters reprinted in <PERSON> Molodoi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kommunist </PERSON>, <PERSON> Trotsky </PERSON> said democracy was impossible to achieve in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> but `` at the same time, absolute centralism is incompatible with the nature of the mass party.''

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> took an ocean spin in his speed boat today as he interspersed relaxation with updates on political developments in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. Under bright, sunny skies, the president went by car to nearby <LOCATION> Biddeford </LOCATION> where the power boat, <ORGANIZATION> Fidelity </ORGANIZATION>, was tied up in a yacht harbor. Accompanied by local fishing buddy <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Boilard </PERSON>, sons <PERSON> George </PERSON> and <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> and the wife of his other son, <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON>, the president sped out to sea, trailed by <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agents in other boats. He cheerily waved off reporters' attempts to engage him in conversation. `` Photo op,'' he said, referring to his rule about not answering questions at occasions where he wants to be photographed only. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Thursday vowed to play golf every day until returning to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Sept. 4. Officials said the president was monitoring the moves that could lead to a non-communist government in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> but was n't directly involved in phone conversations with Polish or other East bloc leaders. On the first full day of his three-week vacation, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> passed up an opportunity to respond directly to news that Polish President <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> had approved Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s plan for a coalition government However, administration officials privately were enthusiastic. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was on the golf course when reporters asked his reaction to the developments in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. `` No comment,'' he replied. But the president was in a jovial mood as he raced around the 18 holes of a local course with his son, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, and club pro <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Raynor </PERSON>. When reporters ran into a blank wall on the <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> issue, they asked how his vacation was going. `` Now we're talking,'' the president replied. Vowing that he would play golf every day before he returns to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> joked to the accompanying pool of reporters, `` You guys mind coming with us?'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was surrounded at <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION> by numerous offspring and grandchildren as well as his wife, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>, at the family home on <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>'s Point. He went boating on the ocean and played tennis under picture-perfect bright sunny skies. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his advisers were said to be pleased at the apparent trend in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, but were choosing their words cautiously. White House Press Secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the administration did n't want to `` upset the apple cart.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was briefed on the Polish developments by <ORGANIZATION> Deputy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> Adviser <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON>, who accompanied him to <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>. `` Two years ago, no one in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would have predicted this could happen,'' said a senior administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity. `` Of course we're happy, extremely happy.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who voiced strong support for recent political reforms during his trip to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> last month, was not endorsing <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> or any other candidate. `` It is a sensitive situation there in terms of the general movement away from the communist control,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> discussed the possibility of <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> becoming prime minister when the two had lunch in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> last month, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> has voiced reservations this week about accepting the post. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> `` talked about the political process and the prospects and about <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s personal feelings about his role,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` The president understands the various pressures that are on Mr. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and he -LRB- <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> -RRB- is very concerned about the new government, about Solidarity's ability to step in and take over the new government.''

 Poles are excited by stunning changes that could lead to a non-communist government nearly eight years after a martial law crackdown, and they hope the transition will revive the nation's collapsing economy. Even in June, when the freest Polish elections in 40 years were held, it would have been hard to believe the independent Solidarity movement would do so well that it would force the first non-communist government in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc. A 20-year-old Catholic university student said she was surprised at the historic changes that took place during her vacation the last two weeks. `` I did n't expect all this when going for a holiday,'' she said Thursday. `` The elections were only two months ago. ... But the abundance of events is so great, out of proportion to the calendar,'' added a middle-age man who was out with his dog. The young woman's homecoming and the man's evening walk were the routine events of a day during which the seemingly inconceivable had occurred. President <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>, a Communist, was reported Thursday to have agreed to nominate a prime minister from Solidarity, the trade union he sought to crush with martial law in 1981. A government official today said <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>'s choice was <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>, a journalist and longtime Solidarity activist. The continuing influence of the opposition union had shown the world that the course of communism could be challenged, albeit as much from the pressure of a national economic crisis as from arguments about democracy. For the first time in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc, the communists appear to be on the verge of turning over the power to form a government. `` Now those who were under the wagon are on it,'' Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> told the West German <ORGANIZATION> ZDF </ORGANIZATION> television network after his historic meeting with <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> Thursday. But in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>'s streets during the sultry summer evening, surprise was tempered by a nearly exhausted faith in government. `` The point is not who it is going to be, as long as it is a person who pulls us out from the pit,'' said a middle-age bookstore worker waiting for the tram home. `` We want people who would care for the good of the country. We do n't care whether it is Solidarity, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> or some other. The point is to get us out of this pit,'' said a retired teacher a half-mile away at the central train station. His daughter-in-law spoke for others absorbed in dealing with daily difficulties posed by inflation and shortages. `` One leads such a monotonous way of life _ home, work, family, children, lines _ that one does not have time to be interested in politics,'' she said. But she added, `` I think this is a great prospect of something new.''

 Scientists smashed an F-4 Phantom jet into a concrete barrier to try to estimate what would happen if a plane crashed into a nuclear reactor. Researchers at the <ORGANIZATION> Sandia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> said they hope the information gathered from the 1988 test could help prevent a nuclear disaster. `` The crash data are going to give us an unprecedented ability to predict the impact force when an aircraft crashes into a building,'' said <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Riesemann </PERSON>, supervisor of <ORGANIZATION> Sandia </ORGANIZATION>'s containment technology division. `` We'd previously done some fairly accurate computer analysis, but the computer models were untried on the real thing. Not anymore.'' The test was conducted at the lab's rocket sled facility just south of <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION> in April 1988. The rocket-propelled F-4 smashed head-on into a 1 million-pound concrete barrier. It shattered when it hit the 23-foot-square, 12-foot-thick reinforced concrete block at 480 mph. Details of the test were reported Thursday during the 10th International Conference on Structural Mechanics in Reactor Technology at <LOCATION> Anaheim </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Sandia </ORGANIZATION> officials said. Researchers need to estimate in detail the structural response of a building if an airplane crashed or was rammed into it. To do that they must know how the impact force changes throughout the brief time the crash is in progress, <ORGANIZATION> Sandia </ORGANIZATION> officials said. In the past, engineers estimated the force of aircraft impacts by analyzing the durability and mass of aircraft, then calculating how much force a plane might exert on a building. The F-4 test showed that computer calculations were fairly accurate, although they tended to overestimate the force of impact, <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Riesemann </PERSON> said. The plane, filled with more than 1,200 gallons of water to simulate the weight of fuel, was shot along rails by a two-stage rocket. It was held in a special carriage to prevent it from taking off as it hurtled forward into the barrier. The crash was recorded by 16 high-speed cameras that shot from 500 to 2,000 frames per second, and by meters that measured the impact. The test was paid for by the <ORGANIZATION> Muto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Structural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mechanics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> and was performed at <LOCATION> Sandia </LOCATION> under a joint <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States-Japanese </ORGANIZATION> agreement for cooperation on nuclear safety engineering and research. The test was not announced until Thursday at the request of the Japanese sponsors, lab officials said.

<HEAD>Former Czech Official Says Polish Developments Pose Potential Danger</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A leader of the 1968 Czechoslovak reformist movement said today that <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s political situation is changing so quickly it could get out of control and threaten <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc reforms. <PERSON> Zdenek </PERSON> <PERSON> Mlynar </PERSON> made his comments on Austrian state radio after reports that <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s president, <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>, had agreed to name a representative of the Solidarity trade union to lead the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc's first non-communist government. <PERSON> Mlynar </PERSON> lauded the recent decisions in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> as opening `` a new stage in the reform development'' in the Soviet bloc but said they hold `` a -LRB- potentially -RRB- dangerous development. `` Here you come close to the limit of what ... <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s reform politics can still tolerate,'' he said. In 1968, <PERSON> Mlynar </PERSON> was a <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> secretary in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> and a close associate of the party chief, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>, who supported the Prague Spring reform movement, was ousted after a Soviet-led invasion crushed the movement. <PERSON> Mlynar </PERSON> is now an Austrian citizen and works as a political scientist. He frequently has acted as a political analyst of developments in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. He said the situation in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> might get out of control and grow into a `` foreign policy problem, not only for <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> but also for the West, for <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> politics as a whole.'' `` This is why one has to make sure that the -LRB- Polish -RRB- development does not threaten the basic direction of the new Soviet foreign policy,'' <PERSON> Mlynar </PERSON> said. `` What might get out of control is, above all, the ... dissatisfaction of the masses,'' <PERSON> Mlynar </PERSON> said in the interview. He suggested that failure to improve the economy in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> might result in problems the Solidarity government would be unable to control.

 The only passenger vessel that serves the Christian heartland came under Syrian fire at the port of <LOCATION> Jounieh </LOCATION> north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> today and fled back to its home port in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, police said. Police said three people were killed and 21 wounded in artillery duels between army commander Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s 20,000 predominantly Christian troops and the more than 40,000 Syrian and allied forces. The incidents came during a fragile lull in fighting following a Tuesday appeal for a cease-fire by the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> capital, President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>, King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> planned to meet to discuss renewing <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> efforts to bring peace to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. A police spokesman, who can not be identified in line with standing regulations, said Syrian gunners fired about 120 rockets from multibarreled launchers at the hydrofoil <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Maria </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Jounieh </LOCATION>, 12 -LCB- miles north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Police said seven passengers waiting to board the ship were wounded during the shelling. In the <LOCATION> Cypriot </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION>, a spokesman for the ship's agents said the vessel's crew was unable to unload the baggage of the 120 passengers who went to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` The heavy shelling meant the boat had to leave immediately,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Mansour </PERSON>. For the past three months the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Maria </LOCATION> has been the only passenger vessel connecting the 310-square-mile beleaguered Christian enclave northeast of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> with the outside world. In May, slower passenger ferry operators decided it was too dangerous to continue sailing to <LOCATION> Jounieh </LOCATION>. By police count, the 5-month-old confrontation between Christian and Moslem forces has killed 778 people and wounded 2,092. All but 150,000 of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s 1.5 million residents have fled the bomb-ravaged city. Iraqi officials said the meeting in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> was called to revive faltering Arab mediation to end the fighting and find a settlement to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 14-year-old civil war. The current round of fighting broke out March 8 after <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> blockaded illegal ports operated by <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s militia allies south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in an abortive bid to restore state authority. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and its allies retaliated by besieging the Christian enclave, where about 1 million people live. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s main Arab rival, has been arming <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s forces to thwart Syrian ambitions in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The Syrians say <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> is vital to their security and have long considered it part of `` Greater <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has supported <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s demand the Syrians withdraw the 40,000 troops they have in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> under a 1976 Arab League peacekeeping mandate. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> says the Syrians have betrayed that mandate by fighting alongside the Moslems. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> has been feuding with Syrian President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> since 1983 over control of the Palestinian cause. <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, which reconciled with <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> two years ago after a lengthy rift, is allied with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> in the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. Meanwhile, French envoy <PERSON> Alain </PERSON> <PERSON> Decaux </PERSON> held talks with <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> in the general's bunker under the shell-battered presidential palace in suburban <LOCATION> Baabda </LOCATION>, east of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Decaux </PERSON>, who arrived in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> Thursday, refused to talk to reporters about his mission. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, which ruled <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> until 1943 and has long been seen by the Christians as their main protector, has begun a new diplomatic initiative to secure a cease-fire.

In <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, the Doles will deliver letters from President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to Polish President <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> and Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is vacationing, White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the letters were `` letters of greeting'' from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and the government leaders in the countries the Doles are visiting. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the letters merely conveyed the president's best wishes and were not policy oriented. The couple is also scheduled to visit earthquake-torn <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, where they will deliver relief and rehabilitation supplies furnished by Project Hope, a private charitable organization.

<TEXT>
 Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> was booed and followed down the street by a pack of screaming senior citizens as he left a meeting with community leaders opposed to his stance on federal health insurance. Several dozen people shouted `` Liar!'' `` Impeach!'' and `` Recall!'' Thursday, when the Democratic chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> left a community center in the <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> district that for 30 years has sent him to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The group followed him down the street and briefly blocked his car, hitting it with picket signs and pounding on the windows. <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> got out of the car and briskly walked about a block, with the seniors in pursuit, until the driver brought the car to a gas station and the congressman was able to get back in. The car sped away with its tires screeching. As he walked down the street, <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> said, `` I do n't think they understand what's going on. That's too bad.'' The incident occurred after <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> discussed his support for the catastrophic health care law during a private, 90-minute meeting with representatives of six senior citizens organizations. The law set up a supplemental insurance medical plan for senior citizens and has triggered objections because it requires seniors to pay a surtax on their income taxes for the coverage. In response to complaints, <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>'s committee last month approved revisions in the program that would reduce the surtax for many of the elderly, but would increase it for some lower-income elderly. <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> refused to stop and talk to a larger group of people after the meeting because he felt many of them `` just wanted to vent their frustration, not talk about the issues,'' an aide said. `` They were just going to boo him,'' the aide said. The congressman left the meeting and made his way through 200 people outside the private meeting room. Some followed him to the street. `` Talk to us! Talk to us! You work for us!'' they yelled. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Prete </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION>, said the meeting with senior representatives id n't go well, either. He said <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> was n't receptive to suggestions made during the session. `` We think this man is inhumane,'' said <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON>, 67, who was part of the gathering outside the building. `` He's not answering the questions or needs of the people. Is he afraid of senior citizens?'' The catastrophic coverage law requires most of the elderly to pay a surtax on their income taxes for coverage. It was intended as a way of shielding the elderly from the rocketing medical bills of a major illness. But opponents complain that it requires middle-income retirees to pay unusually high tax rates. If the <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> proposals to revise the program are approved by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the president, the surtax would be reduced for many elderly taxpayers. But for an elderly couple with an income of $ 15,000 to $ 20,000, the annual cost for catastrophic insurance would go up. <PERSON> Prete </PERSON> said members of his group believe they should not have to pay any premium, arguing that farmers get bailouts, savings and loans are rescued, and those and others benefiting from government fix-its do n't pay extra taxes. `` Why should senior citizens as a single group be taxed at a higher rate?'' he said.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is not considering expanding the $ 119 million economic aid package he has proposed for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> despite the non-communist government taking shape in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc nation, his spokesman said today. Asked in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is vacationing, whether the changes in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> would justify more financial incentives, presidential press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters: `` It's really premature to think along those lines. He also said he administration would have no comment on reports of the selection of <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>, editor of the newspaper of the independent trade union Solidarity, as the new prime minister until the parliamentary process is completed and the new leaders are ratified. `` The situation is changing rapidly there,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` We would prefer not to have any further comment on the process until we have some assurances on how the government is going to be formed.'' Meeting last month with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, Solidarity chairman <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Welesa </PERSON> asked for $ 10 billion in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to rebuild the Polish economy, which is saddled with a $ 39 billion debt to Western governments and banks. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> responded with the $ 119 million package that will include $ 100 million over three years for loans to Poles trying to start capitalist enterprises; $ 5 million to clean pollution in <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION> and $ 4 million to be spent through the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to study social and work issues in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. Labor Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and her husband, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republican leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, left <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> today on a 10-day trip that wil include meetings with officials in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> next week. Sen. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said, `` I think right now it's a time of great excitement and expectations. But I do believe that if you look at it realistically, there are some tough days ahead.'' <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said Thursday that the administration was still drafting proposed legislation on the president's aid package for presentation to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> when it returns from recess next month. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> on Thursday described the political change in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> as `` a sensitive situation there in terms of the general movement away from the communist control.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> does not want `` to do anything or say anything to upset the apple cart. ... We're very reluctant to involve ourselves in a more direct fashion,'' he said. `` Certainly a non-communist government would be a remarkable and history-making occurrence,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. But one senior administration official described the mood as jubilant. `` Two years ago, no one in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would have predicted this could happen. Of course we're happy, extremely happy,'' said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. `` These changes are the most important upheavals in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and in the Soviet world since the death of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Zbigniew </PERSON> <PERSON> Brzezinski </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> who was former President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s national security adviser, said today on `` CBS This Morning. `` And they have enormous implications for the future of communism and the <LOCATION> East-West </LOCATION> relations. ... We are seeing the end of an entire era.'' <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> issued a statement clearly designed to warn the Kremlin not to invoke the <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> doctrine, used in the past to justify the use of force to prevent assertion of greater independence by <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. `` <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> faces a difficult period of transition from a state dominated by one party to a more pluralistic and democratic system. The process must be managed within <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said. `` We emphasize that this continues to be a matter for the Polish people to decide,'' he said. Asked whether his statement was aimed at <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> would say only: `` You know as well as I do what the history of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> is.'' One specialist on Soviet affairs predicted <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> would `` grin and bear'' the formation of a non-communist government in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, unless he chose to jeopardize his own reforms and efforts to improve relations with the West. `` The test of how far <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is willing to let things go in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> has come earlier than anyone expected,'' said <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aron </PERSON>, a scholar of Soviet affairs at the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. But as long <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> does not humiliate <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s communists or try to withdraw from the Kremlin-led <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> military alliance, `` <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> may have to grin and bear it,'' <PERSON> Aron </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> also realizes that any attempt at stopping these developments in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> would mean violence, major threat to East-West relations and ultimately, probably, he would dig his own grave within the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Brzezinski </PERSON>. Polish emigres were less confident. `` It seems to be too good to be true,'' said <PERSON> Zdislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Rurarz </PERSON>, who defected from his post as Polish ambassador to <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> when communist authorities declared martial law and suppressed Solidarity on Dec. 13, 1981. `` I can not imagine that the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.S.R. </ORGANIZATION> has abandoned <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and is ready to end its domination of that country,'' <PERSON> Rurarz </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` All depends on the reaction from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Nowak </PERSON>, an emigre Pole who fought the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> and the communists for control of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> before fleeing his homeland after World War II.

 A man just out of jail for child abuse held his wife and eight children hostage for more than six hours, terrorizing them by playing Russian roulette, before killing the woman and himself, police said. The children, between 1 and 13 years old, were safe after Thursday's standoff. The gunman, <PERSON> Dang </PERSON> <PERSON> Cha </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiong </PERSON>, a Laotian refugee, died about two hours later at a hospital. His wife, <PERSON> Bao </PERSON> <PERSON> Cha </PERSON>, died at the scene. A ninth child, a 12-year-old boy, had escaped from the apartment and alerted police that <PERSON> Dang </PERSON> was holding the nine hostages. The boy who escaped, and one of the eight children held hostage, were both family friends, while the other seven children were <PERSON> Dang </PERSON>'s children, authorities said. The boy said <PERSON> Dang </PERSON> was playing Russian roulette with his hostages, sticking a bullet in the cylinder of his .38 - caliber revolver and pulling the trigger at random, said Lt. <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> Police spoke with <PERSON> Dang </PERSON> for several hours and he sounded cooperative, said <PERSON> Lucian </PERSON> <PERSON> Neely </PERSON>, deputy police chief. But after <PERSON> Dang </PERSON> said he would surrender and lay down his gun, police heard four shots. Officers rushed the apartment and found the children in a front room and the two wounded parents in a rear bedroom. Police fired no shots during the siege, <PERSON> Neely </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dang </PERSON>, 35, had been involved in a longstanding feud with his wife's parents, <PERSON> Neely </PERSON> said. He previously had been arrested and convicted for child abuse, Sgt. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanford </PERSON> said. He had been released from jail Thursday morning. Officers said a court order had restrained him from visiting the family apartment in the <LOCATION> Tyrolean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> district north of the downtown where many refugees from <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> live.

 Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> and East German leader <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> have agreed to high-level negotiations to deal with a crush of East German refugees at West German embassies, officials said today. <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> government spokesman <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmuelling </PERSON> told reporters <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> received a letter from <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> on Thursday night in reply to a West German letter earlier this week pressing for joint efforts in the refugee situation. A meeting between <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> and <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> has not been ruled out, but government sources said the talks would likely be handled by other senior authorities. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said in a television interview today he was prepared to meet with <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> personally, if necessary to ease the `` strained'' ties between the two countries. <PERSON> Schmuelling </PERSON> refused to say what <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>'s letter said but confirmed that a meeting of East and West German officials `` at a high level'' was in the works. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s chief of staff, <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Seiters </PERSON>, arrived in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> today, according to reporters there. Government sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said <PERSON> Seiters </PERSON> would meet with East German Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Krolikowski </PERSON> to discuss the refugee problem. More than 300 East Germans seeking to emigrate are being sheltered at <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s embassies in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>. The Foreign Ministry closed its embassy in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> on Monday because the refugees had overwhelmed the facility. Another 300 or more East Germans have arrived since the gates were locked and have taken shelter with international aid groups at churches and temporary encampments. East Germans frustrated with the lack of reform in their Communist-governed country have been pouring out by the hundreds this summer through neighboring <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, which began dismantling its barbed-wire border with <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> in May. Most of those holed up at <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>'s embassies in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> are East Germans who were caught trying to escape to <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. Hungarian border guards have noted the failed escape attempts in the passports of many of those caught, and East Germans fearing punishment if they return home have appealed to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> for help.

 Highly successful trials of the antiviral drug AZT suggest that AIDS may soon become `` a treatable disease'' instead of a hopeless infection, federal officials say. The announcement is `` a major turning point in the AIDS epidemic,'' said <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> AIDS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, an advocacy group for AIDS patients. <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> announced Thursday that trials of AZT on one group of patients who have the AIDS virus, but no symptoms, proved that the drug can halt progression of the infection. `` We are indeed entering the period when AIDS may become a treatable disease,'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said at a news conference where the AZT drug trial results were announced. However, he cautioned: `` AZT is not a cure and, indeed, even those who are under AZT treatment remain capable of transmitting the disease.'' Findings of the drug trials on early-infected patients who show no symptoms prompted federal officials to stop the trials so that all participants can receive AZT. The drug trial had required one-third of the 1,300 in the study to receive a placebo, or sugar pill. Patients in the trial were in the early stages of infection by the human immunedeficiency virus, or HIV, that causes AIDS. In effect, they were feeling well and were symptom-free, but they had a damaged immune system as measured by the numbers of T4 lymphocytes, a type of immune cells, in the blood. An AZT trial continues for patients in an even earlier stage of infection and with even less immune system damage. AZT, also known as zidovudine, is marketed by <ORGANIZATION> Burroughs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wellcome </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> under the brand name Retrovir. It formally was known by the name azidothymidine, which was shortened in popular use to AZT. Thursday's announcement marks the third time that formal trials of AZT have been modified after the drug demonstrated its effectiveness against AIDS in selected patient groups. Two weeks ago, a trial was stopped among patients with a stage of the disease called AIDS-related complex, or ARC. Earlier, the government halted trials among profoundly infected AIDS patients. In both cases the trials were stopped so that those participants getting placebo could start receiving the drug. An AZT trial continues among AIDS patients whose blood immune system is still healthy but who test positive for infection by the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, which causes AIDS. This group would be at an even earlier stage of the disease. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said the new trial results, along with those from the two earlier trials, provide `` real hope for the millions of people worldwide who are infected with HIV.'' Ms. <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON> said in a prepared statement, `` For the millions of Americans who have waited to be tested for HIV because there was no medical assistance available, today's announcement should be reason for people to rethink that decision.'' The <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> secretary said he is ordering that <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> patients receiving AZT be reimbursed for the cost of the drug. AZT, which must be taken six times daily, costs $ 7,000 to $ 8,000 a year per patient. Dr. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Fauci </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Allergy </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Infectious </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diseases </ORGANIZATION>, the lead federal clinical agency in fighting AIDS, said that with Thursday's announcement about 400,000 more patients may be prescribed AZT. Even though the drug is not approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> for use among mildly infected patients, it could be prescribed for such patients at doctors' discretion, he said. The earlier trials opened use of the drug to about 200,000 patients, making a total of 600,000 who may now take AZT, <PERSON> Fauci </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> will consider the new drug trial results and may modify the approved uses of AZT to include those mildly infected. This action, however, could take months, he said. In the study concluded Thursday, one-third of the patients received 1,500 milligrams daily of AZT, a third took 500 mg daily and a third got sugar pills. The study was conducted at 32 centers in 16 states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fauci </PERSON> said the results showed that among those taking the placebo, 38 patients developed symptoms of AIDS or of <ORGANIZATION> ARC </ORGANIZATION>. Among those on high doses of AZT, 19 developed the disease symptoms, and among those on the low doses, 17 developed symptoms. `` This is a very important step in the scientific certification of what we had been hoping for,'' <PERSON> Fauci </PERSON> said. `` We're not talking about a cure, but we're talking about a very important step in delaying the progression of the disease.'' Acquired immune deficiency syndrome attacks the body's immune system and renders it incapable of protecting against infection. The disease is caused by the HIV virus and is spread most frequently through sexual contact, the sharing of needles and syringes, and from mother to newborn infant. New figures released Thursday by the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> show there have been 102,621 cases of AIDS diagnosed in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since 1981. A total of 59,391 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> patients have died. There is no cure for AIDS and no one is known to have recovered completely from the viral infection.

 President <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> has chosen Solidarity activist <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> to be the new prime minister and lead the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc's first non-communist government, a government source said today. `` I can expect such an offer. I am ready to accept it,'' <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> told reporters after meeting with <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> this morning. A highly placed state official said that during the meeting, <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> chose <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> from three Solidarity-backed candidates and would offer him the prime minister's post. The Sejm, or parliament, where a Solidarity-backed alliance has a firm majority, must approve <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>'s choice. <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>, 62, whose name is pronounced mah-zoh-vee-ET-skee, is a journalist who spent time in jail for his anti-government activities. He refused to give details of his meeting with the president, saying only that it concerned `` all important topics.'' `` There are huge troubles, huge problems. It wo n't be easy,'' <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> said of the prime minister's post. `` I am afraid of many things, but if I were only afraid, I would be a total pessimist. Somebody has to try it.'' The new government will be the first non-communist government in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in 45 years and inherits an economy wracked by inflation, shortages and a $ 39 billion foreign debt. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said today President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was not considering increasing the $ 119 million economic aid package proposed for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, despite the non-communist government taking shape. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration would not comment on the new prime minister until the nomination was ratified. There was no immediate comment from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, which has expressed concern about the changes in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> but promised not to interfere. The Polish government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said a formal announcement on <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>'s choice would be made Saturday. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> also is scheduled to meet Saturday. <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> is editor of the Solidarity weekly newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Tygodnik </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Solidarnosc </ORGANIZATION>. The other candidates recommended by Solidarity were <PERSON> Jacek </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuron </PERSON>, a Solidarity lawmaker, and <PERSON> Bronislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Geremek </PERSON>, Solidarity's parliamentary leader. The once inconceivable idea of a government without a <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> member at the helm became possible after Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> persuaded two small parties that hold the balance of power in the <ORGANIZATION> Sejm </ORGANIZATION> to join Solidarity in a coalition. That resulted in the communist alliance losing its majority in the Sejm. On Thursday, the Communist prime minister, Gen. <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON>, resigned after trying two weeks to form a government. The same day, <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, reportedly agreed to the coalition idea and agreed to pick a member of the trade union he once outlawed to lead it. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, who in April realized his goal of reviving Solidarity after a seven-year ban, had said he did not want the job. Even in a government led by Solidarity, <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> will remain president, controlling the army and foreign affairs; local governments will still be in the hands of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>; and party members will control the courts. In addition, tens of thousands of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s bureaucrats owe their jobs to the party, and 75 percent of management jobs _ ranging from shop managers to factory heads _ are held by party members. <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> was the least known of the candidates put forward by <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, but his relation to Solidarity dates to the first days of the August 1980 strikes in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> that gave birth to the trade union. He organized a petition of support among intellectuals for the strikers, than stayed on with the workers as an adviser. <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> was at <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s side last year when a wave of strikes began and led to government-opposition talks on democratic reforms. Those talks ended in Solidarity being legalized again and led to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s most democratic elections, which allowed Solidarity to enter government. In the June vote, Solidarity-backed candidates swept all but one seat available to the opposition in the <ORGANIZATION> Sejm </ORGANIZATION> and newly formed <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The accord guaranteed the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> a majority, but it lost the upper hand when its traditional allies, the Democratic and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peasant </ORGANIZATION> parties, defected to Solidarity this week. In an apparent effort to reassure <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> allies, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> Thursday reiterated his view that <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s membership in the Soviet-led alliance was not in jeopardy. Under his proposal, the communists should retain control of the defense and interior ministries, which oversee the army and police. `` We are members of the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact and therefore have certain responsibilities,'' he told West German television. Back in 1980, the creation of Solidarity, the Soviet bloc's first independent trade union, unnerved the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, then ruled by <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>. The union was legal for 16 months and had swelled to 10 million members when martial law was declared Dec. 13, 1981. Thousands of union supporters were jailed, and <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> banned Solidarity the next year. Before Solidarity, <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> was active in independent <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> circles helped found the Club of <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligentsia </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> in 1957. He was part of the <ORGANIZATION> ZNAK </ORGANIZATION> group, which managed under church protection to serve as a focal point for thinking independent of communist ideology in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in the 1960s and 1970s. The group was permitted a few seats in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> held one from 1961 to 1971. <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> was editor of the Catholic literary and political monthly Wiez from 1958 until 1981 when he founded <ORGANIZATION> Tygodnik </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Solidarnosc </ORGANIZATION>. The weekly was banned after martial law but <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> resurrected it this year.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Friday it is expanding its recent ban on ostrich imports to include related flightless birds such as emus, rheas and cassowaries because they may carry disease-bearing parasites. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Slagle </PERSON>, acting administrator of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inspection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said the expanded import ban was effective immediately and would remain indefinitely. `` We must curtail the entry of flightless birds into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> until further notice to ensure that these birds do not introduce disease-carrying parasites to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> livestock,'' he said. The flightless birds affected by the ban are known as ratites and include ostriches, emus, rheas and cassowaries. These birds have only small or rudimentary wings. An agency spokeswoman, <PERSON> Marlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Stinson </PERSON>, said the import ban does not apply to penguins because those are of a different family. Neither will the ban affect kiwis, because the bird's homeland, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, does not permit exports, she said. Interest in ostrich farming has grown rapidly, and so have imports. <PERSON> Stinson </PERSON> said no ostriches were imported in 1986 but that 348 entered the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1987, 537 in 1988, and 825 through July 31 of this year. At present, sales of chicks and adult ostriches are confined primarily to other breeders, who envision a potential market for ostrich hide and meat. <PERSON> Slagle </PERSON> said the crackdown on imports was prompted by the discovery earlier this year of 18 exotic ticks on adult ostriches in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The ticks were identified as African Bont and Bont-legged ticks, which are known to transmit heartwater, an often fatal disease of cattle, sheep, goats and other ruminants. No further tick findings have been reported. <PERSON> Slagle </PERSON> said the disease does not affect humans and does not exist in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. On July 5, the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> agency announced it had stopped issuing import permits for ostriches as a result of the tick threat and was reviewing import inspection methods and quarantine standards. <PERSON> Slagle </PERSON> said the official rule-making publication of the new import curbs will be Aug. 21. Public comments can be sent by Oct. 20 to: Chief, Regulatory Analysis and Development, <ORGANIZATION> PPD </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> APHIS </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>, Room 866, <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Building </ORGANIZATION>, 6505 <LOCATION> Belcrest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hyattsville </LOCATION>, MD 20782.

 Police opened fire today on black employees outside a pie factory where they had been locked out by management. At least 15 workers were injured, police and union officials said. Police also arrested an anti-apartheid activist and banned a <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> rally called for Sunday by outlawed rights organizations. In another development, <PERSON> Trevor </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, son of Nobel Prize-winning Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, was sentenced today to 18 months in prison for allegedly making a false bomb threat at <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>'s international airport <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Valli </PERSON> <PERSON> Moosa </PERSON>, an official of the banned <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> and a leader of a new campaign to defy apartheid restrictions, was arrested at his <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> office today and held there as security police searched his files. Police ordered journalists from the building after the reporters saw <PERSON> Valli </PERSON> <PERSON> Moosa </PERSON> in custody and were told he was under arrest. There was no immediate indication what charges might be filed against <PERSON> Valli </PERSON> <PERSON> Moosa </PERSON>, one of three activists who escaped from detention last year and took sanctuary at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Consulate in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. Another escapee, <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> <PERSON> Morobe </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Valli </PERSON> <PERSON> Moosa </PERSON>'s arrest violated the government's promise that the three were free to leave the consulate without fear of being arrested again. `` It shows how easy it is for the government to go back on its word,'' said <PERSON> Morobe </PERSON>, who called on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government to condemn the arrest. The Food and <ORGANIZATION> Allied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> said scores of workers assembled early today outside the Mama's Pies factory on <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>'s southeastern outskirts, a day after the company locked them out because of a 4-week-old wage dispute. The union said police used whips and live ammunition to disperse the workers and made several arrests. The union said 15 workers were injured, some seriously. Capt. <PERSON> Reg </PERSON> <PERSON> Crewe </PERSON>, a spokesman at police headquarters in <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>, said police acted only after workers began pulling on the locked factory gates and ingored an order to disperse. He said officers initially used whips, but fired shotguns when some fleeing workers threw stones. He said four people were slightly injured by the shotgun fire and 15 others suffered minor injuries while being dispersed. He said no one was arrested. It was the second violent labor clash in two days. On Thursday, police said at least 10 people were injured outside the British-owned Eveready plant in <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Elizabeth </LOCATION> in clashes between striking workers and people recruited to fill their jobs. <LOCATION> Crewe </LOCATION>, asked about the banned <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> rally, said he did not know if similar rallies planned for Sunday in other cities also would be banned. <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> said the ban was `` inflammatory and dangerous'' and called for an alternative rally at his church in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>'s 32-year-old son, <PERSON> Trevor </PERSON>, was convicted of violating the Aviation Act by falsely telling police that there was a bomb in his luggage. He had pleaded innocent and said he would appeal the conviction. Shortly after the Dec. 31 incident at <LOCATION> Jan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Smuts </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Trevor </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> convened a news conference and told reporters he deliberately courted arrest as part of a publicity stunt on behalf of his advertising agency. He also was convicted on three counts of criminal injury and fined $ 440 for allegedly interfering with police last year when they tried to arrest a friend of his on suspicion of drunken driving. In 1984, <PERSON> Trevor </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> was held by police for three days before he was cleared of a charge of drunken driving. In 1985, he was briefly detained after arguing with police at a courthouse about the detention of black children. <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>'s father is leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Anglican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and one of the country's most prominent anti-apartheid activists. There was no immediate comment from the archbishop about his son's conviction The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, a nationwide coalition of activist organizations, and 16 other anti-apartheid groups last year were ordered to halt all activities. They intended to declare themselves legal on Sunday, the front's sixth anniversary. The rallies were organized as part of a nationwide campaign of defiance. In other phases of the campaign, blacks have sought treatment at segregated white hospitals and dozens of activists have defied restrictions imposed on them following their recent release from imprisonment.

<HEAD>U.N. Says Border Crossing Endangers Armistice Agreement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> command said Friday a border crossing at <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION> by two South Korean dissidents returning from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> threatens the armistice in effect on the divided peninsula since 1953. `` Most critically, the North Koreans' unilateral decision to allow the transit puts in question their adherence to the armistice itself,'' said a statement by the U.S.-led command, which represents nations that supported <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> in the 1950-53 war. A spokesman said the statement was intended to clarify the command's position. He did not say what action, if any, would be taken. Im Su-kyong, a raducal student, and the Rev. <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyu-hyun </PERSON> returned home Tuesday after visiting <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> illegally and were arrested immediately by South Korean authorities. The command said they crossed the border at <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION> without proper authorization. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> accused <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> of `` intentional provocation'' and using <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION> for propaganda purposes. In its statement, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> also said <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> had brought hundreds of people to the demilitarized zone for demonstrations in July and August against the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. `` The North deliberately altered the rules, thus introducing uncertainty and raising tensions in a sensitive area where the potential for confrontation and violence is always high,'' it said. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> denied the crossing was illegal. It said the armistice agreement applied only to foreigners or people wishing to enter the territory under control of the other side, and `` it is natural for Ms. Im and <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> to go back to their residence area.'' The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> says any person, military or civilian, who crosses the border must have specific authoritization from the <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armistice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> that supervises implementation of the agreement. It pointed out that many Koreans from both sides had crossed in the past by mutual agreement, but that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> had not given permission for the dissidents to do so.

<HEAD>Pardons Board Rejects Plea For Clemency in `Hi-Fi' Murder</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Note language in last graf.</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The state <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pardons </ORGANIZATION> today rejected a plea for clemency from convicted `` Hi-Fi'' murderer <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>, scheduled to die by injection early Tuesday after nearly 15 years on death row. The board's 2-1 decision left the nation's longest-standing resident of death row with pending appeals in state and federal courts of his 1974 conviction for torturing and murdering three people during a stereo store robbery in <LOCATION> Ogden </LOCATION>. In all, five people were forced to drink caustic drain cleaner and were then shot in the head; two survived the August 1974 attack. Board Chairman H.L. <PERSON> Haun </PERSON> and panel member <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Kimball </PERSON> decided that although <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> did not shoot the victims, his help in forcing them to drink the drain cleaner and his knowledge that co-defendant <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Selby </PERSON> intended to kill them made commutation of the death sentence impossible. The aggravating circumstances of the crime known as the `` Hi-Fi murders'' _ one of the most notorious in modern <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> history _ far outweighed any mitigating factors, <PERSON> Haun </PERSON> said. After the drain cleaner was administered, `` When the victims did not die quickly enough, the decision was made to shoot the victims. Mr. <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> waited outside while this took place, but he left his loaded pistol for Mr. <PERSON> Selby </PERSON> to use,'' <PERSON> Haun </PERSON> said. `` Mr. <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> knew of Mr. <PERSON> Selby </PERSON>'s intent and shared in it,'' he said. <PERSON> Selby </PERSON> was executed by injection in August 1987 after the pardons panel unanimously rejected his plea for commutation. Board member <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON> <PERSON> Palacios </PERSON> voted to commute, saying that while <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>' culpability was undeniable, `` I would commute the death sentence and recommend he never be paroled.'' <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>, 34, a <LOCATION> Jonesboro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, native, showed no emotion. While being led from the hearing room at <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prison </ORGANIZATION>, however, <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> said, `` I thank Miss Palacios for being fair and considerate.'' One of the survivors of the attack, <PERSON> Orren </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, testified at <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>' and <PERSON> Selby </PERSON>'s commutation hearings and wiped tears from his face after today's decision. His son was among those killed. Pardon Board Administrator <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheffield </PERSON> said the board received thousands of letters and telegrams from throughout the world, 90 percent of them favoring clemency. Much of the mail has stemmed from efforts of <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, which has made the case an example in its effort to abolish capital punishment. In the appeals, <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> contends his constitutional rights were violated by being forced to accept as a public defender an inexperienced attorney, and a judge's failure to instruct the jury it could convict him of second-degree murder. The appeals also raised again the argument that a mistrial should have been declared for <PERSON> Selby </PERSON> and <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>, both black, when a juror found a note bearing the words, `` Hang the niggers,'' during a lunch break. There were no blacks on the jury; the sole potential black juror was excluded.

 A <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> research program in which cats are shot in the head to study war-related brain injuries is inhumane, scientifically flawed and unnecessary, a group of doctors said.

The $ 2 million contract involves shooting hundreds of cats in the head to learn how to return brain-injured soldiers to active duty, thus conserving the fighting strength of the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Physicians </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said. According to the news release, the primary conclusion by <ORGANIZATION> LSU </ORGANIZATION> researchers is that respiration stops when the brain is wounded, a reaction the doctors said has been documented in medical literature for nearly 100 years. `` I am appalled by ` research' which purports to study human brain injury, but in fact only causes suffering in domestic cats,'' Dr. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. The physician's group is a national organization of 2,000 doctors who promote preventive medicine and alternatives to animal research. Officials from <ORGANIZATION> LSU </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> said the department head in charge of animal research was out of town and unavailable for comment.

 Five gunmen today killed a police chief who led a crackdown on drug traffickers, attacking him after he sent his bodyguards to protect court judges whose lives had been threatened. The provincial police chief, Col. <PERSON> Waldemar </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintero </PERSON>, was killed and his driver was wounded when the gunmen intercepted their car and riddled it with automatic weapon fire, authorities and witnesses said. Authorities blamed the killing on the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel, the world's largest cocaine ring which is believed responsible for about 80 percent of the cocaine smuggled into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` They fired without mercy for several minutes at the colonel, who was hit more than 100 times,'' an unidentified witness told <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caracol </ORGANIZATION>. `` His chauffer was seriously injured and taken to a hospital.'' The nation's judges went on strike Thursday to demand increased protection. They struck after gunmen hired by drug dealers killed magistrate <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Valencia </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> on Wednesday night. The killing also prompted 48 magistrates in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to hand in their resignations. <PERSON> Valencia </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, 43, had rejected court motions to exonerate two leaders of the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel who were accused in the 1987 slaying of a journalist. The defense minister, Gen. <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Botero </PERSON>, said today that soldiers and police will increase protection for judges and intensify their crackdown on the cocaine industry. He said police arrested 61 people in 100 raids this week on suspected drug processing and smuggling locations nationwide. They confiscated arms and, at a house in suburban <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, $ 7.7 million dollars in cash, gold, checks and jewelry, he said. Asked about the strike and <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintero </PERSON>'s slaying, Justice Minister <PERSON> Monica </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Grieff </PERSON> said: `` It's terrifying what is happening in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>.'' `` The only way to confront this challenge is by fighting together, the government, judges, the armed forces and the citizenry to stop the wave of violence,'' she said in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>. She appealed to the country's more than 4,000 judges and magistrates to end their strike so traffickers do n't `` achieve their goal of halting the administration of justice.'' The attack on <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintero </PERSON> occurred moments after he left home. Witnesses said <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintero </PERSON>'s car was severely damaged by the rain of gunfire and that its interior was covered with blood. <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintero </PERSON> directed the local campaign against cocaine trafficking and led several major raids that resulted in the seizure of tons of the drug and the arrest of several dealers. <PERSON> Helena </PERSON> <PERSON> Herran </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Montoya </PERSON>, the governor of <LOCATION> Antioquia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> province </LOCATION>, where <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> is located, said the colonel gave up his bodyguard force because he `` thought it was more important to use this personnel in protecting judges.'' The attack was the latest in several drug-related killings in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s second-largest city and its industrial center. In the last month, two officials investigating the activities of cocaine kingpin <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaviria </PERSON> have been slain. On Thursday night, an armed band intercepted a police van carrying 18 people who had been arrested and set them free. They included several suspected drug traffickers, officials said.

 <ORGANIZATION> MTV </ORGANIZATION> has decided to air <PERSON> Cher </PERSON>'s video `` If I Could Turn Back Time'' at night only, saying the Oscar-winning actress shows `` a little too much tush'' in the clip. `` When we accepted it, we felt it was borderline,'' <PERSON> Abbey </PERSON> <PERSON> Konowitch </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> MTV </ORGANIZATION> vice president for programming, said Friday. `` We received a great deal of negative feedback from our audience.

 Police at the original <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION> music festival arrested only about 80 people, on drug charges. At the 20th anniversary celebration, there have been four citations issued _ on tax charges.

The vendors were hawking T-shirts, hats, beads and other items to 10,000 people gathered on the site of 1969 festival. The four were charged with failure to have a certificate of authority, a misdemeanor punishable by a maximum fine of a year in jail and up to a $ 10,000 fine. <PERSON> Rickard </PERSON> said the state would dispatch three or four tax agents to the site Friday night. `` We'll be going in for the big one tonight,'' <PERSON> Rickard </PERSON> said. `` We anticipate that tonight, because of many more vendors coming, we'll be giving out more citations.

 <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Woods </PERSON>, known for his intense portrayals in such movies as `` Salvador'' and `` The Onion Field,'' has used some unusual techniques to prepare himself and his co-stars on the set. Like the time he `` whacked'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> `` across the side of the head and knocked him over, knocked his glasses across the room,'' <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> told Smart magazine in its September-October issue.

 Less than a decade ago, a burly shipyard electrican named <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> was in jail, the fledgling labor organization he founded in ruins. Today, his popularity and the stunning rebirth of the Solidarity movement have forced the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to loosen its iron grip on the government.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> strode into the <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> building, the sound of applause from opposition lawmakers filling the hall that was once a mere cog in the Communist government. Many of the Solidarity deputies who cheered him were respected politicians and scholars. But they knew they owed their political provenance to the short, stout peasant's son who never went to college. Still, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> manages to shoulder his awesome personal myth with humor and dignity. `` I never thought I could be prime minister,'' he told the lawmakers with a shake of his head the other night. They all shared a laugh. Of course he could be prime minister if he wants. One day he may be president. The Polish people, it seems, would elect him to any office in free elections. That trust in the man behind the moustache is the Polish opposition movement's greatest asset. It is the reason Communist politicians have been forced to cooperate with him. It is the lever with which he is prying power away from them. A true Polish original, his political instincts and timing have proved unerring as he has evolved from the charismatic worker leader of 1980 to the national leader and international statesman of 1989. He now appears to have pulled off what could amount to a bloodless revolution, extricating the government from Communist control after 45 years. His impact has reached into other parts of the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc. If <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s government slips out of Communist control, can <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> be far behind? How easily do party leaders in neighboring <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> rest knowing there's a <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>? Not that everybody in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> is a Walesa fan. Some in his own movement find him arrogant, accusing him of making decisions without consulting his followers. Others fault him for being too apt to compromise with a system they regard as illegitimate. This week, as his envoys were quietly coaxing longtime <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> allies to form a Solidarity-led parliamentary majority, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> came under fire from lawmakers who resented his secret dealings. Others in the chamber asked why in the bid for power Solidarity should give over two key ministries to the Communists _ the ministry of defense and the ministry of internal affairs, which controls the police. Two of his oldest associates are in opposition to him, <PERSON> Andrzej </PERSON> <PERSON> Gwiazda </PERSON>, a mentor for <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> in opposition activity in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> in the late 1970s, and <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Walentynowicz </PERSON>, the crane operator whose firing in August 1980 prompted the shipyard strike that started <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s astonishing climb to worldwide fame But many of his longtime co-conspirators in the opposition have, like <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, emerged this year as part of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s power structure and now are the senators and deputies whose faces fill the screens of state-controlled television most nights. As head of Solidarity, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> has an office and an official car _ a dented gray <PERSON> Polenez </PERSON> with a union banner afixed like an ambassador's flag. Proceeds from his autobiography have paid for the purchase of a spacious stucco house in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>, where he lives with his wife, <PERSON> Danuta </PERSON>, and their eight children. The house has a TV satellite dish in the backyard and a quiet orchard and garden where <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> tries to relax. Nevertheless, his `` Path of Hope,'' as <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> titled his autobiography last year, has not been smooth. He was born in 1943 to a poor farming family in the small village of <LOCATION> Popowo </LOCATION> in north-central <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. His father died from illness caused by forced labor under the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> when <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> was only 18 months old. After finishing technical school, where he was trained as an electrician, he fixed farm machinery before drifting to <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> in 1967 and working at the <ORGANIZATION> Lenin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipyard </ORGANIZATION>. In December 1970, when workers went on strike along the Baltic coast to protest food price increases, security forces were called in and killed scores of workers. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, a rebel disgusted by poor safety conditions in the yard, helped lead the strike there. The experience never left him and one of his first acts when Solidarity was born was to see to the erection of a monument on the square where the first victims died. In his autobiography, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> recalls how his entry into illegal trade union activities in the late 1970s kept getting him fired from various jobs and his fears that the resulting poverty and many arrests were hurting his young family. A low point came in late 1979. `` We lived from day to day, scarcely managing to make ends meet. ... I was thus faced with a dilemma: whether to withdraw from -LRB- activism -RRB- ... or whether to push on and become totally involved.'' But he said he had already crossed the `` psychological barrier'' and could not give up what he had begun. The next August, he climbed the fence at the <ORGANIZATION> Lenin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipyard </ORGANIZATION> _ where he had been fired in 1976 _ and took charge of the strike that galvanized the country. Strikers won the right to free trade unions, leading to the birth of Solidarity. But it was only the beginning of the roller coaster. Squeezed between a hostile government and a militant membership, he was constantly putting out fires. When martial law came Dec. 13, 1981, and he was imprisoned at a series of government houses, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said it meant `` a chance to rest and sleep'' after the overwhelming tension of Solidarity's 500 days of legal existance. When he was released in November 1982, there were rumors he made a deal with authorities to get out. He was cautious in his statements, saying he was on a `` greasy tightrope.'' But slowly old associates rallied around him, he recalls in his autobiography. In 1983, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. Under the pressure of a declining economy and foreign sanctions, <LOCATION> Polish </LOCATION> leader Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> lifted martial law in 1983 and freed political prisoners in a series of amnesties that culminated in 1986. Government spokesman <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Urban </PERSON> kept up a propaganda campaign against <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> over the years, saying at the start of 1988 that activists were `` weak, lost and out of touch with the masses.'' But in May 1988, strikes broke out again and the workers' chief demand was the legalization of Solidarity. A second wave of strikes in August prompted the first government talks with <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> since 1981. When the anniversary of that meeting rolls around in two weeks, Solidarity well may be in control of the government.

 A judge on Friday sentenced former <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenrette </PERSON> to 30 days in jail and fined him $ 2,000 for stealing a necktie and shoes from a discount department store. <PERSON> Jenrette </PERSON> was also put on two years probation and ordered to do 200 hours of community service. In addition, he was told to continue psychiatric and alcoholism treatment. <PERSON> Jenrette </PERSON>, 53, served 13 months in prison after he convicted in 1980 of bribery in the Abscam affair, a sting operation in which <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents poising Arab shieks and businessmen offered bribes to lawmakers. He is still on probation from that conviction. <PERSON> Jenrette </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Merril </PERSON>, said that his client would have to appear before a hearing in federal court, where authorities would then decide if he would have to serve a prison sentence for violating his parole. <ORGANIZATION> Merril </ORGANIZATION> asked <ORGANIZATION> Fairfax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> to not take into account his client's previous record in handing down the sentence. `` As the <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> suggests, I'm going to treat you just like any other shoplifter,'' <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said before the levying the punishment. <PERSON> Jenrette </PERSON> was convicted on two counts of petty larceny for switching price tags at a discount department store on Dec. 7. Two security guards from the store testified during the trial that they saw <PERSON> Jenrette </PERSON> steal the items. Before receiving his sentence, <PERSON> Jenrette </PERSON> told the judge, `` I apologize to the court. I can only say that I'll never be back. Why I let this happen, I do n't know. `` I've totally wiped out all of my income and have lost all hopes of getting my law license back.'' The former lawmaker claimed the shoplifting incident was all a mistake. He testified that he brought his own tie into the store to compare it with the one he was thinking of buying.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> vetoed what he described as an `` ill-planned ill-thought out'' plan by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agents to arrest the kingpin of the Colombian drug cartel, a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said Friday. The aborted plan to arrest <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> last fall during a trip to <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, was disclosed Thursday at a hearing of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on narcotics trafficking. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said at a briefing Friday that `` the plan to capture Mr. <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> was not coordinated with ... the appropriate <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> agencies and the embassy in <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION> and the Venezuelan government.'' `` The Department insists, as do other law enforcement agencies, on well-coordiated operations,'' <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said. `` There have been a number of well-coordinated cases which have resulted in the conviction of major traffickers, and these were the results of sound planning and good coordination. `` Such coordination insures that we advance our anti-narcotics objectives, without unecessary risks'' to government workers.

<HEAD>Congressmen Say There's Confusion on Eastern Europe Withdrawal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> congressmen said Friday that a reorganization of Soviet forces in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> is making it difficult to assess <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s promised withdrawal of 50,000 soldiers. The members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, who were ending an 11-day trip to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, praised their hosts for granting them unprecedented access to military facilities that they said will help build trust between the superpowers. But they said the trip had not clarified how the withdrawal from Eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> will affect the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s fighting capability. `` We do n't know what combat power is left in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> after the restructuring,'' said Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasich </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ohio </LOCATION>. He said some units may be equipped with artillery for the first time. `` We came here confused and we left confused,'' he said. Committee chairman Rep. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, D-Wis., said that in the process of withdrawing six divisions from its Eastern European allies by the end of 1990, the Soviets are separating some regiments and attaching them to divisions that will remain in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> Previously, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials assumed that entire divisions would be withdrawn completely, he said. But <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> added, `` We have no evidence to indication those cuts are n't going to be made.'' <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has no obligation to outline the details of the unilateral withdrawal that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> announced at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in December. But he urged the Soviets to make their actions as clear as possible. `` The building of trust is what really counts,'' he added. The visit was one of a series of high-level contacts in an era of better U.S.-Soviet relations. The congressmen said they hoped that members of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION>'s new committee on defense and state security would visit in January or February. During their visit the congressmen also saw the Soviet space shuttle assembly facility and its high-energy laser. Two of them visited a chemical weapons decommissioning plant in <LOCATION> Chebayevsk </LOCATION>. They visited <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> ground forces in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, as well as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military headquarters in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. Rep. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>, R-Ky., said he was impressed with the size and advanced technology of the chemical plant `` I was less impressed with their candor and contingencies in case of an accident,'' he said. He urged that the two countries reach an agreement that would permit experts from the two sides to work together to dismantle chemical weapons.

 Federal investigators say mechanical failure did n't cause the <ORGANIZATION> Cessna </ORGANIZATION> 177 crash that killed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Larkin </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> and his pilot.

<HEAD>Inflation Continues to Brake from Steep First-Half Acceleration</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Consumer prices rose just 0.2 percent in July, continuing their slowdown from the steep acceleration experienced earlier in the year, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. While retail prices were up 5.9 percent for the year's first half, the moderation actually began in June, when prices also rose 0.2 percent. Private analysts and the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> said the two-month softening was a sign that the economy has moved beyond the worst inflationary period. `` It's pretty clear that inflation's peaked out,'' said <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Chimerine </PERSON>, senior economic adviser at the <ORGANIZATION> WEFA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> in <PERSON> Bala </PERSON> <PERSON> Cynwyd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION> `` We believe inflation is on a downward trend,'' said <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, with a vacationing <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. `` Economic indicators seem to be moving in the right direction and the economy is growing steadily.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the June and July figures both resulted from drops in energy and clothing prices, combined with only small gains in food costs. Rising energy and food prices had paced consumer cost increases from January through May. Analysts and the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration also took the summer's price moderation as fresh evidence that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> is succeeding in its attempts to guide the once-soaring economy to a `` soft-landing'' _ moderate growth with restrained inflation. `` The overall trend has been that the economy is, in fact, achieving the soft landing everyone was hoping for.'' said <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaber </PERSON>, an economist with the <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> forecasting firm. `` In other words, growth is continuing but inflation is under control.'' Easing inflation has been the goal of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> for more than a year as it raised interest rates with the hope of cooling the economy but not sending it into a recession. Whether the new moderation will now prompt the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> to resume nudging interest rates downward, as it began to do in June, was a matter of dispute. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the report `` should take the pressure off interest rates.'' But <PERSON> Chimerine </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunkelberg </PERSON>, dean of the <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, said they do not expect any major moves by the central bank in the immediate future. `` At this point, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> is going to sit tight and say there's no scare on the inflation side. ... The economy is showing signs of slowing, but there's really no need to make a dramatic move either,'' <PERSON> Dunkelberg </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Chimerine </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shaber </PERSON> expect little further immediate improvement in the inflation rate. Each expects inflation in the coming months to be in the range of 4.5 percent to 5 percent, compared with the 4.4 percent rate for 1987 and 1988. Last month, energy prices fell 0.7 percent. Gasoline prices, which had shot up 21.2 percent in the first five months of 1989, fell 2.2 percent, thier steepest fall since October 1986. Other, less significant, energy prices rose. Fuel oil was up 1.5 percent, reversing June's 1.2 percent decline, while electricity and natural gas costs rose 0.7 percent and 0.4 percent respectively. Clothing costs were off 0.8 percent, due in large part to unusually high end-of-season price cuts for women's clothing, the department said. At the same time, food and beverage prices edged up just 0.3 percent after rising a hefty 9.3 percent in the first five months of 1989 as the effects of last year's drought lingered. Prices for cereal products, beverages and sweets all rose substantially, but were offset by a 0.7 percent decline in the costs of meats, poultry, fish and eggs. Excluding the volatile food and energy areas, consumer prices rose a moderate 0.4 percent. Tobacco costs rose 2 percent while new-car prices fell 0.4 percent. All the prices changes are seasonally adjusted, a process designed to remove from the calculations influences that are periodic and predictable. The various July changes, unadjusted, left the overall Consumer Price Index at 124.4 percent of its 1982-84 base. That means a hypothetical selection of goods costing $ 100 in the base period would have cost $ 124.40 in July, 30 cents more than in June. In a separate report, the department said Americans' average weekly earnings, after adjusting for inflation, rose 1.5 percent in July after a 0.1 percent increase in June. The July rise stemmed from a 0.8 percent increase in average hourly earnings and a 0.9 percent increase in average weekly hours, which were partially offset by a 0.2 percent increase in prices as measured by an index for urban wage earners. Average weekly earnings in July, before adjusting for inflation, were $ 338.01, up 4.2 percent from a year earlier. Taking the 5.1 percent inflation rate for urban workers into account over the last 12 months, real weekly earnings were down 0.9 percent.

<TEXT>
 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> will urge the young to spread Roman Catholicism when he addresses an unusual rally Saturday in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> that promises to resemble a huge Scout jamboree. The church has brought in 160 bishops, including Cardinal <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, and expects at least 300,000 youngsters at the international rally, the highlight of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s three-day visit to <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. Young people from 55 countries are traveling to <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> de Compostela for the church-sponsored fourth World Youth Day, including groups from communist <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> and the Soviet republic of <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>. Most are housed in tents, turning the city of 85,000 and its environs into a giant campground. A flotilla of about 600 motorboats and fishing vessels sailed into nearby <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coruna </LOCATION> on Friday, recalling pilgrims who traveled by sea to <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> de Compostela in northwestern <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. The purpose of all the activity is to capture the imagination of young people and convince them to be standard-bearers in the church's crusade for a more Christian, less secular world, <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> officials said. `` What this represents is a growing attention to youth and working with youth as a pastoral priority of the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>,'' said Monsignor <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Coughlan </PERSON>, undersecretary of the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Pontifical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> for the Laity, which organized the event. The pope's itinerary also includes visits Sunday evening and Monday to the northern cities of <LOCATION> Oviedo </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Covadonga </PERSON>, which he did not reach in his previous trips to <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> in 1982 and 1984. During those stops, the 69-year-old pontiff will say Masses dedicated to the subjects of labor and devotion to <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>. While his message at <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> is for world youth, the <LOCATION> Oviedo </LOCATION> and Covadonga trips are aimed specifically to Catholics in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, whose adherence has declined in the 11 years since church and state were officially separated in the overwhelmingly Catholic country. In addition to the rally Saturday night on a mountain just outside <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>, Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> will celebrate Youth Day with a Sunday Mass. <PERSON> Coughlan </PERSON> said the <PERSON> pope </PERSON>'s attention to youth was both personal and strategic. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> has had a long-standing interest in young people through his work as a university professor, bishop and cardinal. In addition, <PERSON> Coughlan </PERSON> said, the pontiff realizes the young are increasingly becoming the world's majority, especially in underdeveloped countries. `` The future of the church in places like <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> is caught up with youth,'' he said in an interview. Santiago de Compostela was chosen for the rally to emphasize the historical roots of Catholicism as the church approaches its third milennium, <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> officials say. The city became one of the three main pilgrimage sites of Christianity, along with <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, after the bones of the apostle St. <PERSON> James </PERSON> were said to have been discovered there in the 9th century. Many youngsters participating in the rally walked part of the traditional 500-mile Way of <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> that stretches from the Pyrenees to <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>. In a message for World Youth Day published in advance, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>'s history reminds Catholics that they must spread their faith. `` The world of today is a great land of mission, even in the countries with an ancient Christian tradition,'' he said. `` Everywhere today, neopaganism and the process of secularization constitute a great challenge to the evangelical message.'' Among `` secular'' practices the church opposes are abortion, artificial birth control and divorce. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> celebrated the first World Youth Day in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> in 1986, and the second in <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> plans to hold the event outside <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> every other year. This year's special day followed a week of church-sponsored cultural and religious conferences in <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> de <ORGANIZATION> Compostela </ORGANIZATION> that brought <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> youth leaders together.

 A hijacked helicopter swooped into the yard of a medium-security state prison this morning and spirited two inmates to freedom, officials said. Two women and a pilot were on board the copter when it set down at the <ORGANIZATION> Arkansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Facility </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Crowley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> at about 9:15 a.m., authorities said. The helicopter _ and the bound and gagged pilot _ were found later on the ground 35 miles north. The women and the escapees had apparently transferred to a rented van. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Kautzky </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION>, said pilot <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Graves </PERSON> told authorities the two women rented the helicopter under the pretext of taking some photos of some property east of <LOCATION> Ordway </LOCATION>. One of the women then pulled pulled a gun on Graves when they got near the prison and forced him to land. The inmates were identified as <PERSON> Freddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzales </PERSON>, 21, who was serving a four-year sentence for robbery, and <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, 21, who was sentenced for sexual assault, theft and criminal impersonation. The prison is about 50 miles east of <LOCATION> Pueblo </LOCATION> in the plains of southeastern <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>. Roadblocks were set up on two highways in the area. <PERSON> Liz </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonough </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION>, said guards were unable to fire at the helicopter as it came into the prison yard `` because the line of sight to the helicopter was very awkward. There was not a clean line of sight.'' The guards also feared for the safety of the pilot, she said. <PERSON> Kautzky </PERSON> said <PERSON> Graves </PERSON> was found tied up and gagged, but apparently unhurt, in an old farmhouse near where the helicopter was found. <PERSON> Kautzky </PERSON> had no further details on what he was able to tell authorities about the incident. The helicopter was a jet-powered Bell 206A helicopter carrying the letters N1442W, registered to <ORGANIZATION> Connelly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exploration </ORGANIZATION>, an oil-exploration company in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> reported. The two women had contracted with a private pilot service, <ORGANIZATION> Helicopter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>, which is related to Connelly Exploration and shares equipment with it. Graves is an employee of Helicopter Airways. Taking part in the hunt for the escapees were personnel from the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION>, the state patrol and the <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>. The Guard assigned helicopters to aid in the search. Authorities said <PERSON> Gonzales </PERSON> weighs 127 pounds and has black hair and brown eyes. He was eligible for parole in September 1991. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, weighing 170 pounds and with brown hair and green eyes, was eligible for parole in October 1996. The incident was the latest in a rash of helicopter prison escapes and escape attempts in recent years. The most recent in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was April, when a helicopter crashed after its tail rotor caught on a fence at the federal <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>. Both the pilot the would-be escapee survived the crash. In July 1988, a woman hijacked a helicopter and forced the pilot to land in the prison yard of the Penitentary of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>. Three convicts escaped but were eventually captured. In November 1986, an inmate who had escaped a minimum-security federal prison in <LOCATION> Pleasanton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, hijacked a helicopter and returned to the prison to free a woman inmate who worked with him in the prison business office. The couple were recaptured 10 days later as they were buying wedding rings.

<HEAD>Boston Mayor Wants City Funds Out of Companies that Discriminate

<TEXT>
 Mayor <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> said Friday he is working to get city pension money and trust funds away from companies that do business in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and fail to reduce job discrimination against Catholics. `` We have to make sure the British government understands the importance of fair employment practices and opening their economy to all,'' said <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON>, who said he witnessed widespread job discrimination against <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> <PERSON> Catholics </PERSON> when he visited <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> last year. The unemployment rate is twice as high for Catholics as it is for Protestants in British-ruled <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. Catholics are a minority there but a majority in the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> filed a home rule petition Thursday calling for the divestiture and signed an executive order requiring city contractors owned by companies doing business in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> to subscribe to the MacBride Principles. The principles, named after the late Irish diplomat <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> MacBride </PERSON>, winner of the 1974 Nobel Peace Prize, are aimed at reducing job discrimination against Catholics. The guidelines provide for equal access to jobs and promotion, the banning of religious emblems from the workplace, public advertising of jobs and for companies to monitor their affirmative action efforts. <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Costello </PERSON>, <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON>'s adviser on Irish affairs, said the principles were modeled after the Sullivan Principles, which address investment in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The home rule petition must be approved by the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and the Legislature. The executive order, which affects contracts worth several million dollars, does not need <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> approval. <PERSON> Costello </PERSON> said he expected the plan would win legislative approval since <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, in 1984, became the first state in the nation to pass a law embracing the McBride Principles. Ten other states and a half-dozen cities have taken similar action. Costello said previous legislation has been largely symbolic and that <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON>'s proposals are enforceable. He said <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> would campaign for other mayors to take similar steps. <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> was considering such a proposal. The contractor order would not affect hiring practices of contractors locally but would take their contracts away if their owners do n't follow the employment standards in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. Costello said the MacBride standards for <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> are no more severe than the affirmative action requirements on minority hiring in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` This is not an effort against American companies at all,'' <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> said. `` Certainly we do not want to hurt job opportunities or the economy of <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>.'' But <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, deputy consul general for <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, said that is exactly what would happen. Pressure to abide by the principles has had `` a discouraging effect on new American companies trying to establish themselves in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` If you follow the MacBride Principles, you have to sack Protestants and hire Catholics,'' said <PERSON> White </PERSON>, which would only add to the tense environment in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> White </PERSON> said <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> should give a law passed earlier this year by British <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> a chance to work. The law outlaws job discrimination in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, but does not require affirmative action. <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> has about $ 11 million in pension funds invested in seven of the 24 American companies doing business in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and $ 2 million in trust funds invested in nine of the companies. More than half of the $ 11 million in pension money and nearly one-fourth of the trust funds are invested in <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Woman Arrested On Charges of Using Drugs During Pregnancy</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A woman whose newborn tested positive for cocaine was being held on $ 20,000 bond Friday on charges she used drugs during pregnancy. <PERSON> Marcelle </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON>, 25, was arrested Friday on felony charges of criminal neglect. A warrant charges her with being `` a cocaine user, causing her infant baby's health and life to be in danger.'' She is the fourth woman in <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION> in less than a week to be arrested on such charges. The infant was born last weekend at <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Memorial </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> and remains in the hospital, said police Detective D.L. <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>. Police will take the baby into protective custody next week, Ms. <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> said. She said the infant could be placed in foster care by the state. Of the babies born to the other three women arrested, one is in the hospital and two are in foster care, officials said. A meeting is planned next week among police, state officials, the solicitor's office and the hospital to work out a formal system for handling these drug cases, Ms. <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> said. `` This is just the beginning,'' she said. `` You're going to see a whole lot more of these in the future.'' The hospital has supported the police, but some hospital employees questioned the prosecution of mothers who come to the hospital to deliver their children. A woman who gives birth to a drug-addicted baby should be treated as a medical rather than criminal matter, said <PERSON> Rosemary </PERSON> <PERSON> Boling </PERSON>, head nurse at Memorial's nursery. `` If the mother knew she would be criminally prosecuted, she might avoid prenatal care. That would put an already at-risk -LRB- baby -RRB- at even more risk,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Catalana </PERSON>, an instructor in Memorial's pediatric residency program. But county Assistant Solicitor <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Christophillis </PERSON> said the arrests protest the babies and offer a chance to get the women into treatment programs. `` It's not like I'm out here saying all these mothers should go to jail,'' Ms. <PERSON> Christophillis </PERSON> said. `` My goal is to rehabilitate them if they want to, to provide an opportunity for them and then take a look and see if they want to do it.''

<HEAD>Special Prosecutor Cites Flaws in Ethics Act</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Ethics in Government Act is `` riddled with exceptions and loopholes'' that let former executive branch officials lobby with few restrictions, the prosecutor who won a perjury conviction against <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> said Friday. Prosecuting <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> on charges of lying about his lobbying of former government colleagues `` was a useful contribution to the public interest,'' independent counsel <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> said in a final report on the case. But <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> noted his inability to seek charges against the former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> deputy chief of staff accusing him of violating lobbying restrictions in the ethics law. <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> said the lobbying provisions in effect at the time of the <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> case were `` riddled with exceptions and loopholes which made it extremely difficult to enforce except for the most flagrant violations.'' The prosecutor said there was an absence of sufficient readily available, credible evidence and there were legal questions about the scope of the ethics law. <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON>'s lawyers said in their own report that <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON>'s conclusions `` ring hollow. They said the investigation and prosecution of <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> `` raise concerns about the potential for abuse'' of the ethics law under which <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> was appointed to launch his criminal probe. For purposes of the post-employment lobbying restrictions of the ethics law, the White House at the time of the <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> case was divided into nine separate agencies, a situation known as compartmentalization. The law prohibits former employees from lobbying the agency or department where they worked. But because of compartmentalization, <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> had `` a blanket exemption for contacts with most of the key White House officials he had worked with regularly,'' said <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON>. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has since decided to treat the various White House components as one agency for purposes of the ethics law. Legislation to ban compartmentalization is pending. Nonetheless, `` even where a former official employs his own former staff aides for his lobbying business and uses them to carry personal messages to his former agency,'' such activity is permitted, said <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON>. <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON>'s lawyers said <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON>'s comments contradict his earlier statements in court that <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> had committed perjury in order to conceal his violations of the ethics law. `` We now know that Mr. <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> knew that that was not true at the very time that he was telling the court that it was,'' said <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON>'s lawyers In response, the prosecutor issued a six-page statement saying that `` <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> distorts Independent Counsel's explanation for not prosecuting him'' for violations of the ethics law. <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> said he never concluded that <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> did n't violate the ethics law. <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> was convicted of lying when he denied to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that he had facilitated a meeting between the Korean trade representative and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. He also was convicted for lying to a grand jury by denying that he made government contacts on behalf of <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> and denying he contacted government officials for the Commonwealth of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON>'s conclusions and <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON>'s response were released by a special panel of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s onetime deputy chief of staff was fined $ 100,000 and ordered to perform 1,500 hours of community service for his three felony convictions in 1987 of lying under oath to a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee and grand jury that questioned him about his lobbying of former <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration colleagues. Citing a $ 1 million legal bill, <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> is seeking to reduce to $ 25,000 the $ 100,000 fine. <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> has begun counseling alcoholics at a downtown shelter for the homeless.

 A truck hauling 40,000 rounds of military aircraft ammunition caught fire on an interstate highway early today, killing a woman and seriously injuring her companion, authorities said. Hours after the fire broke out, the northbound lanes of the interstate were still closed as shells continued to explode. But the accident happened in a remote area and no one had to be evacuated, officials said. `` It was like fireworks,'' Rock Springs Fire Chief <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>. He said ammunition and shell casings were scattered 100 yards around the truck and explosions kept everyone at a distance for hours. Sgt. <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION>, said the couple aboard the truck were believed to be husband and wife. `` Somehow, the gentleman was either thrown free or got out,'' he said. The woman was found dead. The man was in serious but stable condition in <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> at midday, hospital spokesperson <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Boulay </PERSON> said. The couple's names were not immediately released. The truck-trailer rig, under contract to the military, was on Interstate 17 en route to the <ORGANIZATION> Navajo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Depot </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Flagstaff </LOCATION> when a fire apparenty engulfed it about 1 a.m., <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> said. It was hauling 20 millimeter aircraft cannon ammunition. Smoke was still coming from the truck and ammunition was still exploding sporadically five hours later, said <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON>. The accident occurred in a rural, sparsely populated area about 30 miles north of <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> said there were no evacuations. I-17 was completely closed for three hours, but the southbound lanes were later reopened and were accommodating traffic in both directions. They are separated from the northbound lanes by several hundred feet. `` No one is going near this vehicle,'' said <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON>. `` There are still occasionally explosions, as rounds go off. We do not really know how far ammunition has been thrown from the vehicle, but it has been thrown.'' Two teams of ordnance experts from <ORGANIZATION> Luke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, near <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huchuca </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vista </LOCATION>, in southern <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, were dispatched to the scene. Lt. Col. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooke </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Kelly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> confirmed the truck carried 40,000 rounds of Class D ammunition, weighing 37,000 pounds. <PERSON> Cooke </PERSON> said said the ammunition had been stored in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> but came originally from a <LOCATION> Kelly-run </LOCATION> storage facility located at <ORGANIZATION> Lackland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, also in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> said authorities either got erroneous information from the military or misunderstood it when they initially reported the truck carried 800,000 rounds of ammunition.

 An F-4 Phantom jet smashed into a concrete barrier at 480 mph in a test to learn how to protect a nuclear reactor from a plane crash. The surplus plane, strapped to rails and propelled by rockets, slammed into a million-pound barrier at <ORGANIZATION> Sandia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> on April 18, 1988. Details of the test were reported Thursday during the 10th International Conference on Structural Mechanics in Reactor Technology at <LOCATION> Anaheim </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> `` The crash data are going to give us an unprecedented ability to predict the impact force when an aircraft crashes into a building,'' said <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Riesemann </PERSON>, supervisor of <ORGANIZATION> Sandia </ORGANIZATION>'s containment technology division. `` We'd previously done some fairly accurate computer analysis, but the computer models were untried on the real thing. Not anymore.'' Researchers need to estimate the structural response of a building in such an accident. To do that they must know how the impact force changes throughout the brief time the crash is in progress, <ORGANIZATION> Sandia </ORGANIZATION> officials said. The F-4 jet weighed 42,000 pounds at impact, which included more than 1,200 gallons of water to simulate the weight of fuel and provide proper mass distribution, <ORGANIZATION> Sandia </ORGANIZATION> officials said. Sixteen high-speed framing cameras recorded the crash, shooting from 500 to 2,000 frames per second. The concrete block, supported by air bags that enabled it to be moved with just 2,000 pounds of force, suffered minor damage, with the engines penetrating no more than 2.4 inches. The target was able to move, acting much like a bathroom scale, with the force of impact determined by measuring how much the block moved. The test was funded by the <ORGANIZATION> Muto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Structural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mechanics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>US Cutting Military Training, Presence To Protest Abuses</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is reducing its military training and presence in <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION> to protest `` gruesome'' human rights abuses by security forces in the strategically placed east African nation, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said Friday. The decision comes as the administration seeks to renegotiate an agreement for use of the <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Berbera </LOCATION> by <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> vessels moving to and from the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>. The pact expires next year. Although <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military assistance to <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION> in the past two years has dwindled sharply, the decision to cut it further indicates <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> frustration with the government's inability to reign in the security forces and control a growing mutiny throughout the country, the officials said. `` As a token of our frustration with the security forces, we decided to reduce our military activities,'' said one official. `` The government of <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION> knows it's no longer business as usual.'' Officials are still examining what programs to cut, `` but we'll be looking at training areas,'' and that will mean pulling out some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military advisers, the official said <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION>, which had shifted its alliance from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> in 1977, flirted with <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> last year and received some military supplies. But with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision to suspend weapons deliveries, <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION> has been buying arms on the open market to use against some rebels. `` There's general, communal strife throughout <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION>,'' said one official. `` Gvernment control outside <LOCATION> Mogadishu </LOCATION> is slipping,'' he added, speaking only on condition of anonymity. In the northern part of the impoverished country of 6 million, the <ORGANIZATION> Somali </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> has gained ground against government troops, while in the south, <LOCATION> Ogadeni </LOCATION> tribesmen are conducting a hit-and-run guerrilla campaign. Reliable information is hard to come by because journalists have been prevented from visiting the country and dissidents are afraid to speak out. But the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says there are credible reports that last month, security forces summarily executed dozens of Somalis on the beach near <LOCATION> Mogadishu </LOCATION> following clashes between Moslems and government troops that left 400 people dead. `` The events are tragic, gruesome,'' said the official. `` I hope the government can find their way out of it, but they seem to have lost their way.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had been encouraged earlier this year when President <PERSON> Siad </PERSON> <PERSON> Barre </PERSON>, under strong congressional pressure from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, freed 200 to 300 political prisoners. <PERSON> Barre </PERSON>, an autocratic ruler who has run the one-party state since 1969, also agreed to speak to some opposition figures. To encourage further progress, the administration asked <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for $ 21 million to help <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION> pay its arrears to the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>, said the official. But with the rioting in mid-July and the mass executions, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> turned down the request, he said. `` We decided not to fight it. We ca n't make a credible argument to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. We ca n't show anything positive,'' he said. The administration has sought to stave off congressional criticism of <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION>'s human rights violations in recent years through backstage pressure on <PERSON> Barre </PERSON> to improve his record. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last year froze nearly $ 40 million in food and development aid for <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION>, and the administration decided to suspend all lethal weapons supplies after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> rifles and ammunition were used against rebels and civilians in the north. Most of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid since then has been of non-lethal military equipment, as well as training of Somali personnel. The <ORGANIZATION> Somali </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, which is the largest anti-government force, has been fighting <PERSON> Barre </PERSON>'s forces for seven years. At least one senior government commander reportedly deserted in recent weeks. But most of the country's six major tribes appear to be warring against the government or each other, said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official. `` Events are running beyond anyone's control. It strains one's credulity to think someone is masterminding it But responsibility for controling the situation lies with the government forces,'' he said.

<HEAD>Party Leaders Spurn Appeals to Reassess Soviet-Led Invasion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leadership Friday refused to reassess the 1968 <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact invasion that abruptly halted the nation's move toward a freer society. The 21st anniversary of the Soviet-led invasion is Monday. The occasion has brought many appeals, including from <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact neighbors, to rewrite the emotional chapter in Czechoslovak history. The party leadership, however, refused to alter the official view that the invasion was a good thing. `` There are various attempts at home and abroad at would-be reassessment of the events of the time,'' said a <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presidium </ORGANIZATION> statement carried by the official <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> news agency. `` The period of social crisis in 1968-69 and events connected with this period have been thoroughly assessed and evaluated, using all accessible documents by the 14th Congress of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in 1971,'' the statement said. That congress condemned the `` <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> Spring'' reforms and gave formal approval to the armed intervention. The anniversary of the invasion has highlighted the divisions in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc, where some nations are experimenting with more open economies and cultures and others are adhering to strict socialism. The lower house of the <ORGANIZATION> Polish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday adopted a resolution asserting that the invasion `` violated every nation's ... natural desire for democracy, freedom and respect of human rights.'' The upper house criticized the invasion last week. Hungarian Communists issued a statement Tuesday saying they disagreed with the invasion and urged the <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> leadership to reassess the events. But the invasion has been defended by <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, which has rejected the sort of democratic reforms undertaken by <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> are among the most hard-line Soviet bloc countries. The intervention `` proved to be the only effective way out,'' <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> German </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily, said Friday. <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> said the Presidium agreed that the Hungarian statement `` objectively helps forces which act against socialism in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>.'' The Czechoslovak government again served notice Thursday that it would crack down on all public demonstrations attempting to commemorate the anniversary. Czechoslovak human rights groups and prominent activists have asked there be no street protests, citing fears of a harsh response by the authorities. The 1968 invasion crushed the short-lived liberalization period spearheaded by then-Communist Party leader <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>. Except for <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, the invasion included all of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact allies: the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>

 Three paintings valued at $ 2.3 million, including two works by the Spanish master <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Velazquez </PERSON>, are missing from their places in the Royal Palace, an official said Friday. The paintings were reported missing from a restricted area in the national museum by members of a restoration crew, said the palace official, who asked not to be identified.

The two <PERSON> Velazquez </PERSON> paintings are valued at $ 820,000 each, the official said. One painting portrays a cleric holding up a piece of paper bearing the artist's signature. The second depicts a woman's head The third painting, by <PERSON> Carreno </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Miranda </PERSON> and valued at $ 615,000, portrays the bust a woman from the era of Charles II.

 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on Friday again criticized <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s allies in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> for shelling Christian enclaves in the war-torn country and urged them to observe a cease-fire on all fronts. Spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said recent reports indicated Syrian troops were not actively engaged in the fighting. But he stressed the reports dealt with a 12-hour period and it was too early to say whether <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> had heeded a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> call to lay down its arms. `` The most urgent thing, the most important thing, is for people to accept a cease-fire,'' <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said. Deferring again to the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> to try to stop the fighting, <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said, `` We would welcome a resumption of their efforts.'' He said that Amal and Druze militias were continuing their drive against <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> enclaves and that the Christians were retaliating. `` We feel there is no justification for continued military action in the face of urgent appeals and we urge all sides to implement and immediately observe a cease-fire on all fronts,'' <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said. On Monday, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> sharply condemned <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and its allies for the eruption of large-scale ground fighting in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and said the turmoil in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> country made <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> efforts to gain the release of American hostages more difficult. `` Syria-supported forces have joined the latest round of fighting in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said Friday. `` This represents an irresponsible escalation of the violence. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and its allies should refrain from any further escalation and accept immediately international and <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> calls for a cease-fire and a lifting of the blockade'' of Christian ports. At the same time, <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> urged the Christians to observe a cease-fire and to join in the `` political reconstruction'' of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. This means, in effect, agreeing to new power-sharing arrangements with <PERSON> Muslims </PERSON> that would reduce Maronite influence in the country.

 Police whipped and opened fire Friday on hundreds of black workers protesting a lockout at their workplace, and the company director said at least 17 employees were injured. Also Friday, police arrested a leader of the anti-apartheid movement's national defiance campaign and banned a weekend rally that was planned as part of the 3-week-old campaign. A court sentenced <PERSON> Trevor </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, son of Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, to 18 months in prison for making a false bomb threat at <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>'s international airport The clash outside a pie company began after about 400 workers gathered at its gate to protest being locked out. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Silber </PERSON>, managing director of Mama's Pies, said the lockout was imposed because of a 4-week-old wage dispute. The Food and <ORGANIZATION> Allied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> said police used whips and live ammunition to disperse the workers and made several arrests. Capt. <PERSON> Reg </PERSON> <PERSON> Crewe </PERSON>, a spokesman at police headquarters in <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>, said police acted only after workers began pulling on the locked gates and ingored an order to disperse. He said officers initially used whips but fired shotguns when some fleeing workers threw stones. He said four people were slightly injured by shotgun fire. He said no one was arrested. It was the second violent labor clash in two days. On Thursday, police said at least 10 people were injured outside the British-owned Eveready plant in <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Elizabeth </LOCATION> in clashes between striking workers and people recruited to fill their jobs. <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Valli </PERSON> <PERSON> Moosa </PERSON>, an official of the banned <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> and an organizer of a 3-week-old defiance campaign, was arrested at his <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> office. A police officer said he was held under emergency regulations allowing detention of anyone deemed a threat to public safety. <PERSON> Valli </PERSON> <PERSON> Moosa </PERSON> has been one of the highest-ranking activists not under any restrictions. He was one of three activists who escaped detention last year and took sanctuary at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Consulate in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. One of the other escapees, <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> <PERSON> Morobe </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Valli </PERSON> <PERSON> Moosa </PERSON>'s arrest violated the government's promise that the three could leave the consulate without fear of being detained again or placed under restrictions The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, a nationwide coalition, and 16 other anti-apartheid groups last year were ordered to halt all activities. They intended to defy the order and declared themselves legal at a rally Sunday, the group's sixth anniversary. Police officials banned the rally but did not say if all defiance rallies planned Sunday would be banned. The rallies were organized as part of a nationwide defiance campaign that began Aug. 3, when blacks sought treatment at segregated white hospitals. Since then, dozens of activists have defied restrictions imposed on them. Archbishop <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> described the ban as `` inflammatory'' and called for an alternative `` service of witness'' at his church in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>. The younger <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> was convicted of violating the Aviation Act by falsely telling police there was a bomb in his luggage. He pleaded innocent and said he would appeal. He also was convicted on five other charges stemming from two other incidents. In addition to the 18-month sentence, <PERSON> Tuto </PERSON> was fined $ 440. Shortly after the Dec. 31 bomb incident at <LOCATION> Jan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Smuts </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> convened a news conference and told reporters he deliberately courted arrest as part of a publicity stunt on behalf of his advertising agency. The other charges include three counts of slandering police and traffic officers, one count of interfering with police last year when they tried to arrest a friend of his on suspicion of drunken driving, and one count of maliciously damaging a police officer's hat

 Two men armed with assault rifles shot an armored car guard to death and wounded another in a botched holdup at a shopping center Friday, authorities said. The guards had just finished making a delivery to the <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in an exclusive section of the borough of <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION> when they were confronted at 11:20 a.m., said Detective <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> McConville </PERSON>. The guards exchanged gunfire with the two men, and at least a dozen shots were fired, <PERSON> McConville </PERSON> said. One guard was shot in the head and the other was hit in the chest, arm and groin, <PERSON> McConville </PERSON> said. The 26-year-old guard who was shot in the head was pronounced dead at 12:15 p.m. at <ORGANIZATION> Booth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, police said. The other guard was in critical condition at the hospital. The gunmen fled in a car. No money was taken. The guards' names were not released pending notification of their families. A third security guard who was inside the armored van when the shooting broke out was not wounded. The bullet-marked car was recovered a short time later in a wooded area near a city highway. Investigators found three guns near the vehicle, but believed the gunmen were still aarmed. Police helicopters and bloodhounds searched a park and an apartment complex near the highway.

 Solidarity editor <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> declared Friday that he is ready to accept President <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>'s offer to nominate him as prime minister and break the Communist grip on power in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>, a veteran opposition activist who spent a year in jail during <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>'s martial law crackdown of 1981, confirmed he is the president's choice to lead the next government. `` Our Premier!'' the opposition newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Gazeta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wyborcza </ORGANIZATION> proclaimed triumphantly, if somewhat prematurely, in a headline above <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>'s smiling picture Friday. The formal announcement was planned for Saturday, the state official said. But already the offical <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> news agency was treating <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>, editor of the Solidarity union weekly <ORGANIZATION> Tygodnik </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Solidarnosc </ORGANIZATION>, as a major public figure. It reported throughout the day his meetings with dignitaries. The appointment of a Solidarity-led government, the first non-Communist government in the Soviet bloc since Soviet dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> consolidated control of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in the late 1940s, would be an event of historic significance. Local Communist Party chapters expressed dismay Friday, <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> reported. `` We are firmly against forming a government as proposed by the opposition,'' said a statement issued by the Wroclaw party. `` We appeal to the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> for a defense of socialist values,'' said the <LOCATION> Walbrzych </LOCATION> chapter, according to <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> met Friday with party chief <PERSON> Mieczyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON>, who has called a meeting of his <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> for Saturday to discuss the government changes. <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> also met with <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> primate Cardinal <PERSON> Jozef </PERSON> <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON>. After meeting with <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> confirmed he expected to be offered the post and would accept despite the `` huge problems'' he sees ahead. `` It wo n't be easy,'' he said, referring to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s crippled economy, $ 39 billion foreign debt, food shortages and widespread public discontent. `` I think the most difficult task will be to make people think that it can be better _ even though it can not be better immediately _ and make them believe that their work is not wasted,'' he said at the National Assembly building. Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, who deftly assembled the coalition of lawmakers that has apparently engineered a transfer of the government away from the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, proposed <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> to <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> at a meeting Thursday. <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> was one of three candidates offered by <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and his coalition partners, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peasant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> parties, and according to Solidarity sources he was <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s first choice. In addition to being the first non-Communist premier, <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> would be the first practicing Catholic to head the government in this highly religious country since the war. `` I am afraid of many things,'' <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> said. `` But if I were only afraid, I would be a total pessimist. Somebody has to try it. I am a believer and I believe providence cares for us.'' He said the talk with <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> was `` very fundamental, concerning all important topics.'' Mindful of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s strategic concerns, Solidarity has said it will grant the Communists the ministries of defense and interior, which oversee the army and police. The Soviet government daily <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> on Friday said it is clear <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> is headed for its first `` non-Communist'' government in decades. Perhaps to reassure Soviets there would be some continuity, <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> also ran excerpts from an interview <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> gave to West German TV in which he said <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> would remain in the Soviet-led <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> military alliance. While <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in recent days has expressed concern over the developments, Soviet foreign ministry officials have said that formation of the government is an internal Polish affair. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at this point is not considering expanding the $ 119 million economic aid package he has announced for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, said White House Press Secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would have no comment on the selection of a new prime minister until the parliamentary process. Even with a non-Communist coalition in charge of the government, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> will continue to wield great influence. <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> oversees military and foreign policy as president, and party members are scattered throughout the government and courts. <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> must nominate the prime minister for approval by the <ORGANIZATION> Sejm </ORGANIZATION>, the lower house of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. Approval would seem assured because the Solidarity-led coalition forms a 264-member majority in the 460-member chamber. <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> would be given a period of several weeks to assemble a Cabinet and present it to the Sejm for a vote. <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> accepted the concept of a Solidarity-led government during a historic meeting with <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> on Thursday. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> also offered two alternative candidates to <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>: Solidarity parliamentary leader <PERSON> Bronislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Geremek </PERSON> and longtime activist <PERSON> Jacek </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuron </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>, 62, was the least publicly known of the three, but his ties to Solidarity date to the August 1980 strikes in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> that gave birth to the movement. A <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> journalist trained as a lawyer, he was jailed for one year after the 1981 martial-law crackdown for his opposition to the government. <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> also was at <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s side when nationwide strikes last year served as the catalyst for the government's decision to open talks with the union, legalize it and allow opposition participation in elections Those elections resulted in Solidarity's victory in virtually every race its candidates entered. Before the union's rise, <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> was active in independent Catholic circles. <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> was part of the <ORGANIZATION> ZNAK </ORGANIZATION> group that managed under church protection to serve as a focal point for thinking independent of Communist ideology in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in the 1960s and 1970s. The group was allowed a token number of seats in parliament and <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> held one from 1961 to 1971. He was the editor of a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> monthly from 1958 until 1981 when he founded <ORGANIZATION> Tygodnik </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Solidarnosc </ORGANIZATION>. It was banned under martial law but resurrected by <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> this year after Solidarity was legalized. By rejecting the office of prime minister this week, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> remains free to head the union. There is fear in the opposition that the coalition government might fail to satisfy social aspirations in the face of the country's crushing economic problems and have to resign. Union advisers argued <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> should not risk his personal reputation.

 Amish have a constitutional right to refuse to affix safety emblems to their horse-drawn buggies, a unanimous <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled Friday. The decision dismissed traffic citations issued in 1988 against 14 Amish who had refused to display orange-red slow-moving vehicle signs or an alternate black triangular emblem on their black buggies. `` It's a precedent-setting First Amendment case,'' said attorney <PERSON> Phillip </PERSON> <PERSON> Villaume </PERSON>, who represented the Amish. `` Our <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> is the highest court in the country to address this specific issue. It's just a major victory for individuals, and for the Amish specifically.'' Assistant Fillmore County Attorney <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Opat </PERSON>, who argued in support of the law, said the ruling jeopardizes highway users _ even though there have been no accidents involving Amish buggies. `` It does n't seem reasonable to have to have people killed and maimed before there is a public safety issue,'' <PERSON> Opat </PERSON> said. He was unsure whether the county would appeal. The 14 members of the Old Order Amish religion had drawn petty misdemeanor charges for their refusal to use the emblems. `` These appellants ... are unwilling to compromise their belief that the ` loud' colors required and the ` worldly symbols' the triangular shape represents to them conflicts with the admonitions found in Apostle <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s Epistles,'' wrote Associate Justice <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON>. `` To them to do so would be putting their faith in ` worldly symbols' rather than in God.'' <LOCATION> Fillmore </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, just north of the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> border in southeastern <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, has about 1,000 Amish residents, who adhere to 19th century customs and generally do not use cars or other modern conveniences. There are about 90,000 Amish in 22 states, with the largest population in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, which has about 31,000 Amish, followed by <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>'s 27,000 and <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>'s 22,000. Fillmore County District Judge <PERSON> Clement </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> refused in December to dismiss the charges, but also asked that a higher state court review the matter. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> held that the trial court improperly determined that to be `` sincere'' a belief must be shared by a religious community as a whole. `` The fact that at least one of the appellants has already actually suffered jail incarceration, and that the others have persistently expressed a willingness to do so rather than comply with the statute, must assuredly buttress that implicit finding that the appellants individually possessed a personal sincerity of belief,'' <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON> said. Two Amish men were jailed on contempt of court charges filed after they refused to perform community work or pay a fine for their failure to use warning emblems, <PERSON> Opat </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said the state has a legitimate interest in protecting the public on its highways. But it said even the black-triangle option was burdensome to Amish beliefs. During the daytime, the alternate emblem does not provide any more warning of the presence of a slow-moving vehicle than does the black square horse-drawn buggy itself, the court said. At night and in bad weather, the Amish have said they do not object to outlining the boxes of their buggies with silver reflective tape or to displaying red, lit lanterns to supplement the tapes, the court said. `` Obviously, the Amish are very concerned about the men, women and children riding in those buggies,'' <PERSON> Villaume </PERSON> said. `` They're cautious, and are n't likely to compromise their safety When you put a buggy up against a vehicle, the buggy obviously is vulnerable.'' Under the court's ruling, Amish do n't have to use any warning insignia on their slow-moving vehicles, <PERSON> Villaume </PERSON> said. However, he said he will advise them to use the tape and lanterns cited by the court.

 Police roused scores of homeless people from their cardboard boxes and piles of blankets early Friday to drive them from the streets around <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Port </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> bus station. `` Why do they want to push all the people out?'' <PERSON> Ida </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> asked as she neatly folded the sheet that served as her mattress. Then she picked up her dirty purple teddy bear, shoved her bandaged foot into a laceless sneaker and limped away as police approached at about 2 a.m. The six <ORGANIZATION> Port </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> officers who moved about 100 homeless people out were said to be opposed to the operation, but acting under orders. `` It's like throwing sand in the ocean,'' one sergeant said. The officers were followed by 10 men with brooms and garbage bins to collect the meager possessions left behind. The first vagrants to be evicted had about five minutes to pack up the blankets they had draped from scaffolding on the side of the building before the garbage detail dismantled the makeshift curtains for them. People living nearby saw the police coming and had more time to pack. An elderly woman stacked her blankets and belongings into a teetering shopping cart. `` I'm OK,'' she said over and over again. Then she said: `` They're not going to throw this in the garbage. It's against the law.'' A 16-year-old girl was taken to nearby <ORGANIZATION> Covenant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, which helps those under age 21. The area in and around the bus station has a large homeless population, ranging from the needy who have nowhere else to go to a younger, tougher crowd involved in drugs and prostitution. During Friday morning's operation 16 men agreed to go in a van to a shelter on <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>'s Island run by the <ORGANIZATION> Volunteers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. Others crammed what they could into milk crates and took off for nearby streets, saying they would be back in a day or two. No one was arrested. `` People ca n't sleep in a shelter,'' <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> said as he roused a grizzled friend sleeping nearby, put the man's arm over his shoulder and led him hobbling away. Another man refused to leave his pile of cardboard, saying he was scheduled for a foot operation the next day and was to be picked up at the bus terminal. Police appeared skeptical until he produced his hospital appointment papers from a paper bag. Inspector <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Romito </PERSON>, who directed the operation, finally persuaded him to leave in an <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> ambulance. `` I do n't think we're overstepping our bounds. I do n't think we're doing anything inhumane,'' <PERSON> Romito </PERSON> said. `` This is part of our job. What the police are supposed to do is maintain order.''

 Syrian gunners fired 120 rockets Friday at the only passenger vessel that serves the Christian enclave, wounding seven people on the pier and forcing the ship to flee for <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, police said. It left behind hundreds trying to escape the artillery war that has killed 779 people and wounded 2,109, by police count, in five months. The sea route to <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> is the only link to the outside for the 1 million Christians of the 310-square-mile enclave, which is sealed on the other three sides by Syrian soldiers, guns and tanks. At the northern end of the Christian enclave, <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> soldiers fought a four-hour battle across the <LOCATION> Madfoun </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> bridge that police described as the heaviest since the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Security passed a cease-fire resolution Tuesday. They said the <ORGANIZATION> Syrians </ORGANIZATION> fired at merchant ships sailing into the Christian port of <LOCATION> Amsheet </LOCATION>, just south of the river, Friday afternoon and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> gunners fired on Syrian positions, touching off the exchange. <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> radio stations said nine Syrian soldiers were killed and 12 wounded in the clash 28 miles north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, and gave <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> casualties as four wounded. Police said they could not confirm the report. Syrian gunners regularly bombard the Christian-held coast north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> to disrupt the flow of arms and other supplies to the Christians. Police said three people were killed and 26 wounded in sporadic artillery exchanges elsewhere. In <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>, King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, met on Friday and agreed to ask the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> for an emergency summit on the <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> crisis. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, an enemy of <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, is the Christians' main arms supplier In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said: `` We feel there is no justification for continued military action in the face of urgent appeals and we urge all sides to ... observe a cease-fire on all fronts.'' Fighting began March 8 between the 20,000 soldiers of Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s Christian army command and an alliance of 40,000 Syrian soldiers and Moslem militias. The Syrians are in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> under an <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> mandate dating from 1976, the year after <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s civil war began. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> says they are an occupation army and has declared a `` war of liberation'' to drive them out. Police said the Syrians opened up with truck-mounted multiple rocket launchers soon after midnight as the hydrofoil <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Maria </LOCATION> docked at <LOCATION> Jounieh </LOCATION>, a Christian port 12 miles north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The launchers can fire 40 rounds a minute. `` Arriving passengers had just disembarked and departing passengers were gathered on the dock to board the vessel when the rocketing started,'' a port spokesman said. `` The rockets fell around the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Maria </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` One of them crashed into the dock close to where the passengers were, wounding seven people,'' and the ship `` sped away immediately.'' <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Mansour </PERSON>, spokesman for the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Maria </LOCATION>'s agents in <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, said rockets began exploding around the ship before the crew had unloaded the baggage of 120 passengers who got off at <LOCATION> Jounieh </LOCATION>. Only eight of the 300 waiting passengers had boarded when the <PERSON> Santa </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> left. All but 150,000 of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s 1.5 million people have abandoned it for safer areas in the south and east or have left <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> altogether, according to police. They have not returned since the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> action, fearing a renewal of savage artillery battles. `` What the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>'s call for a cease-fire has achieved is nothing but a fragile lull accompanied by intermittent clashes and troop reinforcements as if all the factions are preparing themselves for a new round of war,'' the respected <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> newspaper An-Nahar said. <PERSON> Farid </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadeh </PERSON>, who owns a motel on the seaside highway south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, said: `` It seems everyone expects a new round of ferocious violence. The 40 rooms are full. No one is checking out. All my clients have apartments in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, but they've been staying here for quite a while to escape the shelling. `` Here we are relatively close to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. They hear the shell explosions, watch artillery and rocket flashes in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> during the night and drive to the city during relative lulls to check on their apartments and businesses.'' French envoy <PERSON> Alain </PERSON> <PERSON> Decaux </PERSON> held separate talks with <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> patriarch <PERSON> Nasrallah </PERSON> <PERSON> Sfeir </PERSON> and <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, but would speak with reporters.

 A bomb planted in the luggage rack of a bus exploded Friday as the vehicle was passing a market in a northern town, killing at least 15 people and wounding 30, police said. The victims of the blast at <LOCATION> Chintpurni </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Himachal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pradesh </LOCATION> state included two women and two children, police said. There were no claims of responsibility for the explosion but <ORGANIZATION> Sikh </ORGANIZATION> militants agitating for an independent nation in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> were suspected, police officials said. The bus was coming from the Sikh holy city of <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION> in neighboring <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> state and was passing <PERSON> Chintpurni </PERSON>'s main market when the explosion occurred. Most of the victims were on the bus, but at least four people on the street sustained injuries, said police officials in the town. They spoke on condition of anonymity in telephone calls from <LOCATION> Chandigarh </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>, about 70 miles north of <LOCATION> Chintpurni </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ravi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kanth </PERSON> <PERSON> Bahl </PERSON>, a doctor in a government-owned hospital in the neighboring town of <LOCATION> Una </LOCATION>, said at least 12 people died before they could be treated. `` I was told many more bodies would be coming,'' he said in a telephone conversation from his hospital, the largest in the area. <PERSON> Bahl </PERSON> said the blast appeared to have been `` extremely powerful'' because the victims' bodies were unidentifiable. A similar blast on a bus bound for <LOCATION> Nsw </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Chandigarh </LOCATION> on Aug. 9 left at least 18 people dead. Police said the explosion was caused by a time bomb planted by the militants. Sikhs form only 2 percent of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 880 million people but are in a majority in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>. Radicals from the community have been fighting for an independent nation since 1982, claiming they are discriminated by the Hindus, who make up 80 percent of the country's population At least 1,200 people have been killed in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> this year in violence blamed on the militants. In the latest violence, at least 18 people were killed on Thursday and Friday, <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> said. The toll included 12 militants shot and killed by police and the others were victims of the radicals, the news agency said.

 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> announced Friday they would hold talks in October in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> to consider restoring ties severed by their war in 1982 over the <LOCATION> Falklands </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. Both sides called the agreement to meet in <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> Oct. 17-18 a breathrough and said they were optimistic that relations would be normalized. A joint statement, issued after three days of talks in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said the <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> discussions would be held without prejudice to sovereignty over the islands claimed by both <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. The negotiators will consider diplomatic and consular relations, confidence-building measures to avoid military incidents, trade and financial relations, air and sea communications links, fisheries, contacts between the Falklands and the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> mainland and cultural, scientific and sports relations, according to the report. Sovereignty is not on the agenda. The Falklands, 325 miles off of <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s southern coast, are a British colony. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has not eased its position on sovereignty and British Ambassador Sir <PERSON> Crispen </PERSON> <PERSON> Tickell </PERSON> said the agreement to hold normalization talks was due to the initiative of <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s new president, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Saul </PERSON> <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> <PERSON> Tickell </PERSON> held the negotitaions with Argentine special representative Ambassador <PERSON> Lucio </PERSON> <PERSON> Ggarcia </PERSON> del Solar. Both men read the communique and <PERSON> Tickell </PERSON> said later: `` I would call this -LRB- agreement -RRB- a breakthrough. This development is very important for Anglo-Argentine relations and now enables us to go forward on a new basis. ... I am optimistic because we have agreed to an agenda and to hold talks without prejudice to the sovereignty position on either side.'' <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> del Solar told reporters, `` These contacts -LRB- with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> -RRB- began since President <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> openly said he wanted a solution on the basis shown in this communique today.'' <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> invaded and occupied the Falklands in April 1982 but <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> sent a task force and recaptured the islands in a 74-day war that claimed nearly 1,000 lives. The Falklands, known in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> as the <LOCATION> Malvinas </LOCATION>, has a population of about 2,000 and most of the islanders are of British descent. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has said it will not relinquish sovereignty over the islands and <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> dropped the previous government's insistence that <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s sovereignty claim would have to be the first issue considered in normalization talks. The communique said it was agreed that the <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> talks `` would take place under the terms of a formula to protect the position of each side with regard to sovereignty or territorial and maritime jurisdiction over the <LOCATION> Falkland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sandwich </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> and the surrounding maritime areas.''

<TEXT>
 About 25,000 members of the Veterans of Foreign Wars gather this weekend for their 90th annual convention and an agenda that includes resolutions against desecrating the American flag and a speech by Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. The flag `` will be the convention's most emotional issue,'' VFW spokesman <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> <PERSON> LaDue </PERSON> predicted Friday. The five-day convention, which begins Monday, is expected to be the 2 million-member organization's largest in recent memory, <LOCATION> LaDue </LOCATION> said. Defense Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>, Veterans Affairs Secretary <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> and Gen. <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, who was nominated last week to be chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>, also are scheduled to speak to the convention. The VFW also plans to honor Adm. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the retiring chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION>, four <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> aviators who shot down Libyan MiG fighter jets over the Mediterranian Sea on Jan. 4, and singer <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Newton </PERSON>. A memorial service for fallen comrades is scheduled for the eve of the convention Sunday. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is scheduled to address the gathering's opening session Monday morning. That afternoon, the veterans will begin considering about 500 resolutions covering a wide range of issues. Twenty-five resolutions are expected on the flag desecration issue alone, <LOCATION> LaDue </LOCATION> said. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on June 21 ruled that burning the flag as a political protest is protected by the First Amendment guarantee of freedom of speech. The decision prompted widespread protests on both sides of the issue, and President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposed a constitutional amendment banning desecrating the flag, which the VFW supports. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivers </PERSON>, the group's commander-in-chief and a Marine who served in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, said Friday that the nation's veterans are not ready to concede that flag burning is a free-speech issue. At a banquet Monday night, the VFW will honor <LOCATION> Newton </LOCATION> for entertaining troops around the world and <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> for his contributions `` to the cause of national security, unity and world peace.'' <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> is scheduled to speak Tuesday. The veterans' affairs secretary is expected to discuss such topics as health care for veterans. It will be <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON>'s second appearance before veterans here in three weeks. On July 31, he appeared in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s place at the Disabled American Veterans convention. On Tuesday night, the VFW will hold its annual parade in front of <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>' convention center. The four <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> aviators involved in the Libyan incident will be honored on Wednesday. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> representatives will accept the honor on behalf of the aviators, who have not been identified for security reasons, <LOCATION> LaDue </LOCATION> said. The convention ends Friday with <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON>, a Korean War veteran from <LOCATION> Greenfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, assuming the post of commander-in-chief.

 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has agreed to coordinate its military activities with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> if <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> stops criticizing the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> abduction of a Shiite Moslem cleric, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> sources said Friday. The kidnapping of Sheik <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Karim </PERSON> <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> at his south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> home by Israeli commandos July 28 caused retaliatory threats against American hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Some members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> denounced the abduction. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called for the release of all people held against their will and did not exclude <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>, who is affiliated with <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, the pro-Iranian extremist group believed to sponsor hostage-holders. The captors of Lt. Col. <PERSON> Willian </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> kidnapped while on <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> duty in <LOCATION> south </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, said they hanged him in retaliation three days after <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> was seized, but there were reports he had been killed months ago. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON>, one of the seven other American hostages, was threatened with death, then given a reprieve. An <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> source close to the government said Friday `` an understanding'' was reached between Foreign Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> and Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> soon after the <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> abduction that they would adopt a joint policy for the hostage crisis. He added, on condition of anonymity: `` There is an expressed <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> commitment, when the crisis is over, to discuss with Americans coordination of future Israeli activities that may have bearing on <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> interests and citizens.'' That, he said, was `` the price Israeli has paid for not being criticized now by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Naveh </PERSON>, an adviser to <PERSON> Arens </PERSON>, confirmed that <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> and <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> discussed future coordination in the days after the kidnapping. `` They agreed not to get into this issue during the days of the crisis, but in the future,'' <PERSON> Naveh </PERSON> said, and stressed that `` the conclusion was to discuss the issue, not necessarily reach an agreement.'' He did not describe the agreement for consultation as an exchange, but acknowledged that American criticism had abated. <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON>, an adviser to Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, said: `` In the first days after we captured <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>, there was some unhappiness in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> about it. ... Since then we have straightened out these matters through constant dialogue, and there is no problem today.'' The source close to the government said the <LOCATION> Baker-Arens </LOCATION> agreement caused concern in military and intelligence circles. `` <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> always prided itself on its autonomy in terms of strategy,'' the source said. `` There's a feeling that, in order to get off the hook for a few days, <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> has mortgaged <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s freedom of maneuver. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> congresswoman who met with <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> on Friday said she was encouraged by hopes of resolving the hostage situation, but she also said she was anxious about <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> hostage <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, the captive held longest. Rep. <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Slaughter </PERSON>, a Democrat who represents the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> state </LOCATION> <LOCATION> district </LOCATION> where <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> grew up, told reporters <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> would not give details on <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> efforts to free the captives. She said she felt `` frustration, as I am sure <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> does, that his government has n't done much.'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, was kidnapped March 16, 1985. Eight Westerners in addition to the Americans are held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>EPA Says Lime Disease Fear Prompts Misuse of Sprays</HEAD>

 The fear of catching Lyme disease from tick bites is causing people to use insect repellents in potentially harmful ways, the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>, which regulates the pesticides used in insect repellents, said misuse of repellents could result in adverse skin reactions, headaches, mood changes, and possibly even convulsions or unconsciousness. Only a `` small number'' of reports of ill effects have been received, but they have prompted `` concern that fear of Lyme disease or the use of repellents for other biting pests may result in misuse or oversuse of these products,'' the agency said. <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Georgeson </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <PERSON> S.C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> <PERSON> Wax </PERSON>, manufacturer of the insect repellent `` Off,'' said the company endorsed the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> advsisory because `` it's very important to have people continue to use these products properly.'' The company is the manufacturer of the widely used insect repellent and accounts for about 70 percent of the repellent market. She said that because of the widespread publicity surrounding Lyme disease, which is transmitted by deer ticks, sales of repellents are expected to be about 10 percent higher this year. `` Off'' accounts for about 70 percent of the repellent market, she said. Among the suggestions from the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> are: _ Apply repellents only to exposed skin and not under clothing. _ Never use repellents over cuts, wounds or irritated skin. _ Take care to keep repellents away from the eyes and mouth or the hands of small children. _ Avoid frequent reapplication or saturation of the skin. One application is good for four to six hours, depending on strength, says Ms. <PERSON> Georgeson </PERSON>. _ After returning indoors, wash repellent treated skin with soap and water, especially if repellents have been used repeatedly during the day. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said further information about the active ingredients in repellents and other information about their use can be obtained from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pesticide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunciations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>. Their 24-hour hotline number is 800-858-7378.

 The mayor and city manager of <LOCATION> Del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, asked the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> on Friday to abandon consideration of a local ranch for a series of underground explosions designed to simulate the impact of Soviet nuclear warheads on subterranean command centers. Petitions signed by nearly 12,000 <LOCATION> Del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> area residents opposed to the tests on the Buck King ranch were presented to Vice Adm. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. The Del Rio officials are concerned about the impact of the explosions on the border city's sole source of drinking water, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Felipe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, which was contaminated by an unknown substance in an underground cave-in earlier this week, forcing residents to boil or drink bottled water for two days. `` We appreciate the opportunity to meet with the <LOCATION> Del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> mayor and city manager. We better understand the concerns of the citizens,'' <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> said after the session with Mayor <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Gutierrez </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a physician, and City Manager <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Pomeranz </PERSON>. `` We're going to do everything that is possible to stop it and we so indicated to DNA,'' <PERSON> Gutierrez </PERSON> said. The Mexican government has also inquired about possible explosions, in an Aug. 4 letter that the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> answered Thursday, an official at <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. The official said the letter advises <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> that an environmental assessment of the site must still be completed before any tests would be done. Agency spokeswoman <PERSON> Cheri </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdelnour </PERSON> said the agency continues to assess the <LOCATION> Del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> site _ currently the only location nationally under consideration for the series of underground explosions _ and will not make a final decision until technical and environmental assessments are completed. The environmental assessment may take until January 1990 to finish, she said. `` Clearly, we will not be doing anything until that assessment is made _ the technical assessment as well as the environmental assessment,'' she said. The DNA, an agency of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, spent two years picking a site for the tests. The explosions would start with a 1,000-pound charge in 1990, increasing to 470 tons, an equivalent of 300 tons of <ORGANIZATION> TNT </ORGANIZATION>, in November 1992. Ms. <PERSON> Abdelnour </PERSON> said the tests would be performed with the same conventional explosives used by the mining industry, and do not involve nuclear or radioactive devices. `` They are designed to have no significant adverse impact on the environment, including the water system,'' Ms. <PERSON> Abdelnour </PERSON> said. But Sen. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>, R-Texxas, said local officials and residents have expressed great concern about the impact on the explosions on the springs, which provides water to the city of 40,000 and to nearby <ORGANIZATION> Laughlin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>. `` Given the 12,000 people who have signed a petition, and the great local concern about the tests, I think it would save the DNA's money to simply go ahead and make the decision and look for another test area,'' <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> said

 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration reacted cautiously Friday to reports that a Solidarity activist would be named <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s prime minister and to questions whether increased <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic aid might flow to such a government. `` We will continue to watch the process and will increase aid as appropriate and as we can,'' presidential press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> with the vacationing President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, said discussion of any increase in the $ 119 million aid package <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced last month was premature. He said too little is known about the structure of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s changing government. `` It's too early at this point to know how they -LRB- <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s leaders -RRB- are going to make it work, let alone how it will work,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said At the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said, `` We've got a lot under way to do the steps the president's already announced, and that's our priority right now. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> suggested the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration had no major problems with a coalition government in which a non-communist prime minister will divide authority with a communist president, although it means the communists will still control the military, the police and the courts. He applauded <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> for `` the changes that have been made there'' over the past months toward more democracy. `` All the words I said yesterday are operable today. You may use them freely,'' said <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. On Thursday, the spokesman called movement toward a non-communist government in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> `` history-making and remarkable.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the administration would reserve formal comment on news reports that Polish President <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> had chosen Solidarity activist <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> to be the new prime minister and lead the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc's first non-communist government. Still, White House aides privately said they were pleased with the apparent choice of <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>, a journalist and close associate of Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters that letters from the president to <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> being carried by <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., were `` just letters of greeting'' and did not contain messages on the current power shuffle <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> left <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Friday on a trip that will include a visit to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said his administration would reward <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> for political reform, and he unveiled the $ 119 million package of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid during his visit to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> last month. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> budget restraints continue to be a factor in any possible boost in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid. `` We do n't have a lot of money to offer.'' `` At this point, it's just far too early to talk about signals of what we will do -LRB- in terms of more <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid -RRB- or what's available to us,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> told <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in July that <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> will need at least $ 10 billion in international aid. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allies are expected to meet in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in late September to discuss a multi-nation rescue package to supplement the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid. At the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said the next step involves `` the concerted international efforts.'' `` The Summit Seven agreed to a program of concerted efforts to promote reform in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. Twenty-four countries attended the first meeting on Aug. 1, at which food assistance was discussed. The next meeting is scheduled for late September,'' he said. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said that the new Polish government, no matter what precise form it takes, has its work cut out for it getting the nation's financial house in order. `` Economically it is going to be very difficult'' for any new government in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. He said problems would `` take a good deal of patience and determination'' to solve. The spokesman said that the White House has had no direct contact with officials in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. `` We're just watching things as they happen,'' he said. `` The situation is changing rapidly there and we would prefer not to have any further comment on the process until we reach a point where we have some assurances of how the government is going to be formed,'' he added. On another subject, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said former President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> was acting on his own in inviting warring factions in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> to meet with him in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> next month for peace talks. `` He is not acting on behalf of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government and does not have any official capacity or endorsement by us,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` Obviously, if he can be successful or be a help in pulling the parties together there, that's all for the better,'' he said. `` But it's strictly a private initiative.'' On the second day of his 2 -LCB- - week vacation, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> went boating with family members and played a round of golf <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> kept up the constant banter with reporters on the golf course that has often marked his outings here. As he teed off on the first hole, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters: `` The crowd is hushed. They sense that ` Mr. Smooth.' is back.'' Asked if he had seen a television interview the night before with Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> answered: `` No, I did n't see it last night. I'm on my vacation.''

<HEAD>Unisys To Cut 6,000 Jobs In Restructuring</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> will cut more than 6,000 jobs _ as much as 8 percent of the computer company's worldwide workforce _ by the end of 1990, in a restructuring plan announced Friday. The plan is, in effect, an acknowledgement by the hard-driving chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Blumenthal </PERSON>, that the growth plans of the nation's third-largest computer maker were too ambitious. `` The basic strategies are working as planned ... but our operational profitability has clearly been inadequate for several reasons, including the need to work off excess inventories, weaker than expected <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> demand, and sharper competition in all industry segments worldwide,'' <PERSON> Blumenthal </PERSON> said in a statement. <PERSON> Blumenthal </PERSON> had envisioned turning <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> into a $ 20 billion company by 1993 to make the company a more credible competitor to No. 1 <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Company spokesman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stugrin </PERSON> said Friday the $ 20 billion goal was merely a dollar figure indicating the growth the company wanted to achieve `` In the 1989-90 time frame, our major emphasis is operational profitability and profit margins. We're looking for growth in revenue and in market share.'' The restructuring plan, part of a review of all company operations to be completed by September, is designed to combat an unexpected drop in domestic demand and tougher competition in the industry worldwide. It follows a 67 percent drop in second-quarter earnings and a first-half loss of $ 25.1 million for the company formed in 1986 by the $ 4.8 billion purchase of <ORGANIZATION> Sperry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> by <ORGANIZATION> Burroughs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Blumenthal </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> will cut annual costs by $ 400 million by the end of 1990 Over the same period, <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> plans to cut its worldwide workforce of 88,000 by 7 to 8 percent through attrition and layoffs, <PERSON> Stugrin </PERSON> said. That amounts to between 6,000 and 7,000 workers, he said. Since <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> has been under a hiring and salary freeze since the end of the second quarter, employees who retire or leave the company will not be replaced, <PERSON> Stugrin </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Stugrin </PERSON> said a major focus of the job cuts will be in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, where he said `` the softest market conditions prevail, unfortunately.'' He said <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> had `` taken pains to make sure our people understand the trends in the industry and in the marketplace'' and that the company had `` a sense of determination to see this through and go on to better conditions.'' In the second quarter, <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> recorded net income of $ 53.6 million compared with $ 162.3 million for the same period a year earlier, the decline attributed to a drop in inventory, pricing pressure from competitors, and the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s temporary suspension of its defense business. <PERSON> Blumenthal </PERSON> had also attributed the earnings drop to the rise in the dollar, decreasing the dollar value of sales made in foreign currencies. In the first half of the year, <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> lost $ 25.1 million, compared with a profit of $ 311.6 million a year earlier. <PERSON> Blumenthal </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> is confident it will achieve positive results and greater profits in 1990. In addition to being a major computer maker, <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> is the nation's 15th largest defense contractor and received $ 1.4 billion in contracts from the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> in 1988. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s revenue this year will be nearly $ 60 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> ranks second with nearly $ 13 billion in annual revenue. <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> is third with a little under $ 10 billion in revenue.

 Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> urged <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> on Friday to release prisoners, withdraw their troops to recognized borders and resume stalled negotiations for a peace treaty. `` As we observe the anniversary of the cease-fire, I call on the leaders of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> to join me in a renewed effort to complete this task'' of implementing the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peace plan `` as the way to achieve an overall political settlement,'' he said in a statement. He called for security and stability in the region, and `` peace which only can be lasting if it is base on the principle of no victor, no vanquished.'' A U.N.-mediated cease-fire took effect Aug. 20, 1988, and peace negotiations began in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> five days later, under <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> auspices. The cease-fire has held, but talks stalled after several sessions. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> plan for withdrawal and repatriation of POWs has not been implemented and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has injected new elements, including clearing of the <LOCATION> Shatt-al-Arab </LOCATION> waterway, the southern border between the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> neighbors. In his statement, <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> plan, Security Council Resolution 598 `` can not be renegotiated. It represents a peace plan that must be implemented.'' `` Countless lives have been spared'' and tension has been reduced because of the truce, he said, but `` there is no reason for complacency, for the silencing of guns does not mean the restoration of security and stability in the region.''

 The Kremlin has decided to allow the first visit to <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> by a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senator, who plans to give a speech there urging greater independence for the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> republic </LOCATION>, officials said Friday. Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasten </PERSON>, R-Wis., was scheduled to leave Saturday for the <LOCATION> Latvian </LOCATION> capital of <LOCATION> Riga </LOCATION> where he was to take part Monday in a conference protesting the forcible annexation of the three Baltic republics by <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> during World War II He was to deliver a speech blaming Soviet authorities for environmental pollution in <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>. `` The government in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> is not accountable to the people of <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>, or even to the people of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> _ and the result is environmental disaster,'' <PERSON> Kasten </PERSON> was to say in the speech, which was provided in advance to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials, who spoke on condition they not be further identified, described the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> decision to allow <PERSON> Kasten </PERSON> to travel to <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> and deliver such a critical speech as another sign of change in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration did not object to the visit, said the officials, despite long-standing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy not to recognize <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s 1940 annexation of <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> and its two sister republics, <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>. Under this policy, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials are barred from having business contacts with senior <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and government officials in the <ORGANIZATION> Baltics </ORGANIZATION> republics. <PERSON> Kasten </PERSON> was taking part in the `` International Conference on Self-Determination,'' organized by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>. In a news release, the group described itself as `` an organization campaigning for <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>'s independence from the U.S.S.R.'' The group said other congressional visits were expected to <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> this autumn. <PERSON> Kasten </PERSON> said in his prepared remarks `` officials in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> who make decisions about the use of resources have no interest in protecting the environment of the Baltic region. Their interest is in promoting heavy industry _ and in removing the pollution caused by that industry from the region of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>.'' `` The answer is decentralization, a government closer to the people. Decisions about the <LOCATION> Latvian </LOCATION> environment need to be made by the Latvians _ the people whose children will have to inherit the <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> environment from their parents,'' said the speech. <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> scored a victory last month when the national parliament gave preliminary approval to legislation that would grant them greater economic autonomy, including the right to print their own currency, starting next Jan. 1. That autonomy would include greater control over heavy industries, which are now run by ministries based in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper Pravda signalled on Thursday that further liberalization was in the wind by suggesting a reorganization of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to grant even more power to its 15 constituent republics at the expense of central authorites in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>.

 Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s chief of staff met with a top East German official Friday but reported the two Germanies are at an impasse over ways to deal with a crush of East German refugees. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> closed its embassy in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> Monday because of the number of East Germans who went there seeking to escape to the West. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s chief of staff, <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Seiters </PERSON>, met in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> for two hours with <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s deputy foreign minister, <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Krolikowski </PERSON>. `` Unfortunately it has to be said that <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is not prepared to go beyond its original promise,'' <PERSON> Seiters </PERSON> told reporters after the meeting. Communist East <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has said would-be refugees who return voluntarily will not be punished but it has given them no assurances their applications to emigrate will be approved. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said earlier Friday that he was willing to personally take up the issue with East German leader <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> if that was necessary to ease the strained relations between the two German states. <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>'s has said the relations will become even more difficult if <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> continues to shelter more than 300 East Germans at its embassies and diplomatic missions in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has issued more than 800 passports to other East German refugees in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> who arrived after the embassy was closed. <PERSON> Seiters </PERSON> said <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> wants an impovement in relations `` but for the foreseeable future they are going to be strained.'' No further negotiations were agreed to. West German government spokesman <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmuelling </PERSON> told a news conference earlier Friday that <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> received a letter from <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> Thursday night in reply to <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s request that joint efforts be made to resolve the refugee situation. <PERSON> Schmuelling </PERSON> declined to disclose details of the letter but government sources said <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>'s message resulted in <PERSON> Seiters </PERSON>' being sent to meet with <PERSON> Krolikowski </PERSON> The failure of that meeting could put pressure on <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> to travel to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> to meet with <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>. `` There is certainly no meeting scheduled as a normal course of events, but it could be that if matters intensify at the <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> embassy, that direct contacts would be demanded,'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> ARD </ORGANIZATION> broadcast network Friday afternoon. `` I would do this immediately if it appeared necessary.'' <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> made an official trip to <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> in September 1987. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> has not returned the visit and has suggested such a meeting depends in part on improved relations. East Germans, angered at the lack of reform in their country, have been going by the hundreds to neighboring <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, which began dismantling its barbed-wire border with neutral <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> in May. East Germans can travel freely to <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> as another Soviet-bloc country. At least 1,600 East Germans are thought to have escaped undetected, based on the number of refugees showing up at the West German Embassy in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> for help in obtaining West German documents. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> sources reported Thursday that 1,100 East Germans sought papers from the <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> embassy during the first two weeks of August. East Germans are automatically entitled to West German citizenship under the West German constitution but they need exit visas from their government to go to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>.

 A reserve soldier under investigation in the beating death of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> shot himself to death with a submachine gun, and news reports Friday said he did it because he feared being blamed for the slaying. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, a village leader was killed by an assailant who suspected him of cooperating with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. The reports said <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>, 62, was shot 14 times in the chest in <PERSON> Kafr </PERSON> <PERSON> Laqif </PERSON>. The army confirmed the slaying. Awad is the 96th Palestinian killed by his fellow Arabs on suspicion of cooperating with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities. In the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, the army sealed three rooms in homes owned by Palestinians accused of attacking <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> collaborators, an army spokesman said. Troops shot and wounded three Palestinians in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, including a 17 year old who was in critical condition, Arab hospital officials said. An army spokesman said the military is investigating the incidents. Also Friday, a new security policy that requires <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> residents to show computerized identification cards before entering <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> took effect. Traffic to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> was light, but officials said that was mainly because Friday is a Moslem prayer day, not because of a strike call by <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> activists opposed to the new cards. Israeli newspapers reported that reserve soldier <PERSON> Yariv </PERSON> <PERSON> Bar-Yosef </PERSON> finished work as a night guard at the state-run television studio Thursday, put an Uzi submachine gun to his head and shot himself. In a suicide letter, <PERSON> Bar-Yosef </PERSON>, 25, said he faced questioning by military police and feared he would become a scapegoat for other soldiers involved in the beating death of <PERSON> Hani </PERSON> <PERSON> el-Shami </PERSON> in August 1988, the reports said. They quoted his letter as referring to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> as `` a land that devours its people.'' An army spokesman refused comment on the suicide, saying the case was under investigation. Four soldiers of an elite infantry brigade were charged with beating to death el-Shami while on patrol. They were acquitted of manslaughter but convicted of brutality after a military tribunal ruled that <PERSON> el-Shami </PERSON> died of beatings inflicted at the Jabaliya detention center, where he was taken after being beaten by the soldiers. <PERSON> Bar-Yosef </PERSON> served at the detention center and told investigators he kicked <PERSON> el-Shami </PERSON> in the shoulder the day he died. At least 537 Palestinians have been killed in clashes with soldiers or Israelis since the uprising against Israeli rule of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> began in December 1987. Thirty-eight Israelis have died. The army spokesman said the military sealed rooms in three <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> homes owned by Arabs accused of membership in `` popular committees,'' attacking Arabs who cooperated with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and threatening an Arab policeman who worked with the military authorities. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> says sealing or demolishing homes is necessary as a means of deterrence. The army has sealed or demolished at least 330 home in the occupied territories during the uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and European nations have condemned the measures as violations of human rights. Palestinians in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> were ordered to boycott their jobs in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, starting Friday, to protest the new ID cards. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said some <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> workers spent Thursday night in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to avoid crossing the checkpoint. Israeli officials said they introduced the cards to prevent Arabs with criminal or security records from entering <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, but <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> reporters said the new system is an attempt to put economic pressure on Gazans who work in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.

 Through tears, a grieving foster mother said she's determined to keep alive the memory of a 2-year-old she raised most of his short life so she can prove his death is worth more than 30 days' pay. The parents of <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> <PERSON> McGee </PERSON> are charged with murder. Authorities said the child was repeatedly plunged headfirst into a toilet bowl during potty training. His July 28 death set off controversy throughout <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> about handling of abuse cases. The boy might be alive today if social workers had followed their policy for protecting abused children, a state investigator concluded. Four state child care workers knew <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> was subjected to physical abuse and `` bizarre punishment'' at home, did n't report it and recommended the child be returned to his parents, the investigator said. The <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rehabilitative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> called it an error in judgment and disciplined the workers, ranging from a written reprimand to 30 days' suspension. `` A child is dead,'' said <PERSON> Pam </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON>, who wanted to adopt <PERSON> Brad </PERSON>. `` A judgment call results in a preventable death and disciplinary action is no more than 30 days without pay? Is that all a child's life is worth today? Mrs. <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> spent 14 months caring for <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> while he was under the protection of HRS. The boy died with multiple bruises on his face, abdomen, buttocks and groin. But that's not what killed the blond, blue-eyed toddler. Shoving him untold times headfirst into a toilet bowl did, the medical examiner's office said. His brain hemorrhaged. <PERSON> Brad </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Sheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> McGee </PERSON> <PERSON> Coe </PERSON>, 20, and stepfather, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Coe </PERSON>, 22, are accused of killing the boy for soiling his pants. They told police they were potty-training him. Mrs. <PERSON> Coe </PERSON> is expecting her third child later this month. Her second child, a 13-month-old girl, was placed in foster care after <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>'s death. No trial has been scheduled. <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> had been under the care of HRS since his mother abandoned him malnourished and congested when he was 4 months old. She left him with a stranger, a pretzel vendor, at a mall. Two months before his death he was returned to his parents. <PERSON> Pam </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> and her husband, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON>, had warned HRS against it. A child protection team, a group of medical and social work professionals that weigh cases for the state, had advised against it in a psychological evaluation of the parents. And on July 3, HRS received a report of abuse. The reports were not brought to the attention of a judge who approved the reunification. Others say they reported problems, but the agency says it only has record of one call to its abuse hot line. Following an investigation by the HRS inspector general, the agency suspended the caseworker without pay for 30 days, suspended an administrator without pay for three weeks, reprimanded a program director and demoted a supervisor. Since March 1988, five <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area children have died from child abuse while under HRS supervision. `` How many more children will die if nothing is done, and right away?'' Mrs. <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> asked. She is urging the governor to call a special legislative session. The state attorney is investigating handling of the case. Signatures are being collected on 20,000 petitions that ask the governor to make it tougher for parents to get their kids back. Inspector General <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Slavens </PERSON> agrees with Mrs. <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> and says the law should be changed `` so that the safety of the child comes first as opposed to family reunification.'' The first six months <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> was in HRS custody, his parents never contacted the agency, according to state reports. He called the <ORGANIZATION> Kirklands </ORGANIZATION> `` mommy'' and `` daddy.'' They called him `` Brabbee.'' `` He was happy, bright, and a clown. He loved to dance. He'd hear music and turn himself around,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON>, sitting at her dining room table surrounded by pictures of <PERSON> Brad </PERSON>. In every pose, he was smiling. `` He was also very sensitive,'' she said. Even a gentle scolding would bring tears. At the <LOCATION> Kirklands </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> rode around in a fenced yard on his favorite dump truck. When he was wet, he'd bring a clean diaper to <PERSON> Pam </PERSON> to change him. When <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON>, a teacher, came home from work, he'd race to the door giggling `` daddy home.'' `` He had so much love to give and wanted so much to be loved,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON>, fighting back tears. `` He would cling with his arms around me.'' On May 24, HRS workers took <PERSON> Brabbee </PERSON> back to the Coes. The <ORGANIZATION> Kirklands </ORGANIZATION> said they were told they could not see him again because he had bonded to them and was n't bonding to his parents. Two months later he was dead. `` What went through that child's mind,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> wondered. `` Was he thinking, ` What did I do? Why do n't they come get me?' ... And when he was unplugged from that respirator, was there anyone that loved him there to hug him?''

<HEAD>Czechoslovakia to Seek Compensation from Hungary on Project</HEAD>

 The government demanded Friday that <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> pay damages for the decision to suspend work on its part of a joint <LOCATION> Danube </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> dam project because of enviromental concerns. `` Pointing out the damages caused by the delay of construction works, the Czechoslovak side announces it will start seeking compensation,'' said a statement carried by <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION>, the official news agency. It said the <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> had been given a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> note saying `` responsibility for the one-sided decision of the Hungarian government is fully on the Hungarian side, as it was adopted in contradiction to international law.'' It did not say how much compensation would be sought or give other details. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> announced a moratorium May 13 on its part of the Gabcikovo-Nagymaros project, which involves dams, canals and power stations. Environmentalists in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, one of the most liberal Soviet bloc nations, and in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> have criticized the power project for years as a threat to wildlife and wetlands. There has been no public criticism in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, which tolerates litte dissent. Before the suspension, a Hungarian government commission called Gabcikovo-Nagymaros a `` symbol of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s mismanaged past.'' <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> says the power station it has nearly completed at <LOCATION> Gabcikovo </LOCATION>, 40 miles east of <LOCATION> Bratislava </LOCATION>, can not operate as efficiently as planned without the Nagymaros dam. `` The note confirms the Czechoslovak government's decision of May 15 to insist on honoring the agreement to construct the abovementioned water project,'' <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> reported. The agreement to build the project was signed in 1977. Hungarian construction lagged far behind the Czechoslovaks even before the suspension.

 President <PERSON> Ranasinghe </PERSON> <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> has met with leaders of a political alliance with links to radical Sinhalese and appealed for a cease-fire, an official said Friday. The official in the presidential secretariat spoke on condition he not be identified. He said <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> met with leaders of the <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> Progressive Front Thursday and suggesed a week-long cease-fire as the first step toward peace negotiations with the radicals. He said no decision was reached during the 90-minute talks. It was the first meeting between the president and the front which is believed to have close links to Sinhalese groups that have been waging a terrorist campaign against the government.

<TEXT>
 A young man charged in a group sexual assault on a 17-year-old girl surrendered to police Friday, and a warrant has issued for another suspect whose police lieutenant father investigated the case, officials said. The young man pleaded innocent before Family Court Judge <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuentes </PERSON> to charges of conspiracy to commit sexual assault and aggravated criminal sexual contact in the March 1 attack, said an official familiar with the case who spoke on condition of anonymity. The 18-year-old man, who was not identified despite his age because the alleged crime occurred when he was 17, was released to his parents' custody. On May 24, five high school students were arrested and charged with participating in the assault on a special education student in the affluent suburb of <LOCATION> Glen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION>. Officials at <ORGANIZATION> Glen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> described many of those charged as student leaders, including the captains of several school teams. Prosecutors alleged that the girl was assaulted with a broomstick and a baseball bat at the home of two of the student athletes. The girl went to <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, but lives in <LOCATION> Glen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION> and knew the suspects. <PERSON> Fuentes </PERSON> on Friday postponed until Oct. 5 a hearing on whether to try the young man and two other juveniles charged in the case as adults, the official said. The lieutenant's son, 19-year-old <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Corcoran </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, is expected to surrender Monday, the <LOCATION> Essex </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> prosecutor's office said in a news release. The release did not state when the warrant for him was issued. <PERSON> Corcoran </PERSON> is to be arraigned in <ORGANIZATION> Essex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on charges of conspiracy to commit sexual assault, aggravated sexual assault and aggravated sexual conduct, the release said. <PERSON> Corcoran </PERSON>'s father is <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridge </PERSON>'s chief detective and led the investigation into the incident. He was taken off the case five weeks after his son was identified as one of 13 people present during the assault. Prosecutors originally described <PERSON> Corcoran </PERSON> as a witness, but said the charges were brought after new evidence was obtained. Prosecutor's spokesman <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> declined to describe the evidence, saying the case was still under investigation. Prosecutors have said the attack occurred in the home of <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Scherzer </PERSON>, 18-year-old twins who have been charged in the case. Charges also were filed against <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON>, 18, and the two other juveniles. All are free on bond. A grand jury is scheduled to examine the case next month. The charges against <PERSON> Corcoran </PERSON> resulted from a joint investigation by <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridge </PERSON> police and the prosecutor's office, the release said. The probe began when it was learned the young man was present during the attack. `` The fact that charges have been filed against <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Corcoran </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> in no way implies that the <ORGANIZATION> Glen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> committed any impropriety in connection with the investigation,'' the statement said. <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridge </PERSON> police will continue to be involved in the investigation, the prosecutor's office said. <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridge </PERSON> Police Chief <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Dugan </PERSON> declined to comment on the case or Lt. <PERSON> Corcoran </PERSON>'s role in it.

<TEXT>
 Tourists have been evacuated from the resort island of Thassos in the northern <LOCATION> Aegean </LOCATION> because of a fire in its mountain woodlands, officials said Friday. `` Ferryboats have been plying back and forth ... and just about all visitors have left the island,'' said <PERSON> Christos </PERSON> <PERSON> Panagis </PERSON>, a harbor officer in <LOCATION> Kavala </LOCATION> on the mainland 90 minutes from Thassos by boat. A police officer reached by telephone on Thassos said he could not say how many tourists were evacuated but the process was orderly. An <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> radio station said <ORGANIZATION> Kavala </ORGANIZATION> fire officials believed the fire, which started in four places simultaneously, was caused by arson. Agriculture Minister <PERSON> Stavros </PERSON> <PERSON> Dimas </PERSON> said Friday that 25 percent of the fires that have destroyed 50,000 acres of forest in 10 days were started by arsonists. Air currents on the mountainous terrain of Thassos made it difficult for five fire-fighting aircraft to dump water on the fires moving toward the evacuated villages of <LOCATION> Sotiros </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kallirahi </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Agios </PERSON> <PERSON> Giorgis </PERSON>, Prinos, <PERSON> Maries </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rahoni </PERSON>, officials said.. <PERSON> Panagis </PERSON> said flames could be seen from the harbor in <LOCATION> Limeni </LOCATION>, the island's main town, but fire-breaks were expected to keep the flames away from the town Thassos was put under a state of emergency Thursday. Soldiers and fire-fighting equipment from throughout northern <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> were moved in to combat the blaze. The Thassos police officer, who would not give his name, said some barns and abandoned dwellings on the outskirts of villages had been burned. The national forest fire control center would not say how large an area had been destroyed by the fire, which began early Thursday, but unofficial estimates put it at more than 8,600 acres.

<HEAD>Court Blocks New Cost Formula For Foreclosures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal judge on Friday blocked the Department of Veterans Affairs from implementing a regulation next week on <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> home loans that the mortgage industry says will leave it holding the bag more often when borrowers default. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Revercomb </PERSON> said in his preliminary injunction that <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> appeared to have exceeded its legal authority when it added the cost of borrowing funds to its formula for determining the worth of foreclosed property. The regulations, which had been due to take effect Monday, would change the calculation to arrive at how much the property is worth, the standard <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> uses to determine whether it will purchase foreclosed properties with VA-guaranteed mortgages. The injunction remains in effect until a full hearing on the complaint by the <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> can be heard. The association, which represents some 2,200 mortgage lending institutions, said in a statement that the hearing may not take place for several months. `` This decision signals a victory for mortgage lenders, but the real beneficiaries will be veterans who will be able to continue to have access to low-downpayment VA mortgages,'' said <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Lasko </PERSON>, executive vice president of the organization. The organization says implementation of the regulation `` would have seriously impaired a program that has successfully served over 13 million veteran homebuyers.'' Under the veterans loan program, the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> guarantees to the mortgage lender that it will pay 40 percent or 50 percent of the mortgage debt if the borrower defaults. The maximum guarantee is $ 36,000. Until 1984, <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> bought the foreclosed property in nearly every case, `` even when it did not make financial sense to do so,'' <PERSON> Revercomb </PERSON> noted in his ruling. But <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, in the Deficit Reduction Act, required a `` no-bid formula'' to specify when <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> would purchase the properties. VA, under the regulations, is required to calculate what the property is worth by taking its fair market value _ the price it would command in the real estate market _ and subtracting a variety of costs. The VA would not repurchase homes that it would end up reselling at a loss. The lawsuit was filed after the VA issued regulations July 19 adding `` cost of funds'' to the net worth formula. That is the cost to the government of borrowing money to buy the foreclosed property until it can be resold. The association contends this cost is not permitted in the formula prescribed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` When the regulation at issue here goes into effect, it is undeniable that some mortgage bankers will be concretely and monetarily injured because the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> will purchase fewer foreclosed homes than it does now, thus placing more of the potential loss on the mortgage banker,'' <PERSON> Revercomb </PERSON> said. Neither VA nor the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> would comment immediately on the ruling. Foreclosure actions on VA-backed loans have risen sharply in recent years, due largely to the real estate slump in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, an arm of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, says six lenders defaulted in 1988 that had financial problems linked to the so-called `` no-bids.'' The president's budget message this year estimated the new regulation would result in 10 percent fewer property acquisitions. The industry group says its average loss on a piece of property <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> does not acquire is more than $ 18,000. According to a <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> report in July, foreclosures rose from 13,729 in fiscal 1981 to 43,316 in 1987. In those same two years, <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> annual losses rose from $ 51 million to $ 615 million, <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said. The industry group says its losses from <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION>'s refusal to bid on foreclosed property totaled $ 200 million last year. The report by <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>, the investigative arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, supported the new regulations.

<TEXT>
 The Voyager 2 space probe discovered that a magnetic field surrounds <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>, suggesting the planet is enveloped by orbiting radiation belts and has an aurora like <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>'s northern lights, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> announced Friday Further study of the magnetic field should allow scientists to determine the exact length of a day on <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>, believed to be 17 to 18 Earth hours, and to gain better understanding of <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s internal structure, said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Murrill </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Just as <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>'s magnetic field traps the <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> radiation belts, <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s magnetic field also may help create radiation belts around that planet. Scientists do n't yet know if that poses a hazard to Voyager 2's electronic components, <PERSON> Murrill </PERSON> said. Voyager was 2.74 billion miles from <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and 5.92 million miles from <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> on Friday, speeding toward the giant gas planet at 42,236 mph. The spacecraft was launched in 1977 and explored Jupiter in 1979, <ORGANIZATION> Saturn </ORGANIZATION> in 1981 and Uranus in 1986. Voyager 2 will make its closest approach to <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> at 8:59 p.m. PDT on Thursday when it flies about 3,000 miles over the cloudtops of the solar system's fourth-largest planet. Voyager already has discovered four Neptunian moons in addition to the two discovered from <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, two partial rings, or ring arcs, of debris orbiting the planet; and atmospheric patterns similar to jet streams and giant cyclones on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. Discovery of <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s magnetic field was confirmed Friday by intense, pulse-like radio emissions coming from the planet's vicinity Radio waves are generated when high-speed electrically charged particles spiral into a planet's atmosphere along magnetic field lines. `` Mercury, <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, Jupiter, <ORGANIZATION> Saturn </ORGANIZATION> and Uranus have magnetic fields, while <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> and Mars do not,'' the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said in a news release. `` Whether <LOCATION> Pluto </LOCATION> has one or not is unknown. `` A planetary magnetic field is a girdle of magnetic field lines that surround a planet,'' the agency said. `` Such fields are thought to be generated by fluid motion in a planet's core. -LRB- Molten iron in <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>'s core, for example -RRB-.'' Certain electrically charged particles in space spiral along magnetic field lines toward <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>'s poles, creating the northern and southern lights. A magnetic field at <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> means that planet also may have auroras, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said. Scientists hope the magnetic field will allow them to understand <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s internal structure. Voyager project scientist <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> has said he believes that <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s hydrogen-helium outer atmosphere gradually gives way to a superhot slurry of hot water and rock closer to the planet's center. That would mean that <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> _ like neighboring <LOCATION> Uranus </LOCATION> _ probably lacks a distinct sky-sea boundary. Some scientists believe radiation trapped by Uranus' magnetic field bombards frozen natural gas on that planet's moons and rings to turn them dark in color. <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s magnetic field may cause similar radiation darkening of the Neptunian moons and ring arcs, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said. The nature of <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s radio signal allowed scientists to determine the emissions came from a magnetic field, not from discharges of lightning in the atmosphere, said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Warwick </PERSON>, head of <PERSON> Voyager </PERSON>'s radio science team. `` The radio emissions are very intense, very impulsive and occur in a limited range of frequency,'' <PERSON> Warwick </PERSON>, a scientist at <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION>, Colo.-based <ORGANIZATION> Radiophysics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said in the release. Once <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> confirmed the existence of <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s magnetic field Friday, scientists found evidence for the telltale radio signals in data collected by <PERSON> Voyager </PERSON> as early as Monday. `` Early analysis indicates <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s magnetic field is of an intensity similar to the fields of <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and Uranus,'' <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Murrill </PERSON> said scientists do n't yet know how <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s magnetic field is aligned. Voyager found the axis of Uranus' magnetic field was tilted about 60 degrees from the axis around which that planet spins. Earth's north magnetic pole is tilted about 14 degrees from the planet's north rotational axis.

 <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> suspended negotiations Friday with the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> for 10 days because of escalating attacks on company employees and destruction of company property, the company said. President <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Odom </PERSON> said their workers are subjected daily to threats of personal injury and physical violence. `` Meaningful negotiations are impossible when one party is employing fear and terrorism as its principal negotiating technique,'' he said. Earlier this week, two <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> employees were injured when they were hit by rocks as they were driving home from work, two employee vehicles were burned, a company building was destroyed by fire and numerous coal trucks were damaged, according to state police. <PERSON> Odom </PERSON> said one of the employees was still hospitalized Friday after suffering compound fractures of his fingers, a broken nose and multiple cuts and bruises. No one had been arrested in the incidents, but <PERSON> Odom </PERSON> blamed the union for the violence. `` While giving lip service to non-violence the union has yet to take any public steps deploring the acts of violence or to discipline agents or members for the thousands of violent acts that have occurred since the strike began April 5,'' <PERSON> Odom </PERSON> said in a statement released from his <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> office. <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> was avoiding its obligation to help settle the contract dispute. `` The company has been trying to find a way to walk away from the mediation process ... and <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> is using this gesture as a subterfuge to continue its pattern of bad-faith bargaining,'' <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> said. He said the union remains `` ready and willing'' to continue mediation. $ Contract talks were to have resumed Tuesday at a motel in <LOCATION> Duffield </LOCATION> There had been no progress in the negotiations in which the union and company representatives gathered in separate conference rooms, with a federal mediator relaying messages. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, who initiated the resumption of negotiations July 18 after they broke off in June, said Tuesday he was optimistic the parties would soon be meeting and get the talks off dead center. <PERSON> Odom </PERSON> said the union should be willing to denounce the violence and to instruct its members that strike benefits will be withdrawn from those involved in the violent acts. `` To do less would amount to a tacit approval.'' The strike involves <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION>'s 1,695 union workers in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 One quarter or more of the Earth's species of animals, plants, microbes and fungi will become extinct without measures to preserve them, a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> study said Friday. The study called for increased efforts in basic research and education in an effort to preserve both individual species and complete ecological systems. `` Unless the international community can reverse the trend,'' the report said, `` the rate of extinction over the next few years is likely to rise to at least 1,000 times the normal background rate of extinction and will ultimately result in the loss of a quarter or more of the species on Earth.'' The report said that about 1.4 million species throughout the world have been identified and named, but it estimated that the total number of species may range from 5 million to 80 million. In the tropics and subtropices, the study said, there are 400,000 identified species, but the actual number of species in those regions may be at least 3 million and perhaps as high as 30 million. The report called for increased efforts to identify and classify the world's animals, plants, microbes and fungi, and to understand the ecosystems in which they live. It called for greater support by the federal government of such scientific studies. The <ORGANIZATION> NSF </ORGANIZATION> study also recommended greater efforts in education, noting that teaching the young about biology and the environment `` is now as important to the national interest as early education in mathematics and other sciences.''

In an interview in its Aug. 21 issue, <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> quotes <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Brunner </PERSON>, 21, as saying he's not proud of being <PERSON> Manson </PERSON>'s son and considers his father an `` evil person'' he has never tried to contact. <PERSON> Kaplan </PERSON> said he decided to find <PERSON> Manson </PERSON>'s son after a recent series of news stories marking the 20th anniversary of the <ORGANIZATION> Sharon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tate </ORGANIZATION> murders. `` Buried in one of the stories was the fact that <PERSON> Manson </PERSON> had a son,'' <PERSON> Kaplan </PERSON> said. `` That intrigued me and I said, ` Let's find him.' ... `` We went back to the clippings and ` Helter Skelter' and found the name <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Brunner </PERSON>,'' the boy's mother, he said. Star determined that the baby was taken back to <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Brunner </PERSON>'s hometown in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> to live with her parents, who adopted the boy `` We sent a reporter and the apple simply fell off the tree,'' <PERSON> Kaplan </PERSON> said. `` It took us one day.'' <PERSON> Brunner </PERSON> agreed to be interviewed on the condition that the magazine not reveal where he lives, <PERSON> Kaplan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Brunner </PERSON> was 16 months old when <PERSON> Manson </PERSON>'s followers murdered actress <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> and four others in August 1969, <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> says. His mother, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Brunner </PERSON>, was reportedly a member of <PERSON> Manson </PERSON>'s so-called family but was in jail when the murders occurred for trying to use a stolen credit card. ` It's been out there all this time,'' <PERSON> Kaplan </PERSON> said. `` The ripples stayed in this relatively small community and out of the local newspaper.''

<HEAD>Appeals Court Grants New Trial For Man Convicted in Palme Slaying</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An appeals court agreed Friday to a hold a new trial next month for the man convicted in the slaying of Prime Minister <PERSON> Olof </PERSON> <PERSON> Palme </PERSON>, the national <ORGANIZATION> TT </ORGANIZATION> news agency said. <PERSON> Christer </PERSON> <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON> was sentenced to life in prison last month after his conviction. <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON>, a 42 year old with a lengthy criminal record, denied shooting the four-term prime minister and appealed. The prosecution also appealed because it wanted to convict <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON> of attempted murder in the wounding of <LOCATION> Palme </LOCATION>'s widow, <PERSON> Lisbeth </PERSON>, in the attack in February 1986. <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON> was convicted of the lesser charge of endangering Mrs. <PERSON> Palme </PERSON>'s life. In <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, reviews by appellate courts are automatic if either side appeals, but the appellate court has the choice of either recalling witnesses or simply reviewing the records of the lower court. The makeup of the appeals court differs from the district court, in that a majority on the jury are professional jurists and a minority are lay jurors. In the district court, the six lay jurors voted to convict <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON> and the two judges voted to acquit. The new trial will begin Sept. 12 in the <ORGANIZATION> Svea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, the TT news agency said. <PERSON> Palme </PERSON> was shot Feb. 28, 1986 while walking home from a movie with his wife. Mrs. <PERSON> Palme </PERSON> claimed she saw <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON> a few feet away immediately after her husband was shot. Another witness, however, testified he saw <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON> at a train station nowhere near the scene of the shooting a short while after the murder. Defense attorney <PERSON> Arne </PERSON> <PERSON> Liljeros </PERSON> said a new witness who did not testify at the first trial also claims to have seen <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON> at the train station.

<TEXT>
 Politburo member <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Yakovlev </PERSON> conceded in an interview published today that there was no doubt that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> secretly agreed to divide <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Yakovlev </PERSON>, who heads a parliamentary panel charged with finding the truth about the 1939 Molotov-Ribbentrop pact, is the first member of the ruling Politburo to reverse decades of <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> denials that secret protocols dividing <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and the Baltic states existed. `` There was, without doubt, a collusion,'' he told the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily. He said the agreements should be `` unequivocally condemned.'' The issue is at the heart of a drive by <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> to gain more independence from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> by challenging the legitimacy of its control over the Baltic region. <PERSON> Yakovlev </PERSON>, echoing an approach taken in the past few weeks among Soviet historians, denied that the secret pact had any bearing on the Baltic states' current legal status. `` It is necessary to admit that neither the treaty nor protocol determined the legal and political status of <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` It is even more far-fetched to seek some kind of interrelation between the present status of the three republics and the non-aggression treaty.'' `` I believe that we'll be acting responsibly and in a politically principled way by having unequivocally condemned the pre-war Soviet leadership's deviation from Leninist principles of foreign policy, no matter how it is explained,'' he added. Soviet history books contend the Baltic republics voluntarily joined the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> subscribes to many Balts' claims that they were forced into the union by the occupying <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and does not recognize the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> annexation The republics plan a series of protests and other events to commemorate the anniversary of the pact on Wednesday, including a human chain stretching from <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Yakovlev </PERSON>'s commission has not issued its formal conclusions, but members have said publicly the report will say the protocols existed and condemn them. For decades, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> denied the existence of the secret protocols to the non-aggression pact, which was signed by foreign ministers <PERSON> Joachim </PERSON> <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Ribbentrop </PERSON> and <PERSON> Vyacheslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Molotov </PERSON> one week before <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> invaded <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Woman Sentenced for Murder 21 Years Ago</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WAUKEGAN, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A woman who disappeared after being accused of killing her lover 21 years ago, only to be found earlier this year, was sentenced Friday to one to three years in prison for manslaughter. `` It's all over now, except for her to do her time,'' Assistant State's Attorney <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Collina </PERSON> said after <PERSON> Bernice </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Heise </PERSON>, 63, was sentenced by <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Circuit Judge <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartel </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Heise </PERSON> will be eligible for parole in nine months, the <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> prosecutor's office said Ms. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Heise </PERSON>, who lived quietly for years as wife and mother <PERSON> Gretta </PERSON> <PERSON> Knickerbocker </PERSON>, said she had mixed feelings about the guilty plea she entered last month in the Jan. 31, 1968, shooting death of <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>. `` I did it for all my children in their new lives,'' she told reporters in this county seat nearly 25 miles north of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` I did n't want them dragged through this thing.'' Prosecutors agreed to drop murder charges in exchange for Ms. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Heise </PERSON>'s guilty plea. `` We did n't pursue murder charges because some of the evidence was old and some of the memories were beginning to fade,'' <PERSON> Collina </PERSON> said. In 1968, <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Heise </PERSON> had been having an affair for about a year, prosecutors said. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>, a 48-year-old <LOCATION> Glenview </LOCATION> artist, was shot when he told his lover he was leaving her to return to his wife and children, prosecutors said. `` She claimed that the shooting was an accident and that she was handing the gun to <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> when it discharged and he was shot,'' Assistant State's Attorney <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Waller </PERSON> said Friday. `` Strangely, he was shot in the back of the head.'' <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>' widow, <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>, and her two daughters were in court for the sentencing. `` There's no way that anybody's going to make up for what happened,'' she said. `` But I'm very happy it's been taken care of.'' Shortly after <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>' death, a judge rejected the filing of a murder charge on the basis of insufficient evidence. A grand jury later indicted Ms. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Heise </PERSON> on murder charges, but she had disappeared. The indictment was withdrawn in 1975. Investigators took up the case again after a friend of Ms. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Hiese </PERSON>'s daughter was overheard discussing the case. Ms. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Heise </PERSON> was re-indicted in February after authorities located her in the rural town of <LOCATION> Elburn </LOCATION>, about 40 miles west of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. She and her husband of 20 years, <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> <PERSON> Knickerbocker </PERSON>, had moved there in 1976 from the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Hinsdale </LOCATION>.

 A <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> MD-80 airliner landed safely Friday at <LOCATION> Lambert </LOCATION> <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> after an engine came apart on takeoff and a two-foot piece of it narrowly missed a man on the ground. `` I heard a large explosion and then I heard a lot of debris hitting the roof,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Erp </PERSON>, 29, manager of an auto body shop in <LOCATION> Kinloch </LOCATION>, next to <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>' Lambert airport. `` Then a big hunk came through the roof and hit the floor about 10 or 15 feet from me,'' he said. `` I had been walking that way. Needless to say, I just dived away. I did n't know if there was more coming.'' Officials said Flight 223 from <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> had just taken off about 10:15 a.m. when passengers heard a loud pop and the pilot announced that the plane was returning to the airport. The plane made a routine landing and there were no injuries, said <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>. <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> said the flight was canceled, and the 112 passengers were put on another flight. <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> said the engine was designed to eject loose parts to minimize problems. `` We understand some pieces fell, and we're investigating,'' <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> said <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> said the engine part that fell was a cone, the rear cover for one of the plane's <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Whitney </LOCATION> engines. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said a piece of cowling that wraps around the engine apparently came off. <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON> said the plane could have been flown safely without the cowling but that the pilot probably did the right thing by aborting the flight. `` Given the fact that we have 19,000 flights per day in this country, we may have one report like this a month,'' <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> said the plane was being examined to determine the cause of the engine failure. <PERSON> Erp </PERSON> said the engine part that fell into his shop was a metal cone about 2 feet long that weighed about 15 pounds. He said it ripped a 5-foot-square hole in the roof of the building. `` We started to pick it up but it was red hot,'' he said. `` It was still too hot to touch about 30 minutes later.'' <PERSON> Erp </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> officials who reclaimed the debris were at the shop only briefly. `` They just took the cone and picked up some smaller pieces and left,'' Erp said. `` They did n't say a whole lot. I guess they did n't want to talk about it.''

<TEXT>
 Nine Laotian children orphaned by the murder-suicide of their parents following a tense 6 -LCB- - hour hostage drama were in the temporary custody of relatives Friday, authorities said Church and county counselors said they have begun to look for permanent homes for the youngsters. <PERSON> Bao </PERSON> <PERSON> Cha </PERSON>, mother of the children, ages one to 13, was fatally shot Thursday evening by her husband, <PERSON> Dang </PERSON> <PERSON> Cha </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiong </PERSON>, who then put the handgun to his own head as eight of their nine children huddled in another room of their apartment. The ninth child, a 12-year-old boy, fled from the apartment earlier through a window and alerted police that his father was inside with a handgun, threatening his mother and playing Russian roulette with the other children. None of the children was injured. Deputy Police Chief <PERSON> Lucian </PERSON> <PERSON> Neely </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dang </PERSON>, 35, had been convicted last year of two misdemeanor counts of abuse and cruelty to his children, and was prohibited under the terms of his probation from visiting his wife or children. <PERSON> Neely </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dang </PERSON> served four months in county jail on the original cruelty charges, and that he was returned to jail twice since then, in January and again in June, for violating terms of his probation by visiting his family. <PERSON> Dang </PERSON> had been released from jail on the most recent probation violation on Monday, and <PERSON> Neely </PERSON> said investigators believe that he went to his wife's apartment Thursday because he blamed her for his probation violation arrest. `` There's no way I can ever say what the motive was, but the timing suggests something related to that,'' the deputy chief said of the probation violations. More than 50 officers surrounded the home in a neat apartment complex populated largely by Asian refugee families near the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> campus. Hostage negotiators talked with Dang by telephone for several hours. <PERSON> Neely </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dang </PERSON> sounded cooperative on the telephone. But after <PERSON> Dang </PERSON> said he would surrender and lay down his gun, police heard four shots. Officers rushed the apartment and found the children in a front room and the two wounded parents in a rear bedroom. The mother was pronounced dead within minutes and the father about two hours later. Police did not fire any shots during the siege, <PERSON> Neely </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Neely </PERSON> said officers originally believed that several of the hostages were children of neighbors, but that later interviews with family members confirmed all nine were <PERSON> Dang </PERSON>'s children. He said the children spent Thursday night with relatives, and that county <ORGANIZATION> Child </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protective </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> officers and representatives of church-related refugee services agencies were jointly taking responsibility for arranging permanent placement of the children. <PERSON> Stockton </PERSON> has a large community of refugees from <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> served by several public and volunteer social service agencies. Five <PERSON> Stockton </PERSON> children killed last Jan. 17 by a deranged gunman in a school yard were also refugees from <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, as were most of the 29 children wounded in that attack. In a statement Friday, <PERSON> Stockton </PERSON> Mayor <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Fass </PERSON> noted that earlier incident, and the image of her city projected by another incident involving refugee children. `` I think it's the media that's giving the city a bad reputation. It's a hostage situation, a family feud like that happens, unfortunately, in every major city in the country,'' <PERSON> Fass </PERSON> said.

 A truck carrying 40,000 rounds of ammunition for warplanes went up in flames and explosions early Friday, killing the driver, injuring her husband and closing an interstate for hours, authorities said. The tractor-trailer rig, loaded with 20mm shells for aircraft cannon, veered off Interstate 17 into a ditch and caught fire in a remote area about 30 miles north of <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> around 1 a.m., officials said. `` The shells kept exploding; it was like fireworks,'' said Rock Springs Fire Chief <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>. `` There were shells for about 100 yards on either side. You could n't walk without stepping on one.'' Although no evacuations were necessary, the sporadic explosions kept authorities at bay until about 5:30 a.m., <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said. The body of the driver, <PERSON> Lois </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>, 38, of <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, was n't found for hours because of the danger, said <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> Her 33-year-old husband, <PERSON> Rick </PERSON>, was in serious condition at <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Boulay </PERSON> said. The backup on I-17, the major link between <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Flagstaff </LOCATION>, stretched 10 miles and traffic was delayed up to two hours, <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> said. The highway was not fully reopened until all it had been cleared of shells more than 14 hours after the accident. People were kept several hundred yards from the accident scene as a four-person Army explosives team recovered 400 of an estimated 600 unexploded shells, <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> said. `` There is no way we could recover everything today,'' he said. `` This armament is spread throughout this area.'' The truck, hauling the ammunition from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huachuca </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vista </LOCATION> in southeast <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> to the <ORGANIZATION> Navajo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Depot </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Flagstaff </LOCATION>, apparently was traveling through a storm when it veered left into a guardrail, <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> said it was not known what caused the truck to veer. `` The whole load came forward, crushing the cab,'' <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> said. `` Some of the ammunition was thrown. The fire was all-consuming.'' <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>, who was sleeping while his wife drove, apparently crawled several hundred yards across the interstate to the Rock Springs general store. By the time officials were able to approach the truck, all but a few boxes of the ammunition had exploded, <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> said. Spent casings littered the area. The shipment being hauled under a contract with the military originated in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, said Lt.

 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s grand plans for its 40th National Day, including an impressive military parade, have been scrapped, official reports said Thursday. The celebrations that had been scheduled for Oct. 1 _ marking the establishment of <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> rule over <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in 1949 _ were to have been the most elaborate in five years. <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> <PERSON> Xitong </PERSON> said no military parade was planned this year, apparently to avoid reminding people of the tanks that in June rolled down the streets of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> to crush a popular, seven-week democracy movement. In 1984, <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> celebrated the 35th anniversary with a full day of festivities in <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, beginning with a two-hour military parade that included a 1,200-piece military band, 18 formations of foot soldiers and 24 formations of military equipment including anti-tank missiles, rocket mine-laying vehicles, and artillery. Senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> reviewed the troops from an open-roofed Red Flag limousine and addressed the nation from the rostrum of <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION>'s northern gate where <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON> had proclaimed the founding of the People's Republic of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. A similar display of pageantry was expected this year, but leaders apparently feel the mood is not right for such a celebration. Martial law, enacted on May 20, remains in effect in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, and troops armed with assault rifles have guarded the city since the military crackdown on June 3-4.

 <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, the black general nominated to head the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>, credited his rise Thursday to equal opportunity in the military that, he said, does not exist in all of society. Citing his own nomination and the choice of a woman as first captain of the cadet corps at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journalists </ORGANIZATION>: `` Almost all barriers have now dropped.'' It remains for all society, he said, to follow the lead of the military in providing equal opportunity. `` If you look at the armed forces of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> you see the kind of opportunity for advancement that regrettably does not exist in every part of our society, even within your own profession,'' <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said. It was, he said, `` the kind of opportunity that we have led the way with and hopefully will eventually spread to all parts of our society. So that achievement, recognition, should be a function solely of performance.'' <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, 52, formerly national security adviser to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, was nominated as the nation's most senior military leader by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> last week. If confirmed by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, he would be the first black in the job. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> suggested to the journalists' group what he said would have been the best second paragraph to news stories on his nomination: `` Gen. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>'s appointment would not have been possible without the sacrifices of those black soldiers who served this great nation in war for over 300 years previously.'' `` The real story is that yes, I climbed. I climbed well, I climbed hard and I climbed over the cliff,'' he said. `` But always on the backs, on the contributions of those who went before. `` Your challenge and my challenge is to tell our young people throughout the land, black, white, whatever coloration, that they've got to prepare themselves They've got to be ready. `` I may have crossed over and climbed the cliff with the help of many others.'' <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said. `` But now that we're on top of that cliff and looking ahead there are still more rivers to cross, and our young people have to be ready.''

 A teen-ager who had accused <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukens </PERSON> of having sex with her was ordered held in custody Thursday on two charges filed by her mother. <ORGANIZATION> Franklin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Juvenile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> referee <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Liston </PERSON> ruled that <PERSON> Rosie </PERSON> <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON> is out of control and that he would hold her until trial. A trial date was not set, but it is to be held within 10 days. Ms. <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON>, 17, was arrested Wednesday and charged with criminal damaging and menacing, based on complaints filed by her mother, <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>. The referee's decision was made after <PERSON> Rosie </PERSON> <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON>'s first court appearance on the charges. <PERSON> Rosie </PERSON> <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON>'s allegations against <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> led to his May 26 conviction and subsequent sentencing on a misdemeanor charge of contributing to the unruliness of a minor. The 58-year-old Republican was sentenced to 30 days in jail and fined $ 500 by <LOCATION> Franklin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Domestic Relations Court Judge <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Solove </PERSON>. The aggravated menacing charge stemmed from a July 27 incident in which <PERSON> Rosie </PERSON> <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON> allegedly threatened to hit her mother with a telephone. According to testimony, <PERSON> Rosie </PERSON> would not get off the phone when asked by her mother. The criminal damaging charge resulted from an incident on Aug. 13 at the Coffman residence. According to testimony, <PERSON> Rosie </PERSON> <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON> tried to pry open a door to the house after she was locked out. <PERSON> Rosie </PERSON> <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON> was being held in the county's juvenile detention center. The girl and her mother were key figures in <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION>' trial. <PERSON> Rosie </PERSON> <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON> claimed she was paid by <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> to have sex with him at his <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> apartment last November, when she was 16. She said <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> knew she was underage at the time. <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON>'s complaint to <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> television station <ORGANIZATION> WSYX </ORGANIZATION> late last year led to an investigation that resulted in <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION>' indictment in February She testified that during a meeting with <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> at a fast-food restaurant in November, <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> offered to find her a government job after she confronted him with accusations that he had sex with her daughter.

 There are certainly enough crass, venal motivations at the networks to go around. But to hear some of the makers of TV movies talk, there are some loftier goals as well. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodward </PERSON> are allowing a made-for-TV production for <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> of their book `` The Final Days,'' in hopes of reminding people about the constitutional crisis and the personal drama behind Watergate. So maybe they'll make a few bucks, too. Prosecutor <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Hynes </PERSON>, who reaped a lovely free ticket to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> to sit in a hot room with a lot of TV critics, is cooperating on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Howard Beach: Making the Case for Murder.'' He hopes it will enlighten the public about the much-publicized case of a vicious <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> racial attack. <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> is cooperating with the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> movie `` Drug Wars: The <PERSON> Kiki </PERSON> <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> <PERSON> Story </PERSON>,'' based on her book, `` Desperados: Latin Drug Lords, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Lawmen, and The War America Ca n't Win,'' in hopes it will inspire the public to demand that the government get serious about the drug problem. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> is also making a movie about the Challenger disaster, <PERSON> Rock </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>'s battle against AIDS, a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> child molestation case and the so-called `` preppy murder,'' a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> sex-and-death case that made headlines for months. `` There's no question these ripped-from-the-news stories make it a lot easier for television programmers to go out and market a film. The audience has heard about them,'' said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabinson </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s vice president for motion pictures for television and miniseries. `` And there's no question we have some predilection to do them and do a lot of them. The question that we're sitting and asking is, is there a reason to do it that goes beyond simply getting a -LRB- rating -RRB- number?'' Some of the movies are made without the permission of the real-life participants, but are based on material in the public domain, such as news accounts or trial transcripts. <PERSON> Sabinson </PERSON> said `` Unspeakable Acts,'' about the molestation of tots at a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> day-care center, will serve the purpose of teaching the public the warning signs of child abuse. `` Challenger,'' about the space shuttle explosion, aims to educate audiences on the risks of technological achievement. `` The Preppy Murder'' will try to reveal the anguish of the victim's family, not just because of the crime, but because of the ensuing publicity. Whether the family will welcome even more publicity in the form of the TV movie remains to be seen. <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON>, the producer of `` <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Beach </PERSON>,'' said he hopes the film will present the facts of the case accurately and let the public draw from it what they will. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Travanti </PERSON> portrays <PERSON> Hynes </PERSON> in the movie about the successful prosecution of a group of white youths charged with attacking a group of blacks and chasing one of them to his death on a highway. `` If it saves the life, or if it saves the trauma of one single family,'' <PERSON> Hynes </PERSON> said, `` it's worth it.'' `` Drug Wars'' is a real-life tale produced by <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>, whose `` Miami Vice'' was a stylized, fictional homage to drug-fighting cops. <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON>, a journalist whose investigative book is an angry account of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s anti-drug policies and their effect on the agents in the field, said she was impressed by the authenticity of the movie, directed by <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON>. `` There are anecdotes that are compressed in time. You have to do that in order to get it intelligible for television, but I am very satisfied that the spirit of the story is there, and it's real,'' she said. <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> said the movie will not depict the torture and murder of <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Guadalajara-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> agent killed by traffickers. `` I would never put that scene in,'' he said. `` It would be too strong. It's not to the point. What is to the point is the people's reactions to the fact of it.'' <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON> attended a news conference with the makers of the three-hour `` Final Days.'' He said he would have preferred that the book be made into the stage play, but praised the TV movie, in which <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> plays <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>. `` I feel strongly, you know, that we need to know about what happened in this epoch of our history, and what this president did,'' <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON> said. `` A lot of people in this country do n't know about it, or they've forgotten about it.''

<HEAD>The 1990s</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 If you take the long-term view of investing, the 1990s should be profitable for you. If, for instance, you invested $ 1,000 in a good growth stock and reinvested the dividends immediately you might expect your investment to grow to more than $ 2,500 by the end of the decade. High-cost financial advisers and portfolio managers might brag about that result, but it is well within the ability of most ordinary investors, and it need not involve an inordinate amount of risk. For your $ 1,000 to reach that figure would involve a return of about 11 percent a year, a rate that might not seem very high in these days of instant wealth. Compounding, however, works wonders, but compounding takes time. While any investment involves the risk of loss, many conservative investors will do much better than that. Over the longer term, such as a full decade, the percentages are strongly in favor of equity investments. Had you invested $ 1,000 back in 1974, and left it there along with all the dividends it earned, you might have had more than $ 5,500 by the end of 1988. Extraordinary? No. That was just normal. In fact, during that time the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500-stock index rose by the very percentage that generated the 5 -LCB- - fold increase If you had done only as well as the market, rather than having beaten it, you would have had $ 5,622. That sum was achieved at an annual rate of 12 percent a year. <ORGANIZATION> Wright </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Bridgeport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, adviser and portfolio manager that endorses conservative, patient, long-term investing, foresees the probability of investors earning around 11 percent in the next five years. While history alone might support such an expectation, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> reasons from the present. This is how it arrives at the figure. Based on the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500-stock index, corporate earnings growth should be at a 5 percent to 6 percent compound annual rate of growth. The average dividend yield is likely to be between 3.5 percent and 4 percent. These two factors produce a 9 percent rate of earned return, but economic conditions could add another 2 percent annual appreciation via increases in price-earnings ratios, or the number of times earnings at which stocks sell. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s forecast was made earlier this year, but the rationale still applies. The basis for its higher P-E multiples is an expectation of declining interest rates. That, it figures, justifies a P-E of 12 to 13. In other words, the market over the next five years is expected to roughly equal its long-term performance. Said <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>: `` Investors accustomed to the high returns typical since 1982 will have to scale back their expectations.'' Scale back their expectations? Yes, in order to raise expectations about their returns. As long-term investors know, scaling back long-term expectations to 11 percent means more money in the bank than scaling up short-term dreams. Based on the past, the norm is n't bad. It can raise your investment to 2.5 times its original value in less than a decade. Acting with prudence, many investors can do better than the norm, and some will do very much better. While the past is a guide, nobody can say with certainty what the 1990s will mean for investors. The character of decades has been one of uniqueness rather than similarity, and the 1990s are likely to follow in that pattern. Way back, says <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, it was the Roaring Twenties, followed by the Threadbare Thirties. Then came the Fighting Forties. We sailed through the Fabulous Fifties, built dreams in the Speculative Sixties, and paid for our excesses in the Stagnant Seventies. And the 1980s? We're still trying to figure them out; they're the Enigmatic Eighties. Long-term investors are now trying to get the measure of the 1990s. They can not see to the end of the decade, but as the beginning nears they are hoping for normalcy. They want it to be the Normal Nineties. Normal will do.

 Each morning the men of <LOCATION> Jon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Frum </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION>, at the foot of the smoking and rumbling Yasur volcano, raise the American flag and pray the Americans to come back to this primitive <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> island. In a hut beside the flag pole is a crudely lettered board declaring it to be <ORGANIZATION> Jon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Frum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Custom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Headquarters </ORGANIZATION>. `` We believe the Americans will come and bring us cargo,'' said <PERSON> Jonas </PERSON> <PERSON> Malman </PERSON>, a villager. `` <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Frum </PERSON> is a spirit, he will bring the cargo.'' The islanders say <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Frum </PERSON> is a spirit who appeared as an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soldier in World War II and handed out supplies to the people of <PERSON> Tanna </PERSON>, one of the chain of islands that make up <LOCATION> Vanuatu </LOCATION>. No trace of a <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Frum </PERSON> has been found in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military records. The villagers live in grass huts, have no electricity or running water and few posessions. But they have never forgotten the Americans in World War II and the fabulous cargoes of clothing, vehicles, soft drinks, gum, candy, cigarettes and canned food they brought with them on their way to fight the Japanese. The people of <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Frum </PERSON> <PERSON> Village </PERSON> and thousands more on this densely jungled island of 17,000 Melanesians believe if they can find the right magic the Americans will return and bestow them with wealth, meaning cargo. The <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Frum </PERSON> movement is one of several so-called cargo cults that exist in <LOCATION> Melanesia </LOCATION>, a group of islands stetching from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION>. They believe the cargo they see arriving by ship and plane was sent to them by their ancestors. But white man's magic has kept them from getting it. Cults like the <ORGANIZATION> Jon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Frum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> are always on the lookout for help from a powerful man who may have strong magic. One cult on <PERSON> Tanna </PERSON> worships the Duke of <LOCATION> Edinburgh </LOCATION>, the husband of Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, and believes he originally came from <PERSON> Tanna </PERSON>. They think he has the power to help get them cargo. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION>, a cult sought to buy President <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> because they had been told he was the most powerful man in the world. Since his name was on all the <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> outboard motors they used on their canoes, they saw little reason to doubt the claim. The <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Frum </PERSON> movement is one of the oldest of <LOCATION> Vanuatu </LOCATION>'s cargo cults. Its origins are obscure. Some anthropologists say it may actually date back to the 1930s and could have arisen as a reaction to missionary efforts to abolish traditonal customs such as polygamy and drinking kava, a potent local brew. The movement got a powerful boost during World War II when many Tannese were sent to other islands to work for the Americans who used the islands, then called <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hebrides </LOCATION>, as a staging base in their <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> campaign. When the Tannese saw black American soldiers handling cargo and getting food and supplies like the white man they were impressed by their magic. At this time, according to studies of the cult, the Tannese believe <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Frum </PERSON> reappeared as a black medical corpsman. The movement adopted the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> as their insigna. They planted dozens of wooden red crosses at the foot of their volcano in the hope this would encourage the return of <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Frum </PERSON> and the cargo. After the Americans moved on, a Tannese declared himself king of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and built a crude airstrip in the jungle with a bamboo replica of a control tower and `` radios'' made of tin cans and string hoping to attract planes to land, as they had seen them land at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> air bases. Others built copies of refrigerators, opening the doors several times a day hoping to find cold beer the way they Amercians had done. The British and French who jointly governed the New Hebrides until 1980 outlawed the cult and frequently jailed its leaders. The national government that followed also curbed its activities. But the <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Frum </PERSON> movement continues to flourish on this dark, rugged island dominated by the smoking 900-foot volcano, whose ash is slowly choking large areas of once-productive coconut plantation around the village. Friday is the cult's sabbath and followers meet at <LOCATION> Sulphur </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. They dance and drink kava on Saturday night. By Sunday they are too tired to go to the missonary church. <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Frum </PERSON>'s followers expect him to return each Feb. 15, but they do n't know which year and they do n't get despondent when he does n't appear Chief <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON> <PERSON> Wan </PERSON>, headman of the <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Frum </PERSON> village, tells visitors that Christians waited a long time for the Redeemer.

 <PERSON> Maryam </PERSON> d'Abo winged here in the dead of night to talk about her role as a vampire in a new movie for <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>. Her flight, during a break in filming a miniseries in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, was by jet. Her character <PERSON> Angelique </PERSON> in `` Nightlife'' is too much of a reluctant vampire to spread her wings, even for a <LOCATION> Transylvania </LOCATION> transfusion. In the movie, which debuts on Wednesday, she's hiding out from an amatory vampire named <PERSON> Vlad </PERSON>, played by <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Cross </PERSON>. `` She's trying to escape not only from <PERSON> Vlad </PERSON> but from being a vampire,'' said d'Abo. `` It's offbeat. Usually, vampires enjoy being vampires. She wants to get rid of it if she can.'' `` Nightlife'' is strictly fang in cheek. Although it's not as broad as `` Love at First Bite'' it's closer to that than to `` Dracula.'' <PERSON> Angelique </PERSON> lives in a condo with a maid so ditsy she does n't notice her boss sleeps in a coffin It opens with <PERSON> Angelique </PERSON> arising from a sleep of 100 years when her grave in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> is dug up. She collapses and is rushed to the nearest blood bank for a pick-me-up. The doctor in charge, played by <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Szarabajka </PERSON>, believes she is suffering from a rare blood disorder. They fall in love and <PERSON> Vlad </PERSON>'s wrath turns into a blood feud. The movie looks at how modern medicine would view a vampire, which would be as a disease. And how an ancient vampire would look at modern medicine, which would be with contempt. <PERSON> D'Abo </PERSON> took a week out from her leading role in the <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> miniseries `` Not a Penny More, Not a Penny Less'' to come here to promote the comedy thriller. In 1987 she co-starred in `` The Living Daylights'' with <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dalton </PERSON>, making his first film as <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON>. While in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, the British actress lives with her cousin, <PERSON> Olivia </PERSON> d'Abo of `` The Wonder Years.'' <PERSON> Maryam </PERSON> was last seen here as an alien from another planet in the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> miniseries `` Something Is Out There'' and its spinoff series of the same name. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Cortese </PERSON> also starred as an earthbound policeman. `` The problem was that the series just could n't find its style,'' she said. `` <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> and I were hoping it would follow the comedy style of the miniseries. But there's always a fear you're not entertaining the audience if you do n't have a lot of action. It's a way of playing it safe. I believe in stories first. I know now the hardest writing is series writing. There's no time.'' `` Not a Penny More'' is a two-part, four-hour miniseries based on the novel by <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Archer </PERSON>. A corrupt financier played by <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Asner </PERSON> swindles four innocent investors, who devise a scheme to recover their money. D'Abo plays <PERSON> Asner </PERSON>'s daughter, who disapproves of her father's financial dealings and is romantically involved with one of his victims. The filming will continue until October. D'Abo was born in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> father and a <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> mother. The name is Finnish; her father's ancestors reached <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> more than 600 years ago, quite probably in a Viking longboat. After her parents' divorce, she was brought up in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, where her first language was French. Her mother was the head of <ORGANIZATION> UNICEF </ORGANIZATION> greeting cards in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` I started acting in amateur high school productions,'' she said. `` I wanted to be an artist, however, and attended the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Printing </ORGANIZATION>. It was too technical and I switched to the Drama Centre in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. We called it the Trauma Centre.'' Soon after getting her union card, which enabled her to work professionally, she left the school. Her first role was in the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> miniseries `` Master of the Game.'' She played <PERSON> Dominique </PERSON>, an artists' model hired by <PERSON> Dyan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cannon </PERSON> to influence her son to give up his ambitions of becoming a painter <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamlin </PERSON> played Cannon's son. `` Hopefully in 20 years, when I can consider myself a respected actress, I'll go back to being an artist,'' she said. `` It's a very soothing hobby. In the meantime, I just do sketches and caricatures.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, now in its second year under an acting director, is struggling to cope with a shrinking investigtive staff and a tight budget as it tries to learn the causes of the nation's worst air, sea and ground accidents. Four congressmen say the situation is worsening and recently wrote President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, asking him to nominate a director as a first step in rebuilding morale and retaining the agency's reputation as a leading safety advocate. More pointedly, a top <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> official has complained that his investigative staff may dwindle so much by year's end that the agency will have to curtail by one-third the 3,000 or so accident investigtions it undertakes each year. `` The bureau's situation is critical and worsening,'' wrote the official, <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Banks </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION>'s field operations director. Criticism of the agency's actions _ or lack of them _ also comes from former employees, who charge that the acting chairman, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolstad </PERSON>, is afraid to make waves within the government or in the industries his agencies is supposed to watch over. <PERSON> Kolstad </PERSON> has been acting director since Aug. 14, 1988, after <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> failed to win senatorial approval for a fourth two-year term as chairman. <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON>, who had acquired a reputation as a strong, independent safety advocate, is widely believe to have angered Sen. <PERSON> Wendell </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, D-Ky. and the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> aviation subcommittee, with a speech blasting <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s proposal to separate the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> from the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON>'s renomination languished without the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> even holding a hearing into the matter. Since then, <PERSON> Kolstad </PERSON> has become the target of criticism that he has not dealt with morale problems, has not pushed for increases in the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 25.4 million budget, and has not stopped the outflow of investigators. Recently, four ranking members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> told <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> that he should nominate a chairman. `` We believe that continued uncertainty may have a detrimental effect on the activities of the board and its respected leadership role in transportation safety,'' said the letter. The congressmen said low morale `` could lead to the loss of valuable expertise and experience.'' It was signed by Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Roe </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, the committee's chairman; Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, the ranking Republican; Rep. <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Valentine </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION>, chairman of the panel's transportation subcommittee; and Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Fla </LOCATION>., the subcommittee's ranking For his part, <PERSON> Kolstad </PERSON> said in an interview that he believes morale is better than it was when he took over. But he added: `` There is a concern that we have people in an acting capacity, because it suggests that a lot of change that might otherwise occur ca n't occur. There is frustration among some staff people. It's in everyone's interest that the matter be resolved.'' <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON>'s supporters, speaking anonymously, maintain that while <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> may favor <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON>, a longtime political supporter and campaign activist for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, some White House advisers dislike <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON>'s outspokeness on safety issues. These sources maintain that there has been extensive industry lobbying to keep <PERSON> Kolstad </PERSON>, a former public relations vice president for <ORGANIZATION> Frontier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, as chairman. As for the future of the board's investigations, Banks, the field operations director, projected in a May 11 memo that six more investigators would quit by the end of the year, making the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> to unable to live up to its congressional mandate to investigate all airplane crashes. His memo, forecasting that the agency would have to cut the number of accidents it investigates a year by 900, never made it to the board. It was sent back by the board's staff director, <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, preventing the issue from being debated by the board and, perhaps, being aired at a public hearing. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, like <PERSON> Kolstad </PERSON>, disagreed with the severity of Banks' assessment and thought the situation not serious enough to be put before the board Banks declined to discuss the memo with a reporter. For his part, <PERSON> Kolstad </PERSON> discounted <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>'s concerns as `` overly pessimistic'' and said no major investigations or critical safety problems would be affected at the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION>, which examines airplane crashes, sea disasters, major highway accidents and pipeline breaks. `` There has been a cutback'' in investigations, <PERSON> Kolstad </PERSON> said. `` But, frankly, we've got fewer accidents; the accident rate is improving. That does n't suggest we have enough people to investigate the accidents that exist, because we do n't, but I think we're doing a better job on the ones that we are investigating.'' Major investigations now under way include two recent incidents involving explosive engine failures in DC-10s, other airliner accidents, oil spills in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and elsewhere, and several freight train derailments. Over the last decade, the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION>'s staff has been reduced from more than 400 to 324, with many key investigators leaving for higher-paying, private jobs. Some <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> staff members praise <PERSON> Kolstad </PERSON> as personable and competent. Private air safety consultant <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, once the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION>'s director of accident investigtions, describes the acting chairman as a `` fine individual'' who recognizes his limitations. Others once associated with the agency have a different opinion. `` <PERSON> Kolstad </PERSON> is a caretaker who does n't take care of the board,'' said former <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> public affairs director <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Furman </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Woodmere </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, lawyer who stays close to transportation safety issues and still visits accident sites as a media consultant. <PERSON> Furman </PERSON>, who left the board in 1987, when <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> was chairman, said <PERSON> Kolstad </PERSON> has failed to push hard within the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration for a bigger agency budget. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON>, who resigned from the agency's staff last week after being shifted from managing director of the staff to a job with considerably less responsibility, said <PERSON> Kolstad </PERSON> `` does n't want to rock the boat. While the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> has no regulatory power of its own, it is the government's primary accident investigation agency and makes recommendations to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, other agencies and transportation industries. <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kolstad </PERSON> have sharply different styles and are often at odds on safety issues. The former chairman is sometimes the only dissenter on the board; the acting chairman has been low key, rarely taking strong positions in open meetings. Critics of the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> cite several incidents as evidence of problems: _ The board failed to investigate the complaint this spring of 60 air traffic controllers in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> who signed a petition citing high-altitude `` air traffic chaos'' and calling for steps to alleviate the `` hazardous environment. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, the acting managing director, headed off the petition before it reached the board, contending it would be a bad precedent to investigate what might be a labor-management problem. _ <PERSON> Kolstad </PERSON> was the board member assigned to the <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valdez </ORGANIZATION> oil spill but did not go to <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> to head the investigation <PERSON> Kolstad </PERSON> answered that charge be saying that he has been very active in the inquiry and that he decided not to go because other high government officials were going and he did not see the need for `` sending another big name to the scene.'' _ While imposing a hiring freeze to meet its budget, the board held a meeting for top personnel in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and the acting chairman made two official trips to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> <PERSON> Kolstad </PERSON> said that the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> meeting provided important dialogue with industry representatives and that the board had gotten `` a good deal'' on hotel accommodations and other expenses. He said both European trips were worthwhile and part of his official duties.

 <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> was a rebel without a car. Hall longed for a stylish, affordable convertible that would recapture the sheer driving fun offered by British sports cars of the past. One, he says, with a `` soul.'' But <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> was n't making them anymore. Detroit would n't. It seemed unlikely that <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>'s bosses at <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION>, the Japanese automaker, would take a gamble on such a car. <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>'s dream machine, however, came true: the Mazda MX5 Miata. The two-seat ragtop with smooth-flowing lines is drawing raves from car critics and eager customers willing to pay thousands over its list price. `` I am not suprised that it has gone over very well. I am surprised by the intensity of the reaction,'' <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said. He explains its impact in emotional terms: `` It's a feeling car. It feels like it's doing everything correctly. It works on your soul, maybe because it has a soul.'' Hall, 36, <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION>'s product planning manager here, and assistant chief designer <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>, 35, have both been pulled over by police while taking early spins in the peppy Miata _ but only for reviews. `` How do you like the car?'' an officer shouted to <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> after drawing alongside. `` I've got one on order.'' Hall credits similar enthusiasm among his <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> colleagues in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> with helping to persuade company management to build the car. It was in the late 1970s, while <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> was working as a writer for an auto publication, that he first suggested to a <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> executive that the firm consider making an affordable sports car similar to a Triumph or an Austin-Healy. `` I was raised in these quality bits of British workmanship. My father owned a bunch of sports cars, and he would throw us in the back seat. I remember the wind blasting through my hair,'' said <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>. He was hired in 1981 at <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION>'s North American research and development facility in <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION>, 40 miles south of downtown <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, and started lobbying from within. `` Anytime anyone would come from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, I would get on the soapbox and talk to them about it,'' said <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> executives gradually came around, <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said. Backing the decision was research material compiled by colleague <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Kilbourne </PERSON> showing that an American and international market existed for a two-seater. Hall and <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> say they wanted to produce a car that combined British style and driving allure with Japanese reliability and value. But, they say, they knew there had to to be something more intangible. `` It's not just a car people are buying. They're buying a philosophy, a little emotional statement,'' <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said. `` The car has to be a kick-in-the-stomach car; a people-will-either-hate-it-or-love-it car. You do n't make anything that's really worthwhile if you make it so everybody likes it.'' <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said he thinks that's why the Miata, despite its instant appeal to Americans, did n't roll off an American assembly line. `` <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> is in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, and therein lies the problem,'' he said. He recalled a conversation in which the chairman of one of the big three automakers, whom he would n't identify, asked him, `` ` When are people in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> going to wise up and stop buying funny little cars?''' `` A lot of decisionmakers have the feeling that if the market is n't buying what they're making, the market is wrong,'' <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said. He and <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>, who both have relatives working as auto designers in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, say they know the idea has been proposed there, thus far without success. <PERSON> Toshiko </PERSON> <PERSON> Hirai </PERSON>, the Miata project manager in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, `` made sure the car got through with the purity that we had on paper. And that's so seldom how the auto industry works,'' <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> said The designers and engineers in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> even recorded and analyzed the sound of 200 sports car exhaust systems to get just the right pitch for the car, he said. All that fervor, <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> says, has produced a treat for drivers _ and for him. `` People appreciate it. That's my payback; seeing all the gents and the cute-looking girls out for a spin.''

<HEAD>Napalmed Vietnamese Girl Reunited With Her Pulitzer-Winning Photographer</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HAVANA, Cuba (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The napalmed Vietnamese girl in the Pulitzer Prize-winning picture that came to symbolize the atrocity of war is planning a trip to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> with a message of reconciliation and hope. <PERSON> Phan </PERSON> <PERSON> Thi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Phuc </PERSON> was a terrified 9-year-old running from her napalmed <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> village one June day in 1972 when <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> photographer <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Ut </PERSON> captured her moment of agony for the ages. The gripping picture appeared on newspaper front pages nationwide, enshrining <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> as a personification of Vietnamese suffering, and ravaging the American conscience. Unseen in the photograph were the ghastly burns. `` Her whole back and neck and arm were black like barbecue,'' Ut recalls. `` There was terrible heat. I was running, running, running away. I tore off my burning clothes. But the burning did n't stop. I was alone with that terrible heat,'' <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magazine </ORGANIZATION> writer <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Coburn </PERSON> on the eve of a scheduled six-week trip across <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Ut </ORGANIZATION> met again on July 24, their first meeting in 17 years, during a brief reunion in <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION>. `` To me, she's part of the family,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Ut </ORGANIZATION>, whose famous picture hangs in the den of his suburban <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> home. `` I tell my children <PERSON> Bettina </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, who were born in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, how lucky they are to escape war.'' Ut fled <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> in April 1975 and worked two years in the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> bureau before transferring to the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> office, where he continues to work as a staff photographer The <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> reunion was a shock for Ut. The wounded child he photographed and took to a hospital in 1972 had grown into a beautiful woman, the scars on her back, chest and arm concealed beneath a T-shirt. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> accepted a Vietnamese government invitation to go to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> in 1986, where she eventually began studies in pharmacology.

 Ending a controversial chapter in the government's insider trading probe, prosecutors have decided not to lodge charges against two Wall Street executives arrested in 1987 while a third agreed to a guilty plea. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Benito </PERSON> <PERSON> Romano </PERSON> made the announcement Thursday after a top trader at <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>, said he would plead guilty to mail fraud as part of an agreement with prosecutors. `` In hindsight, we would have been better advised not to proceed with the arrests at such an early stage of the investigation,'' <PERSON> Romano </PERSON> said. The charges initially were brought by then-U.S. Attorney <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> and frequently have been cited as an example of overzealous white-collar prosecution by <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>, now a candidate for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> mayor. <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> was arrested with <ORGANIZATION> Kidder </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> trader <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Wigton </PERSON> and ex-Kidder trader <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Tabor </PERSON> in February 1987, an indirect result of the <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> insider trading scandal that shook Wall Street three months earlier. <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wigton </PERSON> were seized in their offices as stunned colleagues watched. <PERSON> Wigton </PERSON> was led away in handcuffs. The government voluntarily dropped the initial charges against the trio in May 1987 after a judge rejected requests by prosecutors for more pretrial preparation time. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney's office indicated at the time that it planned another indictment, but new charges were not brought. <PERSON> Romano </PERSON> told a news conference Thursday the government had closed its investigation of <LOCATION> Wigton </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tabor </LOCATION> without bringing any charges. `` It's about time they did,'' said <PERSON> Wigton </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Arkin </PERSON>. `` They wrongly and unjustly arrested the man and charged him and left him in a state of uncertainty for two years. ... The government ought to apologize to him.'' A statement released by <PERSON> Tabor </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawler </PERSON>, called <PERSON> Tabor </PERSON>'s arrest `` a terrible misjudgment.'' `` That decision has caused Mr. <PERSON> Tabor </PERSON> incalculable personal and professional damage,'' he said. `` A thorough investigation would have established, and indeed has established, that Mr. <PERSON> Tabor </PERSON> is innocent of any wrongdoing.'' <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>, 47, who also resigned as head of <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION>' arbitrage operation, said he decided to plea to end the ordeal of a criminal investigation that began 2 -LCB- years ago `` Life has become a nightmare for me and my family,'' <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> told the firm in a letter. `` I have been unable to participate in the firm's activities in a meaningful way.'' At an appearance before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> Nina </PERSON> <PERSON> Gershon </PERSON>, <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> said he had agreed to plead guilty to one count of mail fraud in connection with trades involving the stock of <ORGANIZATION> Beatrice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Companies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in early January 1986. He is to formally enter his plea Sept. 5 before Judge <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Leval </PERSON>. The felony carries a maximum prison term of five years and prosecutors are seeking $ 1.86 million in fines. The plea agreement caps a criminal investigation of <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>'s activities with <PERSON> Kidder </PERSON> and several other investment firms <PERSON> Romano </PERSON> said <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> probably will face civil charges filed by the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Romano </PERSON> also said that under the plea agreement, <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> is not required to cooperate in the government's investigation of Wall Street corruption. He would not comment on whether prosecutors were seeking information from <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>. <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> was implicated by former <PERSON> Kidder </PERSON> takeover strategist <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON>, who had been fingered by <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> as using illegal insider information for stock trades. <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> said he only knew <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON> through business telephone conversations. `` I never talked with <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON> with the idea of influencing any trading decisions by him,'' he said in his letter. `` The conversation with him ... regarding <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON> certainly took place, and I should not have initiated trading after it,'' he said. As head of arbitrage, the speculative buying and selling of stock, <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> said he invested heavily in <LOCATION> Beatrice </LOCATION> stock _ for <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION> as well as his personal account _ based on his confidence that <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s debt-financed takeover of <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON> would succeed. The government accused <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> of trading stock on the basis of illegal insider information from <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON>, who represented <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> in the Beatrice deal. But <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> said his only involvement with <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON> was a phone conversation in which <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON> confirmed rumors that the deal faced difficulties.

<HEAD>Navistar Plans Layoffs, Hints at Fourth-Quarter Loss</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Truck-maker <ORGANIZATION> Navistar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> plans to lay off an undetermined number of workers due to slowing demand for its products and says it may end up posting a loss in its fourth quarter. The Chicago-based company, the nation's leading manufacturer of medium and heavy trucks, made the statements Thursday in announcing a 41 percent drop in third-quarter earnings. <ORGANIZATION> Navistar </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenhill </PERSON> said the company had not yet determined how many employees would be laid off. But he indicated the cutbacks would mainly affect the company's <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, truck-assembly plant, which employs 6,200 of <ORGANIZATION> Navistar </ORGANIZATION>'s 15,000 workers. `` The decision was just made in the last couple of days and we're still sorting out the manning requirements,'' <PERSON> Greenhill </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Navistar </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Cotting </PERSON> said in a statement that after an increase of 14 percent in the first half, industry-wide orders for heavy trucks declined by 33 percent in <ORGANIZATION> Navistar </ORGANIZATION>'s third fiscal quarter. Industry orders for medium trucks fell 12 percent in the first half and 18 percent in the third quarter. <PERSON> Greenhill </PERSON> said the dwindling demand reflected uncertainty among <ORGANIZATION> Navistar </ORGANIZATION> customers about the company's future. Truck purchases `` represent a major capital investment'' for large-scale buyers, he said. `` When there are questions about the economy, they just go into neutral or defer their purchasing plans,'' <PERSON> Greenhill </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Navistar </ORGANIZATION> said in response to the slower demand it suspended assembly operations Monday at its <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> plant for five days and at its <LOCATION> Chatham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>, plant in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> for 10 days. <ORGANIZATION> Navistar </ORGANIZATION> also said it had cut daily production of heavy trucks at <LOCATION> Chatham </LOCATION> from 54 to 49 on July 31, and that it would reduce the <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> plant's output of heavy and medium trucks by 15 percent, to 298 per day, beginning Sept. 18. At <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, one of the two assembly lines will return to one-shift operation while two shifts will be maintained on the other, <ORGANIZATION> Navistar </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Cotting </PERSON> said the reduced fourth-quarter production schedules would reduce fourth-quarter earnings below the third-quarter results and could even result in a small loss. <ORGANIZATION> Navistar </ORGANIZATION> reported net income of $ 28 million, or 8 cents a share, for the three months ended July 31, compared to $ 47 million, or 15 cents a share, in the same period a year ago. Sales for the third quarter totaled $ 1.03 billion, a 5 percent increase over $ 976 million for the comparable 1988 quarter. The company said the earnings decline reflected unusually high production costs caused by the company's decision to speed up assembly operations during the quarter to meet demand for some of its newer models.

 Billionaire developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> promised to make his air shuttle service a diamond when he bought it from <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, but he's settling for false pearls. Female flight attendants employed by Trump Shuttle are now required to wear `` faux'' pearl necklaces and earrings as part of their uniforms, provided by the airline. `` It's a very nice look,'' Trump Shuttle spokeswoman <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Fudala </PERSON> said Thursday. `` It does give a very professional look to the uniform.'' The single-strand necklaces are about 15 inches long, Ms. <PERSON> Fudala </PERSON> said. She noted that false pearls have been given new respectability by First Lady <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who has admitted to wearing them. The spokeswoman said she did n't know the cost of the pearls. Trump Shuttle, which links <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, employs 255 flight attendants, most of them women. Their uniforms are navy blue with burgundy stripes on the sleeves. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, who started operating the shuttle on June 8, shortly after a federal bankruptcy judge approved the $ 365 million purchase from strikebound Eastern, has pledged to spend as much as $ 2 million on each plane for refurbishing, safety checks and repainting. `` I want the shuttle to be a diamond,'' he has said. The interiors of <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s 21 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727s will be redone in burgundy and saddle-brown tones with chrome and maple wood veneer accents. Like the pearls, the pink marble vanities in the new lavatories will be imitation. Although flight attendants often wear their own jewelry, it is not considered a mandatory part of the uniform in the airline business, said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Steffen </PERSON>, a flight attendant for <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. Since most shuttle passengers are more concerned about arriving on time than fancy amenities, however, the flight attendants might be casting pearls before swine.

 Steel imports rose in June for the third consecutive month but are running sharply below 1988 for the first half of the year, according to the American Iron and <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> steel exports in June continued to run substantially ahead of recent years. June exports totaled 403,000 tons, compared with 355,000 tons in May and 126,000 tons in June 1988. For the first half, exports totaled 2.2 million tons, compared with 670,000 tons in the first six months of 1988, the <ORGANIZATION> AISI </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. First-half imports totaled 8.7 million tons, down 21 percent from 11.03 million tons in the 1988 period. The shipments during the first half of this year represented 17.3 percent, down from 20.8 percent a year earlier. In June, imports fell by 5.2 percent to 1.55 million tons. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> imported 1.47 tons of steel in May, 1.34 million tons in April and 1.22 million tons in March, the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, producers' group said based on its interpretation of <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reports. The June imports represented 18.3 percent of the domestic market, May 17.2 percent, April 16.5 percent and March 14.4 percent. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on July 18 granted a 30-month extension to quotas that were due to expire Sept. 30. The quotas are designed to limit imports to 18.5 percent of the domestic market. The <ORGANIZATION> AISI </ORGANIZATION> said the rise in imports coincides with a weakening of the world market for steel and confirms the industry's contention that other countries increase their exports to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> when business elsewhere softens. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Imported </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, said that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> producers imported 1.1 million tons of semi-finished steel in the first half. `` Without imported steel slab, domestic steel producers would be unable to meet demand. Imports of finished steel products also benefit <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> users and distributors by relieving shortages and cutting costs,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>, president of the importers' association and president of the <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> importer <ORGANIZATION> Maurice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pincoffs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>

 The <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> has subpoenaed several top officials and former employees of <ORGANIZATION> Egghead </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> as part of an investigation of allegations of securities fraud. <ORGANIZATION> Egghead </ORGANIZATION>, which owns <ORGANIZATION> Egghead </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Discount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Software </ORGANIZATION>, one of the nation's largest personal computer software chains, said Thursday the investigation apparently was triggered by a class-action lawsuit filed July 18 in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> by shareholders. The suit came after <ORGANIZATION> Egghead </ORGANIZATION> reported nearly $ 13 million in unexpected losses last quarter, despite a 50 percent increase in quarterly sales. <ORGANIZATION> Egghead </ORGANIZATION> blamed part of its problems on poor computerized accounting systems. It said that as it doubled the number of its stores in a year, it lost millions of dollars in inventory to `` shrinkage'' _ theft or other unexplained reasons. `` The focus of the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> inquiry appears to be on certain facts alleged by the plaintiff in the class-action litigation filed last month,'' said <PERSON> Matt </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Egghead </ORGANIZATION>'s executive vice president in charge of finance and administration. <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Egghead </ORGANIZATION> is cooperating with <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> investigators. <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Egghead </ORGANIZATION> has been told by <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> staff that the inquiry should not be construed as an indication that any law has been violated. `` It is our understanding that the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> routinely investigates matters like these,'' he said. In the suit, shareholder <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON> alleged he and other shareholders were damaged as a result of misstatements in connection with the company's initial public offering and statements during the period from June 6, 1988, through April 24, 1989, and later public filings. <ORGANIZATION> Egghead </ORGANIZATION> and its directors are accused in the suit of failing to disclose material facts about the company's inventory systems and finances at the time <ORGANIZATION> Egghead </ORGANIZATION>'s stock went public in June 1988. <ORGANIZATION> Egghead </ORGANIZATION> says the lawsuit is without merit. <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> confirmed that <ORGANIZATION> Egghead </ORGANIZATION> founder and chairman <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Alhadeff </PERSON> was among the officers subpoenaed by the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday that it had learned at least two former employees had been subpoenaed and had hired lawyers to represent them. <ORGANIZATION> Egghead </ORGANIZATION> reported a loss of $ 12.1 million or 80 cents a share for fiscal 1989, on sales of $ 342.4 million.

 The president and chief operating officer of <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> has announced his resignation just 18 months after joining the thrift. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fish </PERSON>, who said Thursday he was resigning effective Sept. 30, comes as <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> tries to devise a new financial strategy after <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> barred savings and loans from holding junk bonds as part of the multibillion thrift bailout. Fish was credited with helping <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> decentralize operations, with senior managers assuming more responsibility.

 When <PERSON> Generoso </PERSON> <PERSON> Pope </PERSON> ruled the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enquirer </ORGANIZATION>, executives often proposed taking the often outrageous tabloid beyond American supermarket checkout lines. The plans always were rejected by a man who often diverted his energies to elaborate Christmas decorations and meticulous landscaping around the publication's headquarters here. But the new owners of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enquirer </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Weekly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> tabloids say they see no obstacles for expansion plans that include Spanish-language and international editions. Although no formal deals have been made for foreign editions, talks are continuing with several British publishers, including <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>, who unsuccessfully tried to acquire the Enquirer's publisher, <ORGANIZATION> GP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, following <PERSON> Pope </PERSON>'s death in October `` We are looking at a number of possibilities to publish outside the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and Mr. <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> is just one of those we have spoken with,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Boylan </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Macfadden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Macfadden </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ventures </ORGANIZATION>, a media-oriented investment firm, paid $ 412.5 million for GP Group in April The National Enquirer, which <PERSON> Pope </PERSON> purchased from <ORGANIZATION> Hearst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in 1952 for $ 75,000, is the nation's leading tabloid with weekly circulation of about 4.3 million. The more sensational Weekly World News sells about 1.3 million. <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> <PERSON> Magazines </PERSON>' runner-up Star sells about 3.6 million copies weekly, and <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> reports a total weekly circulation of about 3.2 million from its Sun, <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> and National Examiner papers. <PERSON> Macfadden </PERSON> owns several romance and teen monthly publications, the largest of which is True Story, with circulation of 1.3 million. <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ventures </ORGANIZATION> last year acquired <ORGANIZATION> Motown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION> in a venture with <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Macfadden </PERSON> is in early stages of planning a Spanish-language edition targeted for the large Hispanic populations in such cities as <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Boylan </PERSON> `` We want it to be basically the same paper, but we'll tailor it to include people and celebrities the Hispanic community knows and follows,'' said <PERSON> Boylan </PERSON>, who would not predict a date for the new edition. <PERSON> Boylan </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION> likely would be the beachhead for the overseas expansion, which could begin by early next year. He said other countries, such as <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, also were being studied. He described <PERSON> Macfadden </PERSON>'s proposed foreign tabloids as a combination of the stories from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> editions and other articles of local or international interest. While New York-based <PERSON> Macfadden </PERSON> has n't tampered with <PERSON> Pope </PERSON>'s editorial formula _ although some other eccentricities have been dropped such as a $ 1 million Christmas tree and keeping the company grass four inches high _ analysts have predicted that cost-cutting measures will be needed to cover the high acquisition price In June, <PERSON> Macfadden </PERSON> announced the layoffs of 20 workers from editorial, advertising and other departments. An additional 37 jobs were trimmed last month when the News printing operation was transferred from <LOCATION> Pompano </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. The price of the Enqurier was raised from 75 cents to 85 cents following the purchase and the Weekly World News rose a nickle to 70 cents. Last year, the Enquirer and News reportedly earned $ 15 million on revenue of about $ 150 million. <PERSON> Boylan </PERSON> also said <PERSON> Macfadden </PERSON> remained interested in launching a soap opera publication but had not yet decided on a format or when such a publication could appear. <PERSON> Boylan </PERSON> said distribution of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> projects could be handled by the company's <ORGANIZATION> DSI </ORGANIZATION> unit, which has nearly 600 full - and part-time workers managing rack space at about 19,000 supermarkets and retailers

<HEAD>Dollar Gains Against Yen, Nikkei Declines</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Improved <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade figures helped push the dollar higher against the yen today, while stock prices declined, traders said. The dollar opened at 143.50 yen, up 1.18 yen from Thursday's close It finished trading at 143.52 yen after ranging between 143.05 and 143.58 yen. Traders said the dollar's higher opening was due to better-than-expected <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade figures released Thursday, which triggered dollar buying in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit in June fell to $ 8.2 billion, down 18.9 percent from the previous month's $ 10.1 billion. But the dollar gradually moved downward from the opening because `` market players were selling the dollar for profit taking,'' said a trader with the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity. By the end of the day, however, the dollar had returned to its opening level. `` There was no real reason to sell -LRB- dollars -RRB-,'' said <PERSON> Sumio </PERSON> <PERSON> Fukushima </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Sumitomo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. He said the dollar appeared to be in a `` box,'' with dealers unwilling to let it escape from a narrow range. On the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the 225-issue <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION> shed 26.97 points, or 0.08 percent, closing at 35,063.14. It had gained a marginal 5.96 points Thursday. Trading focused on high-priced issues, such as <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> TDK </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Victor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Haruhito </PERSON> <PERSON> Ichimura </PERSON>, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kangyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kakumaru </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>. Electricals and precision instrument issues attracted strong buyer interest, he said. `` The decline of the yen -LRB- on the exchange market -RRB- has been a plus for export issues,'' <PERSON> Ichimura </PERSON> said. Trading was thin, with only 450 million shares changing hands on the first section, unchanged from Thursday. <PERSON> Ichimura </PERSON> said the market was likely to return to its usual volume on Monday when market participants who have been on vacation return to work.

 A new minivan and a sport-utility vehicle will begin appearing next year in what some may think are unlikely places _ Oldsmobile dealerships. It will be the first time that Oldsmobile dealers have marketed trucks in the history of the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> division. Oldsmobile cars traditionally have been sold to middle-age, well-established consumers. Minivans and sport vehicles are aimed at a younger market. Oldsmobile officials have been trying to change the division's long-standing image, mainly through its Cutlass line of cars and an advertising campaign featuring the slogan `` This is not your father's Oldsmobile. A four-door, sport-utility vehicle will be made at <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Moraine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, plant, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Truck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Bus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> said Thursday. `` Oldsmobile will sell a version of the new vehicle that is going to be introduced as a 1990 model next summer,'' she said, adding she did n't know what the vehicle would be named. The <LOCATION> Moraine </LOCATION> plant now makes Chevrolet S-10 and GMC S-15 pickup trucks. Previously, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> announced that Oldsmobile dealers would sell versions of its new minivan, called the Silhouette, next year. That vehicle, being made now in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tarrytown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, along with <PERSON> Chevrolet </PERSON> <PERSON> Lumina </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Pontiac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sport </ORGANIZATION> minivans, will go on sale later this year. <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> <PERSON> Vaughan </PERSON>, vice president and group executive for the <ORGANIZATION> Truck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Bus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, said in a recent interview with the <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Pontiac </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Oldsmobile </PERSON> will get a top-of-the-line version of the four-door sport-utility vehicle.

Analyst <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Heaney </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> said she was concerned with `` badge engineering,'' or making minor, if any, changes in a car and putting a different nameplate on it `` They are doing the same thing with the minivan,'' she said. `` It's going right back to what they used to do _ making everything look alike.'' However, <PERSON> Heaney </PERSON> said the decision to put a sport-utility vehicle in Oldsmobile dealerships may be a good one. `` It moves the Olds image a little bit upscale and the Jeep products are expensive,'' she said. `` Those are upscale buyers, maybe that's <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s strategy.''

 The stock market was mostly lower in early trading, pressured by new economic data that suggested inflation might not be easing. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 1.33 points to 2,678.30 at 10 a.m. EDT, 30 minutes after the opening bell. Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 6 to 5 on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with 486 issues down, 396 up and 558 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 19.60 million shares. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announced today that consumer inflation rose a modest 0.2 percent in July, held down by the sharpest drop in gasoline prices in nearly three years. The number was in line with expectations, analysts said. But many investors were focusing on the 0.4 percent rise in the index excluding food and energy, the most volatile components. `` The CPI report, while it looks good on the headline, when you read further in there is concern that we have seen the lows in inflation and will be moving higher in the months ahead,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Solloway </PERSON>, economist with <ORGANIZATION> Argus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Solloway </PERSON> said the market's weakness reflected some disappointment that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> is not going to ease credit conditions in the near future Prices for the first seven months of 1989 rose at a 5.5 percent annual rate, more than a full percentage point higher than the 4.4 percent increases in both 1988 and 1987, the government said. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks was up 0.04 to 191.99. At the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the market value index was off 0.15 to 378.19. On Thursday, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 13.66 points to finish at 2,679.63, after trading down about 25 points during the session.

 <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Badtke </PERSON>'s new farm implement wo n't milk <PERSON> Elsie </PERSON> or plow the back 40, but it can identify his most productive cows and calculate the best time to water the crops <PERSON> Badtke </PERSON> is one of a growing number of farmers nationwide who have added a personal computer to their collection of tools to make a living off the land. Farmers are using computers to help plan their finances, manage their herds and tell them when to irrigate. Despite the time it takes to learn how to use a computer, they say the technology can make their operations more efficient and let them reap more profits in the uncertain world of modern-day agriculture. <PERSON> Badtke </PERSON> said he plans to use his computer to rank his cows, so he knows which are the most efficient. `` By culling cows at the right time we could be saving on feed,'' he said, noting that he spends about $ 60,000 a year on cattle feed. `` That's what you're after, to gain more of an edge.'' `` Farming is definitely a business. It was a business 10 years ago, but the margins have been narrowed and the costs of being wrong are so high that you ca n't afford to be wrong too often,'' said <PERSON> Arlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Brannstrom </PERSON>, assistant director of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION>, a resource for agricultural software. `` I'm sure a lot of farms were lost because they did n't have enough information,'' he said. The farm computer business started to sprout around the beginning of the decade, at the same time the agricultural economy was sliding into a recession. `` In the 70s, there was tremendous expansion in agriculture. It gave a lot of prosperity to a lot of people,'' said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Randolph </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Harvest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION>, a farm software company in <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind </LOCATION>. `` In the 80s, things tightened up.'' `` It just happened that this technology came around in the 80s,'' he said. `` It was fortuitous _ the economy created a need and the technology filled that need.'' Estimates vary on the number of farmers using computers. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Brunz </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Companies </ORGANIZATION>, said numbers range from 8 percent to 20 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> says 15 percent of farm operators in 1988 with gross sales of $ 250,000 or more were using computers for record keeping. The department says farmers in that category accounted for more than half of all farm sales. The <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> lists about 1,900 titles of different agricultural software, some developed by private companies and others by universities. `` There's been a very rapid growth,'' <PERSON> Brannstrom </PERSON> said. `` Obviously 10 years ago there was almost nothing on the shelf.'' The computer programs range from basic accounting to helping farmers tend their crops. For example, researchers at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> this year introduced a computer program that tells potato farmers the best times to apply pesticides and irrigate. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>, who supervised the project, said the program combines principles of horticulture, entomology, plant pathology and agronomy, but all a farmer needs to know is simple data, such as temperatures and humidity. Without such assistance, <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> said, a farmer would be `` flying in the dark.'' `` He might use irrigation when the soil already has water,'' he said. `` He might spray when he does n't have to apply as much pesticide.'' The program costs about $ 245, but as <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> said, `` it could pay for itself with one application of pesticide, or one misapplication.'' The computer program this year saved about $ 250,000 for the R.D. <ORGANIZATION> Offutt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> Fargo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.D. </LOCATION>, which owns several potato farms, said <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Steevens </PERSON>, an agronomist for the company. <PERSON> Steevens </PERSON> said information from the program allowed operators to wait longer before spraying fungicides. `` Before, it was just a best guess, based on previous experience,'' he said. Farmers also use home computers to tap databases that provide up-to-the-minute information on the weather, commodity markets and world events that can shape the agriculture economy. A company that sells such a service is <ORGANIZATION> AgriData </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, in <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>, which started in 1981. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Markham </PERSON>, president of the company, said until recently, farmers focused on ways to expand production, `` but there's been very little emphasis on marketing the product and running the farm as a business.'' One of AgriData's customers is <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Vogts </PERSON>, a farmer in <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, who grows corn and peas. <PERSON> Vogts </PERSON> said while the information is useful in planning, `` you've still got to make the decision when to buy and sell. On one occasion, <PERSON> Vogts </PERSON> said, he was waiting for corn prices to reach a recommended target before selling. The price came close to the target, but then dropped quickly, and <PERSON> Vogts </PERSON> said in retrospect, he should not have followed the recommendations so strictly. But <PERSON> Vogts </PERSON> and others say computer equipment is well worth the investment, especially in relation to other farm machinery that can cost more than $ 100,000. `` A computer investment does n't compare,'' said <PERSON> Norlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hein </PERSON>, a professor of agricultural economics at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Missouri </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's about the same price as a used pickup truck, and not a very good used pickup.''

Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> today quoted sources familiar with <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> as saying <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> investor <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bass </PERSON> and a team formed by <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> had expressed interest in bidding for the nation's second-largest airline. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> declined to confirm the report. `` We have said the company has been contacted by various third parties but we have not identified any of them,'' spokesman <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> board met Thursday to review <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' offer and released a short statement late in the evening saying it was still premature to make any decision on whether to sell the company.

Ms. <PERSON> Dornacker </PERSON> also would not identify other potential buyers who have surfaced. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> responded to the meeting with a statement saying he and his associates were awaiting `` with interest the board's conclusions and continue to look forward to working with <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>'s board, management and labor groups to develop a transaction that works to the benefit of all parties concerned.'' On Wednesday, <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> raised his original $ 5.4 billion, or $ 240 a share, bid to $ 6.2 billion. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> also said his offer could go higher after a review of the company's financial data. In its statement Thursday, the board said that `` all possible financial and strategic alternatives should continue to be pursued.'' The company's stock, which climbed a dizzying $ 90 per share in less than two weeks in anticipation of a bidding war for <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>, was up $ 3.87 -LCB- to $ 270.25 a share in early <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading today. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> has filed documents in preparation for a possible proxy fight to unseat the <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> board and replace it with directors more sympathetic to his bid. There has been speculation in recent days that <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>, in conjunction with other <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> executives, may be planning a bid for the company himself or a recapitalization of the firm. There also has been talk that the leveraged buyout firms <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Forstmann </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Little </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> have contacted <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> about a possible deal.

The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> unit of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, with 7,125 members, made a bid for the company in 1987.

 Stock prices were lower in early trading, after new economic data that suggested inflationary pressures might not be cooling. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 0.95 point to 2,678.68 at 11 a.m. EDT. The blue-chip indicator was down 1.33 points an hour earlier. Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 4 to 3 on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with 636 issues down, 481 up and 596 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 44.95 million shares. Stock prices responded to weakness in the bond market after a <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report today that showed consumer inflation rose 0.2 percent in July. The increase in the Consumer Price Index matched the gain in June and showed the mildest two-month inflation picture since July-August 1986. While the number was in line with expectations, many investors focused on the 0.4 percent rise in the index excluding food and energy, the most volatile components, analysts said. `` The CPI report, while it looks good on the headline, when you read further in there is concern that we have seen the lows in inflation and will be moving higher in the months ahead,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Solloway </PERSON>, economist with <ORGANIZATION> Argus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Solloway </PERSON> said the market's weakness reflected some disappointment that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> is not going to ease credit conditions in the near future The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks was down 0.01 to 191.94.

<HEAD>Grain Futures Gain On Export News, Crop Estimate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Grain and soybean futures prices were mostly higher in early trading today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, bolstered by new export business and a private firm's surprisingly low crop estimates. The early gains were limited, however, by forecasts for rain in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> this weekend and next week. `` All the news, with the exception of weather, is bullish,'' said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON>, a trader with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Among the positive fundamentals were new crop estimates from Memphis-based <ORGANIZATION> Sparks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commodities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a private analytical firm, that were lower than the government projections issued last week. Sparks pegged the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION> soybean crop at 1.84 billion bushels, compared to the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s estimate of 1.91 billion, and <PERSON> Sparks </PERSON> pegged the corn crop at 7.05 billion bushels compared to the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s projected 7.35 billion. Buying of corn and wheat futures was also stimulated by news that <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> had purchased more than 400,000 metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn and that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> bought 150,000 metric tons of corn and 100,000 metric tons of wheat. The sales of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> were the first in two years and could portend more business down the road. In early trading, wheat was unchanged to 1 cent higher with the contract for delivery in September at $ 3.97 -LCB- a bushel; corn was 1 cent to 2 -RCB- cents higher with September at $ 2.38 a bushel; oats were 1 -LCB- cents to 1 -RCB- cents higher with September at $ 1.38 -RCB- a bushel; soybeans were 3 -LCB- cents to 9 cents higher with August at $ 6.17 a bushel. Cattle futures were mostly lower while pork futures were mixed in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Today is the last trading day for the August live cattle and hog contracts. Live cattle were .15 cent lower to .05 cent higher with August at 73.80 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .08 cent lower to .05 cent higher with August at 84.57 cents a pound; live hogs were .12 cent lower to .65 cent higher with August at 48.50 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .37 cent lower to .40 cent higher with August at 27 cents a pound. Livestock and meat futures settled mixed on Thursday.

<TEXT>
 Consumer inflation rose a modest 0.2 percent in July, held down by the sharpest drop in gasoline prices in nearly three years, the government said today. The increase in the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Consumer Price Index last month matched the gain in June. Together, the two reprts showed the mildest two-month inflation picture since July-August 1986 and marked a sharp contrast to surging prices in the first five months of the year. Even with the recent slowdown, prices for the first seven months of 1989 rose at a 5.5 percent annual rate, more than a full percentage point higher than the 4.4 percent increases in both 1988 and 1987. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the most recent dampening of cost pressures reflected drops in prices of gasoline and apparel, particularly women's clothing, and a moderate rise in food costs. `` It's more good news,'' said economist <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaber </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> consulting firm. `` The overall trend has been that the economy is, in fact, achieving the soft landing everyone was hoping for. In other words, growth is continuing but inflation is under control.'' In a separate report, the department said the moderation in inflation produced a 1.5 percent jump in Americans' average real earnings, to $ 338.01 a week. It was the largest advance since February 1982 and followed a slight 0.1 percent gain in June. In reaction to the inflation news, the stock market dipped slightly in early trading today. Analysts said traders believed the price moderation was not dramatic enough to spur the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> into loosening credit anytime soon. However, in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` We believe inflation is on a downward trend -LRB- and -RRB- ... lower inflation should take the pressure off interest rates.'' The administration has been pressuring the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> not to choke off economic growth, which would sharply reduce tax revenue and inflate the budget deficit. Gasoline prices, after shooting up 21.2 percent in the first five months of the year, fell 1.0 percent in June and dropped an additional 2.2 percent in July, the sharpest decline since October 1986. However, fuel oil costs rose 1.5 percent last month, reversing June's decline of 1.2 percent, and natural gas was up 0.5 percent. Food and beverage costs rose a moderate 0.3 percent in July following a 0.2 percent June gain. That was a moderation from the first five months of the year, when the lingering effects of last year's drought sent food prices up at a 9.3 percent annual rate. Cereal products, beverages and sweets all rose substantially, but they were offset by a 0.7 percent drop in the index for meats, poultry, fish and eggs. Clothing costs were down 0.8 percent last month, following a 1.1 percent decline in June. Prices for women's and girls' apparel fell 2.0 percent and those for infants and toddlers dropped 4.8 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> attributed the declines to larger-than-usual end-of-the-season price discounts for women's clothing. The price of goods and services other than food and energy rose 0.4 percent, driven up by a 2.0 percent gain for tobacco but dampened by a 0.4 percent decline for new cars. The various changes in July left the overall Consumer Price Index at 124.4 percent of its 1982-84 base. That means a hypothetical selection of goods costing $ 100 during the base period would have cost $ 124.40 in July, up 30 cents from June. The moderation in consumer prices had been expected by economists and was sure to be greeted as good news at the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which had been raising interest rates in order to slow the economy and cool inflationary pressures. In June, the central bank reversed course and began pushing interest rates down after spotting widespread evidence that the economy had softened. The recent good news on inflation is likely to confirm analysts' belief that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to shift policy was warranted. Although inflation in the first six months of the year was the worst first-half performance since 1982, economists generally expect the moderating trend of the last two months to continue. Economist <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ratajczak </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, who conducts his own independent price surveys, said, `` Our preliminary projections suggest that inflation may remain subdued in August ... -LRB- and -RRB- that when energy prices stabilize in the fall, consumer prices will return to a 4 percent path.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, according to a report to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> by Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> last month, is a bit less optimistic than private analysts, although it agrees that price increases will moderate in the second half. It is anticipating an inflation rate of between 5 percent and 5.5 percent for 1989. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, in a forecast released last month, predicted an inflation rate of 5 percent for all of 1989 _ implying an annual rate of about 4 percent from July through December _ and a 1990 rate of 4.1 percent. That was only slightly brighter than the consensus of 50 private economists compiled by <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indicators </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sedona </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz </LOCATION>. It forecast a 5.1 percent increase in costs this year, followed by a 4.6 percent rise in 1990.

 <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> claims it's doing so well rebuilding from a crippling strike that it will be bigger than expected, and the carrier may decide not to sell its prized South American routes. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, the chief bidder for <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s usually profitable Latin routes, expressed frustration at the lack of progress in negotiations on the sale, The <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> reported in today's editions. `` We're discouraged -LRB- because -RRB- the talks are so intermittent that it's hard to define the status,'' said American spokesman <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>. `` The frustration factor is very real _ it's really not clear that they want to sell.'' Eastern President <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakes </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> the carrier will be selling fewer assets than anticipated when it first began trying to come back from the strike and Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization. Bakes would n't go into details on the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> route negotiations and said he did n't `` want to set odds'' on whether they would be sold. `` We have made no final decision to sell <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. We have been in negotiations ... We do n't have an agreement and our board has not made a decision to sell <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' Bakes said. `` We will have more employees, it will service more cities and we'll have more airplanes,'' Bakes said in an interview. A pilots union spokesman Thursday expressed doubt about Bakes' projections and said Eastern is raising safety concerns by rushing its rebuilding efforts But <PERSON> Bakes </PERSON> said management is pleased about <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s progress since it announced plans to emerge at two-thirds its pre-strike size from Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization. The walkout by the airline's three unions began March 4. `` What we announced last April was the impossible, and there were a lot of skeptics, to say the least,'' Bakes said in the interview Wednesday. `` The fact is, we're exceeding targets -LRB- and -RRB- we will accelerate the schedule a little bit.'' Bakes detailed the revised, increased plans: _ Instead of 17,000 employees planned, there will be `` 18,000-plus, maybe more. _ Instead of 1,700 pilots planned, there will be more `` in the next year or two, maybe in the next few months in small groups. _ Instead of 157 aircraft, Eastern next year will fly 165 to 180 planes and also has the first nine of 40 new <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> aircraft on order available for 1992 _ Instead of 800 daily flights serving 77 cities, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> will probably add cities and flights, but no figures have been decided upon _ Instead of $ 1.8 billion in assets sales, the figure may be as low as $ 1.5 billion Fewer assets may be sold because transactions such as aircraft sales, <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> gates and the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> shuttle sale have earned more money than expected and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> is winning back customers at faster rates than expected. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s pilots union, noted reports that <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> is falling hundreds of millions of dollars behind on revenue. `` I do n't see how he can sit there with a straight face and say they're doing better than anticipated,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which represents pilots at nearly every major carrier, is considering a nationwide suspension of service to show support for Eastern's strikers. The union's executive council is in a two-day meeting Cole claimed Eastern flights experienced at least two unsafe landings in recent days because of inexperienced pilots. Eastern spokesman <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said the company had anticipated financial losses throughout this year and that losses have been less than expected. <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said the unions continue to try to use safety allegations as a weapon against the company. Union leaders said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> also is having trouble keeping up with maintenance of its aircraft because it lacks mechanics and spare parts. Bakes said 750 to 800 union pilots have crossed picket lines, but later clarified that about 100 of those are pilots who signed preferential recall lists after <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> stopped taking union pilots back. He said it has graduated 300 new pilots and has 700 in training. <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> contends any union pilot must get job preference over a pilot still in training, but <PERSON> Bakes </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> is committed to protecting the pilots in training.

 <ORGANIZATION> Isosceles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, which last month beat rival bidder <ORGANIZATION> Newgateway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> for majority control of British supermarket operator <ORGANIZATION> Gateway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, said Friday it has reached a truce with its rival, which still has a 40-percent holding in Gateway Under the truce, Newgateway, which comprises <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> financiers <PERSON> Wasserstein </PERSON> <PERSON> Perella </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, will exchange its holding for a proportionate stake in <LOCATION> Isoceles </LOCATION>. It will have representation on Gateway's board of directors, and will support Isosceles in implementing `` its commercial strategy.'' Newgateway is forbidden to increase its holding above 49.8 percent, unless Isosceles' board backs such a move. Newgateway lifted its stake in Gateway to the 40-percent level after losing the takeover contest last month. This holding represented a potential block to Isosceles' reorganization plans for Gateway. Isosceles, made up of a group of disgruntled Gateway shareholders, won the contest with a bid valuing Gateway at between 2.05 billion pounds, or $ 3.2 billion, and 2.23 billion pounds, or $ 3.5 billion.

<TEXT>
 It does n't take much to shatter deeply held convictions on Wall Street. Just when investors become convinced of one scenario, the economic winds shift, so-called in-depth analyses are blown away and it's time to change strategies. Investors recently got comfortable with the notion that the economy was sliding into a possibly severe recession and adjusted their portfolios accordingly, accumulating so-called ` defensive' issues such as food, tobacco and soaps The new thought is that the economy is stronger than expected, as suggested by the latest government statistics on everything from retail sales and homebuilding to trade and industrial production. Stock strategists are now talking of a revival in cyclical stocks, those that rise and fall with changes in the economy. Autos, chemicals, steel, metals and paper, which fit into this category, had been depressed lately compared to the rest of the market. Some strategists say the market began to show it was shifting gears about two weeks ago with the emergence of <ORGANIZATION> Phelps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dodge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the largest domestic producer of copper at about the time the July employment report was released. Other cyclicals have since followed. `` The psychology is that the turndown is getting near the bottom,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON>, senior vice president for <ORGANIZATION> Donaldson </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lufkin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Jenrette </PERSON>. `` If people can justify going out and buying <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> then they think things are OK.'' The July employment report showed joblessness down a notch to 5.2 percent and job growth stronger than expected June job growth also was revised upward. That was followed by unexpectedly strong July retail sales last week. But the real kicker in the retail sales report were the revisions to May and June figures, which suggested that three months back consumers were actually buying more than many investors had realized. That made an imminent consumer-led recession almost impossible, stock strategists concluded. Overnight, those who days earlier warned of recession this year softened their predictions. Subsequent reports on homebuilding, industrial production and trade led economists to conclude that the economy is in a modest expansion. `` A market that responds to ancient history as this market has done is lacking in long-term conviction,'' said <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON>, vice president at going.'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> McCabe </PERSON>, manager of market analysis at <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, says people have lost sight of what the numbers mean. `` I wonder why people seem to hang their hats on one number when experience shows that's going to change,'' he said. The numbers rekindled fears in some sectors of a renewed inflationary surge. Investors have scurried to shift their portfolios around and change investment strategies. Economist <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Yardeni </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, says the excessive mood swings and volatility are the result of shortsightedness brought on by the October 1987 stock market crash. `` The crash unnerved a lot of investors,'' <PERSON> Yardeni </PERSON> said. `` They thought recession and depression but the economy fooled them and continued to grow at a very solid pace. So investors lost confidence and the ability to get a handle on the economy.'' The mood swings have been more volatile than the underlying economy, <PERSON> Yardeni </PERSON> is quick to add. <PERSON> Yardeni </PERSON> says despite the market swings he has remained bullish throughout the year in recommending `` rustbowl'' stocks such as chemicals, aluminum and steel. But there is plenty of uncertainty left and the market is n't totally convinced yet that defensive stocks are passe For the time being, many analysts believe, the `` hold some, fold some'' strategy is the safest.

 The stock market remained mixed in moderate trading after firming slightly around midday as bonds recovered from earlier lows. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 2.46 points to 2,682.09 at 2 p.m. EDT. The blue-chip indicator was up 4.55 points at noon. Declining issues narrowly outnumbered advances by about 9 to 8 on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with 723 issues down, 630 up and 562 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 94.05 million shares. Traders said the market was choppy but remained generally trendless. Stock prices fell early in response to a weakening bond market after a <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report that showed consumer inflation rose 0.2 percent in July. While the number was in line with expectations, investors focused on the 0.4 percent rise in the index excluding food and energy, the most volatile components, analysts said. The data was interpreted as another indication that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> was unlikely to lower interest rates.

<HEAD>Warner, Chris-Craft Take Step Toward Settling Dispute</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chris-Craft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> took a big step Friday toward disentangling their corporate ties, announcing settlement of several legal disputes that have blocked the separation. The relationship was forged several years ago when <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>, the entertainment giant, recruited Chris-Craft to help it fend off unwanted takeover overtures. Chris-Craft became <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>'s largest shareholder, controlling an 18 percent interest in <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> through its majority-owned subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION> BHC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, while <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> bought a 42.5 percent stake in <ORGANIZATION> BHC </ORGANIZATION>. But <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> indicated this spring it wanted to sever those ties after it agreed to merge with, and later to be acquired by, media giant <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> dropped its right to match any offer Chris-Craft may get for its stake in <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> and gave Chris-Craft a choice of options on what it wanted done with <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>'s stake in <ORGANIZATION> BHC </ORGANIZATION> They have been in court in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> trying to resolve several issues resulting from the <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> deal with <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> and Friday's announcement described the settlement of some of those legal disputes The Time offer for <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> called for a payment of $ 70 a share in cash for half of <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>'s outstanding stock followed by an exchange of each remaining <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> share for a package of a still undetermined mix of cash and securities valued at $ 70. Under Friday's settlement, it was agreed that <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>'s interest in <ORGANIZATION> BHC </ORGANIZATION> would be distributed to <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> stockholders as part of the package of cash and securities comprising the second part of Time's tender offer for <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> In addition, <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> agreed to repurchase 1.3 million of <ORGANIZATION> BHC </ORGANIZATION>'s 6.5 million shares of <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Series </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> B </ORGANIZATION> convertible preferred stock for $ 143.7 million. That purchase will leave Chris-Craft with about 6 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>'s common and preferred stock, pending completion of the second half of the tender offer. The settlement also provided that the <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> stake in <ORGANIZATION> BHC </ORGANIZATION> that is being spun off to <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> shareholders will comprise 40 percent of the equity and 6.25 percent of the voting power in new <ORGANIZATION> BHC </ORGANIZATION>. Chris-Craft controls the rest. The settlement leaves unresolved Chris-Craft's assertion that it has the right to judge the fairness of the second phase of the tender offer for <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> because it is the lone holder of Warner Series B convertible preferred stock. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> contends no such right exists and the dispute remains at issue in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> Chancery Court.

<HEAD>New Car Battery Has a Built-In Spare</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 People who habitually leave the headlights on, the doors locked and the jumper cables at home are target customers for a new battery from <ORGANIZATION> GNB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> that has a built-in spare. The squarish Champion Switch combines a conventional 12-volt main battery and a reserve into a package that fits in about 70 percent of the cars on the road, GNB said. If the main battery dies because the lights were left on, the driver can flip a switch on it and start the car off the reserve. The reserve is good for 20 engine starts, just in case the engine keeps conking out, and both main battery and reserve can be recharged. The Champion Switch does well in sub-zero weather, especially with the reserve switched on, although that is not its main feature, said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatterschide </PERSON>, a GNB vice president for engineering. The suggested retail price is $ 109.99, roughly twice the price of conventional batteries, although some retailer discounting is likely. The battery goes on sale in Southeastern states around Oct. 1 and elsewhere in the country in 1990, as the factory in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, gears up production. It has been on sale in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> since November. Back-up batteries have not been popular because there was no room for them under the hood. GNB's Pulsar design makes it possible to create battery `` slices'' by re-grouping the positive and negative plates. The slice has the same voltage as a regular battery but less current. GNB is based in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, and is a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dunlop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Melbourne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. It is not connected with <ORGANIZATION> Champion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Spark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, although it has rights to use the Champion logo.

 <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> and one of its unions agreed on major issues of a new contract that could end a 13-day strike by next week, and <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telesis </ORGANIZATION> today reported substantial progress towards settling its own employee walkout, union and company officials said. A tentative agreement was worked out between <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday after more than two months of bargaining and a strike that slowed services to <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> customers in the <LOCATION> mid-Atlantic </LOCATION> states. Regional issues were resolved while leaving local issues to be worked out in further talks. <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> subsidiaries were to resume talks today with the <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> on the local issues. Bargaining also was to continue with the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brotherhood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electrical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>. Both unions also are striking another regional <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> company, <ORGANIZATION> NYNEX </ORGANIZATION>, which serves the Northeast. <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> alone is striking two other regional Bells: <ORGANIZATION> Ameritech </ORGANIZATION>, which serves five Midwestern states; and <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Telesis </LOCATION>, which serves <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Saviano </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> negotiators made `` very substantial progress yesterday'' and the day before, but there still were unresolved issues. Talks continued today. No contract talks were scheduled at <ORGANIZATION> NYNEX </ORGANIZATION> or Ameritech. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bickers </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Bell </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> agreement will have no direct effect on the other strikes, but `` hopefully this will give some impetus to those units to reach an agreement.'' Union officials said the <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> workers will not return to work at <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> until all local issues are resolved and the <ORGANIZATION> IBEW </ORGANIZATION> reaches agreement with the company. But both sides said a final accord could be reached within days. `` The major strike issues of wages and health benefits have been resolved,'' <PERSON> Bickers </PERSON> said at a news conference. `` This does not mean that the strike is over. But the way has been paved to resolve local issues. We are prepared to negotiate around the clock over the next several days to settle the outstanding issues.'' Company spokesman <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Clouser </PERSON> called the agreement `` very fair'' and one that balances the needs of employees, customers and shareowners. `` We're very confident and hopeful that it's both in our interest and the union's to have people back to work ... next week,'' <PERSON> Clouser </PERSON> said. The local issues include disputes over job-title and work-rule changes at each of <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION>'s subsidiaries in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. Wages and employee contributions to health-insurance plans have been major issues blocking settlement of the contracts with the four companies' nearly 200,000 employees in 20 states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. The striking workers include operators, telephone installers and repairmen, factory workers and some sales and clerical personnel. All four companies have continued service using management personnel, but there have been delays for customers seeking some installation and operator services. The tentative CWA-Bell <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> agreement calls for an immediate 3 percent pay raise for the 41,000 <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> workers. They would receive raises of 2 \ percent in both the second and final years of the contract The <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> workers also would receive a cost-of-living adjustment in the latter two years of the contract and a profit-sharing payment in all three years. Outside the headquarters of <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, picket <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Angela </PERSON> <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> said: `` Seven and a half percent is not much, but it's better than nothing. It'll feed my two kids.'' The union agreed to a `` managed care plan'' designed to provide improved benefits and prevent significant increases for out-of-pocket health care expenses _ if union workers use health care providers recommended by <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> has subsidiaries serving 12.7 million customers. It has 52,000 workers on strike, including about 11,000 <ORGANIZATION> IBEW </ORGANIZATION> workers. In other developments Thursday: _ Striking workers carried signs reading `` NYNEX Murderers'' at a memorial rally for a fellow striker who died Tuesday after falling off the hood of a car of a non-striking worker the day before At the rally outside <ORGANIZATION> NYNEX </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> said the union was calling for a `` complete and independent investigation'' into the death of <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Horgan </PERSON>. _ <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> investigated reports that vandals cut cables belonging to the strike-plagued <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, interrupting telephone service for as many as 5,000 customers Some service had been restored by midday. _ <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> officials sent striking workers a letter outlining a contract proposal union negotiators rejected The company said it had offered a 5 percent raise in the first year _ including a one-time bonus _ and 2.25 percent and 2.5 percent increases in the next two years; plus increases in health benefits, profit-sharing and retirement plans.

<HEAD>Wheat, Corn Futures Dip; Beans Gain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Wheat and corn futures prices dipped Friday on confirmation of large foreign purchases of those grains while soybean futures closed higher following a private forecast for a surprisingly small crop. The decline in the wheat and corn markets `` was a perfect example of buy the rumor, sell the fact,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Biedermann </PERSON>, director of research for <ORGANIZATION> Allendale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a futures brokerage in <LOCATION> Crystal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, Ill. The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> purchased more than 400,000 metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn Thursday and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> bought 150,000 metric tons of corn and 100,000 metric tons of wheat, the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain purchases by <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in two years. <PERSON> Biedermann </PERSON> said the foreign sales had been expected since Aug. 9, when several grain exporters bought large quantities of futures contracts, apparently to hedge purchases on the cash market of grain they planned to sell overseas. Soybean prices were buoyed by active cash markets for soybean meal and oil, and by crop estimates from <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, Tenn.-based <ORGANIZATION> Sparks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commodities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a private analytical firm, that were lower than the government projections issued last week. Sparks pegged the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION> soybean crop at 1.84 billion bushels compared to the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s estimate of 1.91 billion, and <PERSON> Sparks </PERSON> pegged the corn crop at 7.05 billion bushels compared to the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s projected 7.35 billion At the close, wheat was 2 cents to 5 cents lower with the contract for delivery in September at $ 3.92 \ a bushel; corn was 1 -LCB- cents lower to 1 \ cents higher with September at $ 2.35 \ a bushel; oats were unchanged to 1 cent higher with September at $ 1.38 a bushel; soybeans were 5 cents lower to 8 cents higher with August at $ 6.16

 A group of <PERSON> Leonardo </PERSON> <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Vinci </PERSON> drawings, renamed after <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> Armand </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammer </PERSON> and represented as part of his foundation's art collection, were actually bought for $ 5 million by the oil company, documents in a shareholders' lawsuit show Books and brochures published by the <ORGANIZATION> Armand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hammer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> maintained it had purchased the sketches, renamed the `` Codex Hammer.'' However, depositions unsealed Thursday in <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chancery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> at the request of the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> and the Wall Street Journal show the 1980 purchase was paid for by <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION>. The Times described extensive donations of <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> funds to Hammer charities in the last 10 years. Hammer, 91, declined requests for comment. The industrialist has an art collection valued at more than $ 250 million. He has given huge sums to charity, among other things funding anti-cancer research and helping victims of the <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> nuclear disaster in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the war in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. But the shareholders say in their lawsuit against Hammer, <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION>, and its board of directors that ostensibly charitable gifts by <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> are actually designed to glorify Hammer, and are a waste of corporate funds. The suit seeks to block <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION>'s commitment of $ 55 million to $ 160 million to build and endow the <ORGANIZATION> Armand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hammer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. Hammer's attorneys contend the directors have acted legally and in accord with their duty to the corporation in making donations that promote good will toward <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> while benefiting society. The court records show that from 1982 to this year, <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION>, after votes of its board of directors, gave nearly $ 33 million to four organizations associated with Hammer _ two of which bear his name. `` I think it clearly is within the discretion of the board of directors to make those donations,'' said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Kauffman </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> attorney representing Hammer in the case. `` It is good for the corporation to be associated with museums, stopping cancer, world peace,'' <PERSON> Kauffman </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. Hammer did not return a phone call seeking comment Friday. <PERSON> Kauffman </PERSON> had no direct answer to why <PERSON> Hammer </PERSON> had represented the purchase of <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Vinci </PERSON> sketches as being his foundation's instead of the company's. `` I'm not sufficiently familiar with the details to comment on that,'' <PERSON> Kauffman </PERSON> said. But he said, `` I do n't know of any time that Dr. <PERSON> Hammer </PERSON> has tried to make it look as though he alone was the source of the foundation money,'' although he said Hammer has donated $ 45 million of his own money to the foundation over the years. Hammer announced plans for the art museum bearing his name in 1988 after he withdrew a commitment to give his collection to the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Museum of Art. The court records show Hammer withdrew his pledge after administrators at the county museum balked at his demands to strip galleries of the names of previous donors and devote an entire museum wing to Hammer's art. He insisted that no other work could be displayed with the Hammer collection. The museum was `` treating me not as a donor but as somebody that frankly they could push around,'' Hammer recalled in a deposition, `` and I was n't going to be pushed around.'' The records also show that <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> _ not Hammer or his foundation _ gave a $ 2 million gift to the county Museum of Art in 1980 to build a bridge connecting two wings of the museum and an escalator. In a 1980 press release issued by the <ORGANIZATION> Armand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hammer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> and in a deposition Hammer gave in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> in June, Hammer maintained he had financed the gift himself or through the foundation. But Hammer, in a deposition taken under oath, acknowledged that was not so after an attorney for dissident shareholder <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahn </PERSON> showed Hammer records indicating that the money was <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION>'s. A <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> filing obtained separately indicates that in the event of Hammer's death, <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> is obligated to continue paying Hammer's salary to the foundation until February 1998, the Times said. Hammer is paid about $ 2 million yearly in salary and stock options, but <PERSON> Kauffman </PERSON> said about 95 percent of that is given to charity. <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> records show that it donated $ 32.8 million in a seven-year period ending earlier this year to four charities associated with Hammer. Of those, $ 5.9 million went directly to the <ORGANIZATION> Armand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hammer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. Another $ 20 million was given to the <ORGANIZATION> Armand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hammer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. In 1985, <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> made $ 16.3 million in charitable donations, $ 13.3 million of it to Hammer-associated organizations. That total represented 6.33 percent of the total money paid out as dividends to <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> shareholders. <PERSON> Kauffman </PERSON> said those donations were an effective form of public relations for <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION>, which does not sell anything directly to the public and thus has a harder time than many corporations in promoting itself. `` They're helping promote the company as well as helping society,'' he said.

 A late rally helped push the stock market higher just before the close today after a fairly quiet, mixed day of trading. The market opened weak in response to a drop in the bond market after a <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report that showed consumer inflation rose 0.2 percent in July. Although the number was in line with expectations, investors focused on the 0.4 percent rise in the Consumer Price Index excluding food and energy, the most volatile components, analysts said. The data was interpreted as another indication that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> was unlikely to lower interest rates. The bond market later changed direction, pulling stocks along with it. `` The bond market tells the whole story,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Jensen </PERSON>, chief technical analyst with <ORGANIZATION> MKI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` Stocks followed along with the reaction of the bond market.'' Although some blue-chip issues showed strong gains, the market remained generally trendless with the broader market lagging behind. Airline stocks helped push the Dow Jones transportation average higher. <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, parent of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, rose amid news that it had two new potential bidders. <PERSON> McGraw </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> stock also gained strongly as speculation resurfaced that <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> was interested in buying the company.

 <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s stock price continued gaining altitude Friday as speculators bet that suitors which reportedly now include <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> investor <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bass </PERSON> and a team of <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> would engage in a bidding war. <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> rose $ 4.62 -LCB- a share at $ 271 late Friday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. That followed a gain of $ 14.62 -LCB- on Thursday and more than $ 90 a share overall since a buyout proposal by <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> investor <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> was disclosed some two weeks ago. `` My guess is that the interest ranges from very serious on the part of some firms to others who are just exploring the feasibility of getting involved,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Decker </PERSON>, airline analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Duff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Phelps </LOCATION>. `` Other than <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' bid, there is n't enough information out there to make an educated guess. But it's my sense that we're approaching the upper limits of what anybody is going to pay for the company,'' he said. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> on Wednesday sweetened his proposal to $ 6.19 billion, or $ 275 a share, from the initial $ 5.4 billion, or $ 240 a share and has indicated he might be willing to go even higher after reviewing internal company data. <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>'s directors met Thursday and later stated it was premature to decide whether the company would be sold. <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> confirmed it had been contacted by other potential bidders and had held discussions with an employee group, but declined to identify any of the parties. In addition to Bass and British <LOCATION> Airways-Morgan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stanley </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has stated it was interested in a possible merger with <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>, the parent of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. Also said to be eyeing <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> are the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> unit of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which represents <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s 7,125 pilots and offered unsuccessfully to buy the company in 1987; and Chairman <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>, who reportedl is exploring a bid by current <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> management, possibly in conjunction with the pilots. All of the groups declined to comment Friday, citing policies regarding speculative reports. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Dornacker </PERSON> said the company would not expand on its comments made after the board meeting Thursday, although she said the directors' next regularly scheduled meeting was Sept. 27. In a statement issued early Friday, <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said he and his associates were awaiting `` with interest the board's conclusions and continue to look forward to working with <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>'s board, management and labor groups to develop a transaction that works to the benefit of all parties concerned.'' `` My guess is that they're buying time to continue with their own analysis of what <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> is worth,'' said <PERSON> Decker </PERSON>. `` Once they get that completed, they'll be in better position to decide who they talk with and about how much.'' <PERSON> Decker </PERSON> also said the pilots' union likely was being courted _ or would be _ by any group with serious designs on acquiring <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's improbable any deal could be done without some form of cooperation from the pilots, and probably the machinists as well,'' he said. `` It may not come down to a share of ownership _ though that's possible _ but any acquirer would have a hard time getting financing without some promise of cooperation. `` That gives lenders comfort that they wo n't be facing a strike,'' he said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> is preparing to offer a guarantee to motorists, contending that its expensive Ultimate Premium gasoline wo n't damage a car's fuel system. The oil company says this will be the only gasoline with its own written guarantee, but critics say it's not much of a bargain. `` Gasolines typically do n't cause problems unless, for instance, water gets in the fuel tank,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherwood </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> product design engineer. <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION> said that beginning Monday it will reimburse car owners for repairs of any fuel system damage caused by gasoline in which the owner has used Ultimate Premium regularly in a new car. The guarantee is good through the first 75,000 miles of operation or until the car is sold or contract terminated for leased cars. The guarantee applies to cars, vans, light trucks or light-duty four-wheel-drive vehicles, and covers repairs to such parts as fuel injectors, carburetors, intake valves and ports, intake manifold, fuel pump, fuel injection pump, fuel regulator, fuel rail, fuel lines and fuel tank sending unit. Owners and lessees can register for the guarantee on forms available in <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION> stations. <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ultimate </ORGANIZATION> has a detergent additive.

<HEAD>Two `Hard Landings' at Eastern Due to New Pilots, ALPA Charges</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-UAL, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>

 Unsafe landings occurred on two <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> flights recently because of inexperienced pilots hired to replace strikers, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> contended Friday. But both <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and the federal agency responsible for air safety disputed the claims. The union representing pilots at most major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines said the incidents involved `` hard landings'' at airports in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. The airplanes were damaged in both cases but there were no injuries, the pilots union said. A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> incident, in which a tail cone fell off, did n't involve a hard landing but was due to a mechanical malfunction. In the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> case, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> performed the required inspection after the hard landing, replaced the affected parts and put the plane back into service, said the spokesman, <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON>. `` These are not inexperienced pilots,'' <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON> said from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. He said the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>'s information on the incidents was based on reports made by Eastern. Eastern spokeswoman <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceremsak </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> confirmed that the incidents occurred, but said they were not caused by the pilots being unseasoned. The <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> incident resulted from a mechanical problem and was not a hard landing, while the hard landing in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> apparently was due to weather conditions or the jet being overweight, she said. `` Inexperienced pilots were not a factor,'' Ms. <PERSON> Ceremsak </PERSON> said. `` This is another example of the pilots attempting to string unrelated incidents together to further their cause.'' The pilots association made the charges in a statement released from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, where its executive council is considering calling for a nationwide suspension of service on virtually all domestic carriers to show support for Eastern's strikers. The pilots union struck Eastern on March 4 in sympathy with a walkout by the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union. But veteran pilots by the dozens crossed picket lines last week and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> last Friday said it had stopped hiring new pilots or taking strikers back. Of the four pilots involved in the two incidents, three were hired by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> since the strike and one had little experience in the type of aircraft he was flying at the time, the pilots union said. `` While ` hard landings' are not unheard of in everyday airline operations, it is unusual to find two of them involving new-hire pilots in such a short period of time at the same airline,'' the statement read. `` These incidents illustrate the ongoing problems that <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> has had because of its inexperienced pilot group.'' The pilots union said its information was obtained from observation posts and by monitoring radio frequencies at major airports where Eastern operates. In the first incident, on July 29 in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell-Douglas </ORGANIZATION> DC-9 aircraft lost its tail cone because of the impact of a hard landing, according to the pilots union. The inflatable evacuation slide also was jarred loose and trailed the plane on the ground as it taxied to the gate, it said. But <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Ceremsak </PERSON> said the tail cone came off because a lever attached to it released accidentally. `` There is no evidence of a hard landing,'' <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON> said, referring to the DC-9 episode. The first officer, who was flying the approach, was a new hire, the pilots union said. It said the captain was an Eastern veteran but he had spent most of his time at the carrier as an instructor or in the position of second officer, a non-flying post. In the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> incident on Aug. 12, a <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> L-1011 jumbo jet bounced on the runway during a landing attempt, the pilots union said. The pilots aborted the landing, performed a `` go around'' for another approach and successfully completed the second attempt, the union said. The captain and the first officer were both new hires, the statement said. The pilots union said the damaged aircraft was still in a hangar. <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Ceremsak </PERSON> disputed that claim, saying the L-1011 sustained no damage and was put back in service after some of the seals on its landing gear were replaced.

<TEXT>
 The dollar slipped in worldwide trading Friday as dealers cashed in on the currency's dramatic run-up in the previous session. Gold prices were mixed. On the Commodity Exchange in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, gold bullion for current delivery lost 20 cents to finish at $ 368.10 a troy ounce. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> said gold was bid later at $ 366 an ounce, down 20 cents from Thursday. Buying interest in the dollar abated following the climb triggered by Thursday's release of a better-than-expected <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade report for July, which boosted the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency to levels not seen since its most recent rally in June. `` The dollar is right back to where we were before the trade number came out,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON>, a trader with <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report released Friday showed that drops in energy and clothing prices held the rise in July consumer prices to just 0.2 percent, a further indication that inflation is restrained. But traders characterized the report as a non-event since it was largely within expectations. `` Most people are anticipating the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- will not be easing interest rates in the next week or two,'' <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON> said. With a battery of Japanese government bonds due to mature next week, traders were speculating whether any of that money would flow to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> securities. But the threat of central bank intervention overseas during the weekend made them reluctant to bid the dollar higher. The dollar held to a narrow range, and trading was active, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ogg </PERSON>, a vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Suisse </ORGANIZATION>. Earlier in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar closed at 143.52 Japanese yen, up from 142.32. Later in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar traded lower at 142.75 yen. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the dollar closed at 142.60 yen, down from 143.53 yen on Thursday. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, one British pound cost at cost $ 1.5655 late Friday, more expensive for buyers than Thursday's late $ 1.5590. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, one pound cost $ 1.5659, more expensive than $ 1.5605 on Thursday. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late Thursday included: 1.9562 West German marks, down from 1.9637; 1.6855 Swiss francs, down from 1.6925; 6.5955 French francs, down from 6.6280; 1,403.00 Italian lire, down from 1,412.25, and 1.1178 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1819. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Thursday included: 1.9555 West German marks, down from 1.9690; 1.6860 Swiss francs, down from 1.6980; 6.5945 French francs, down from 6.6325; 2.2080 Dutch guilders, down from 2.2190; 1,405.75 Italian lire, down from 1,412.00, and 1.1787 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1815. Gold prices were higher overseas. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, gold closed at $ 366.65 bid a troy ounce, up from $ 366.35. The Zurich closing price was a bid $ 366.75, up from $ 365.25. Earlier in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold closed at $ 366.50 bid, up from $ 366.45. Silver prices were mixed.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Narrowly Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Bond prices finished mixed Friday as buying by bargain-hunters offset the early prices declines that followed the latest consumer inflation report. Prices of long-term <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> and corporate bonds edged up, but prices of shorter-term <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> issues and tax-exempt bonds slipped. The price of the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s benchmark 30-year bond rose 1-16 point, or less than $ 1 for every $ 1,000 in face value, as its yield dipped to 8.15 percent from 8.16 percent late Thursday. Prices fell after the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that its Consumer Price Index rose 0.2 percent in July. While that increase was widely expected, some traders were disappointed by a 0.4 percent rise in prices other than for food and energy. That increase was up from a 0.3 percent increase in June. <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Flanagan </PERSON>, money market economist for <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said that while the report was `` nothing alarming, the market was being skittish.'' He said any indication that inflation is accelerating encourages speculation that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> will not soon relax its credit policy. He said there were also concerns that brokerage houses that bought <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> issues auctioned last week were still trying to find buyers for the securities. But <PERSON> Flanagan </PERSON> said prices moved higher later in the day, recovering most of the day's lost ground as buyers emerged at the higher yields. In the secondary market for <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds, prices of short-term issues lost -LRB- point, intermediate securities fell 3-32 point and long-term issues rose as much as 3-32 point, according to figures provided by <ORGANIZATION> Telerate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a financial information service. The movement of a point equals a change of $ 10 in the price of a bond with a $ 1,000 face value. The <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Bond Index, which measures price movements on all outstanding <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> issues with maturities of a year or longer, fell 0.72 to 1,177.36. Corporate bonds prices edged up. <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>'s Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures total return on a portfolio of 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, rose 0.22 to 328.25. In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal bonds fell -LRB- point. The average yield to maturity rose to 7.32 percent from 7.31 percent late Thursday. Yields on three-month <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills fell to 8.09 percent as the discount dropped 5 basis points to 7.83 percent. Yields on six-month bills rose to 8.28 percent as the discount rose 1 basis point to 7.85 percent. Yields on one-year bills rose to 8.30 percent as the discount rose 2 basis points to 7.73 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the annualized return on an investment in a <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bill. The discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face value, paid at maturity. The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was quoted at 8 ~ percent, unchanged from late Thursday

 The stock market closed higher Friday, ending with a rally after a relatively quiet session. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 8.34 points to finish at 2,687.97, a gain of 3.98 points on the week. Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 7 to 6 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 776 issues up, 661 down and 544 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> totaled 145.81 million shares, down from 157.56 million in the previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 174.245 million shares. Stocks opened weaker in response to a slide in the bond market after a <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report on consumer prices that raised concern about the inflation outlook over the next few months. The Labor Department's Consumer Price Index rose 0.2 percent in July, in line with the market consensus. `` People felt that since it was in line with expectations, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> would n't have to ease credit at the present time,'' said <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Weeks </PERSON>, head of equity trading at the investment firm of <ORGANIZATION> Donaldson </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lufkin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Jenrette </PERSON>. But without food and energy costs, the most volatile components of the index, consumer prices rose a heftier 0.4 percent, raising inflation worries. `` The report looks good on the surface but when you read further in there is concern that we have seen the lows in inflation and will be moving higher in the months ahead,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Solloway </PERSON>, economist with <ORGANIZATION> Argus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Stocks firmed slightly at midday as bonds turned higher and by late afternoon prices were strengthening But uncertainty about the impact of the the so-called `` double witching hour'' _ the expiration of stock-index futures and options that do n't expire quarterly _ dampened the rally. Volume remained low throughout the session with computerized program strategies dominating most of the activity, said Weeks. As measured by <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>' index of more than 5,000 actively traded stocks, the market gained $ 12.033 billion, or 0.36 percent, in value from Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks added 0.69 to 192.64. Among actively traded issues on the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> rose 4 | to 271 amid reports that the company had drawn two more potential bidders <PERSON> McGraw </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> gained 6 to 85 -LCB- on renewed speculation that <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> might make a bid for the company. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Utilities rose -LRB- to 32 -RRB-, <ORGANIZATION> Maytag </ORGANIZATION> advanced 1 -RCB- to 23 \ and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> gained \ to 58 Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> closed down 1 -LCB- at 156 -LCB-, <ORGANIZATION> Navistar </ORGANIZATION> fell -LRB- to 4 -RCB- and <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> remained unchanged at 43 -RCB-. <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's industrial index rose 1.57 to 395.84, and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P's 500-stock composite index went up 1.58 to 346.03 The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market finished at 461.97, 1.14 higher.

 Oil futures ended a lackluster week by finishing mixed Friday, with no major developments to influence prices. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the September contract for <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Intermediate, the benchmark grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude oil, rose 12 cents to close at $ 18.80 per 42-gallon barrel. Contract months for later delivery were narrowly mixed. Among refined products traded on the exchange, unleaded regular gasoline for September delivery edged up 0.38 cent to 52.73 cents a gallon. Heating oil futures for September slipped 0.01 cent lower, settling at 51.03 cents a gallon. Analysts said the market was driven mainly by technical factors in the absence of news on oil supplies or production. `` It just fits into technical wiggle and jiggle,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Beutel </PERSON>, assistant director of the energy group at <ORGANIZATION> Elders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The oil market has been in the summer doldrums for some time. Traders are looking forward to Labor Day for a pickup in activity and beyond that to the next scheduled meeting, on Sept. 23, of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.

<HEAD>Copper Futures Rally Ends On Profit-Taking and Easing Tensions in
Peru</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Profit-taking put an end to a seven-day runup in copper futures prices Friday on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> but chart-watchers said technical signals pointed toward further gains. `` This might actually help,'' analyst <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Platt </PERSON>, of <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said of the moderately steep decline. He said the market had fallen back to prices it had skipped over on its way up and cited a theory that markets must fill such gaps before resuming a trend. On other futures markets Friday, precious metals retreated while futures prices for energy, grains, soybeans, livestock and meat were mixed. Copper settled 1.50 cents to 2.35 cents lower with the contract for spot delivery at $ 1.2465 a pound and the more actively traded September contract at $ 1.2390. Spot prices had climbed as high as $ 1.2680 on Thursday, which represented a gain of more than 15 percent since Aug. 8. The rally had been linked to indications that production problems, including ongoing miner strikes in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, were beginning to make a dent in copper stockpiles. Analysts said Friday's decline was largely a due to pre-weekend profit-taking after the nearly vertical run-up. <PERSON> Platt </PERSON> said prospects for a settlement of the 5-day-old Peruvian strike appeared to be improving. He said the miners must return to work to qualify for wage bonuses and some observers believe those bonuses are enough incentive to bring the strike to an end. But both <PERSON> Platt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardillo </PERSON>, commodities trading adviser with <ORGANIZATION> Josephthal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said the market continued to look strong from a technical perspective. Gold and silver futures prices fell slightly on the <ORGANIZATION> Comex </ORGANIZATION> in response to the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s report of a modest 0.2 percent rise in consumer prices last month. Low inflation rates or falling prices tend to discourage investor buying of precious metals. Gold settled 20 cents to 70 cents lower with August at $ 368.10 a troy ounce; silver was .08 cent to 1 cent lower with September at $ 5.255 a troy ounce. Wheat and corn futures prices retreated on confirmation of large foreign purchases of those grains while soybean futures closed higher following a private forecast for a surprisingly small crop. Memphis-based <ORGANIZATION> Sparks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commodities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> pegged the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION> soybean crop at 1.84 billion bushels compared to the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s estimate last week of 1.91 billion, and <PERSON> Sparks </PERSON> pegged the corn crop at 7.05 billion bushels compared to the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s projected 7.35 billion Wheat settled 1 -LCB- cents to 5 cents lower with September at $ 3.92 \ a bushel; corn was unchanged to 1 \ cents lower with September at $ 2.34 -RCB- a bushel; oats were unchanged to 1 \ cents higher with September at $ 1.38 \ a bushel; soybeans were 4 \ cents lower to 7 -RCB- cents higher with August at $ Reports of a gasoline refinery shutdown in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> boosted gasoline futures prices on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Crude oil futures were mixed and heating oil was lower. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 4 cents lower to 12 cents higher with September at $ 18.80 a barrel; heating oil was .01 cent to .07 cent lower with September at 51.03 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .15 cent lower to .38 cent higher with September at 52.73 cents a gallon. Livestock and meat futures were narrowly mixed on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where the August contracts for live cattle and hogs expired Friday. August live cattle finished 2 cents higher at 73.97 cents a pound; August hogs ended .90 cent higher at 48.75 cents a pound. Other live cattle contracts settled .08 cent lower to .20 cent higher with September at 74.75 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .08 cent lower to .18 cent higher with August at 84.57 cents a pound; hogs were .15 cent lower to .40 cent higher with October at 41.05 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were unchanged to .40 cent higher with August at 27.17 cents a pound.

<HEAD>Charge It and Save Money: Brazilian Credit Card Industry Thriving</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Credit card use is booming in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> because of hyper-inflation, which makes it worthwhile for shoppers to buy now and pay later. Consumers are using plastic to pay for everything from newspapers and samba dance classes to ritual voodoo costumes, as a way to beat the merry-go-round of price hikes. Because there's no finance charge if bills are paid promptly at the end of the month, shopping by credit card in effect can lock in prices that prevailed at the time purchases were made. A year ago, 3.6 million credit cards were circulating in the country of 145 million people, industry figures show. Today there are 6.2 million, and card marketing directors predict the number will quintuple by 1993. `` You're looking at the hottest market in the services sector in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> today,'' said <PERSON> Paulo </PERSON> <PERSON> Veras </PERSON> <PERSON> Bica </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> Banco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nacional </ORGANIZATION>'s Visa card Foreign card companies are scrambling to exploit the demand, foreseeing a continuous growth in the buying power of Brazilian consumers despite the country's staggering economic problems. <ORGANIZATION> Mastercard </ORGANIZATION>, which in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> is associated with <LOCATION> Credicard </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s most popular card with 2.2 million users, has more than doubled its number of card-holders in the last two years. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> card membership rose to 480,000 in June, a 30 percent increase since 1987. <ORGANIZATION> Diners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> saw its clientele triple in two years, to 300,000 in July. Visa associated with two of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s largest commercial banks, <ORGANIZATION> Banco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> do </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brasil </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Banco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nacional </ORGANIZATION>, and gained nearly 1 million clients since last year. `` We were just another card that belonged to a bank and we were fading into the sunset. Associating ourselves with <PERSON> Visa </PERSON> gave us prestige, validity and credibility,'' said <PERSON> Bica </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Banco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nacional </ORGANIZATION>'s credit director In return, Visa is benefiting from an influx of foreign tourists, who find more Brazilian merchants willing to accept cards. The company looks forward to the day when the government allows Brazilians to use cards abroad, a practice now prohibited as a way of protecting <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s foreign currency reserves. `` Visa is gambling that soon Brazilians will be able to use their cards when they travel,'' said <PERSON> Ruben </PERSON> <PERSON> Osta </PERSON>, Finance Director for <ORGANIZATION> Banco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nacional </ORGANIZATION>'s Visa card. `` They want to be here first when the government gives the go-ahead.'' Brazilians are not yet as addicted to plastic money as <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> cardholders, who pack an average of eight cards. But that too is changing rapidly. `` Brazilians are going through a change in culture,'' said <PERSON> Marcio </PERSON> <PERSON> Souza </PERSON>, director for the <LOCATION> Bradesco </LOCATION> bank's credit card, the No. 2 card in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> with 1.85 million clients. `` These days, credit cards are more than a buying tool or a means of getting a loan _ they're becoming a business and social credential.'' A shift in banking practices underlies the trend. Checks, the predominant form of payment during the last decade, are relinquishing ground to automated credit transactions because banks are reducing paperwork and costs. Security, convenience, and incentives such as 24-hour computerized tellers and instant access to bank accounts also are winning new members. `` <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> is entering the modern age of banking and consuming,'' said <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Rozwadowski </PERSON>, who heads the Brazilian operations of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>. `` There is a tremendous upsurge in card usage,'' says Osta, of <ORGANIZATION> Banco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nacional </ORGANIZATION>. Unprecedented marketing drives are spreading plastic to far-off rural regions. `` It's not easy convincing shop owners in jungle or mining towns why they should accept a card instead of cash or gold,'' says <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> <PERSON> Machado </PERSON>, credit card director at <ORGANIZATION> Banco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> do </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brasil </ORGANIZATION>, a government-controlled commercial bank, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s largest. `` But we're doing it.'' <PERSON> Machado </PERSON> said more than 75 percent of Brazilian cities with populations under 500,000 now accept the <ORGANIZATION> Banco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> do </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brasil-Visa </ORGANIZATION> card, called Ourocard or `` Gold Card.'' Not even a dip in workers' buying clout and a deep economic decline last year daunt the expectations of card companies. `` The underground economy makes up at least 40 percent of the total economy,'' said <PERSON> Bica </PERSON>. `` And as it grows, people will have more and more disposable income on the side to spend.'' Nonetheless, there is concern that the country's relentless inflation rate could boomerang on the credit-card issuers. In July alone the cost of living rose 28.76 percent, and August inflation is expected to be even higher. Computed over the last 12 months, annual inflation averages 1,000 percent. Some merchants have taken matters into their own hands by boycotting credit cards because of delayed reimbursement by card issuers. Others have begun charging card customers 45 percent more than cash-paying clients, a practice that is illegal but growing. `` Credit cards are supposed to be cash payment,'' complained <PERSON> Denise </PERSON> <PERSON> Neueschwander </PERSON>, 34, a <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> housewife. `` But no one seems to know that here.'' Some critics warn that turning <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> into a credit card society could fuel inflation even more, and eventually compel the government to take drastic measures to curb their use, which could help incite a recession. But marketing directors dismiss the notion. `` It's a fantastic future market,'' said <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> <PERSON> Vinicius </PERSON> <PERSON> Araujo </PERSON>, spokesman for <LOCATION> Credicard </LOCATION>. `` We're not worried.''

<HEAD>Savings Certificates Use Gimmicks To Lure Depositors</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Free toasters are history. Today's banks offer thrills, excitement and chance to prospective depositors. Support your favorite baseball team. Take a chance on the weather. Help an environmental cause. These are among the gimmicks banks are using to lure new accounts. <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION>, has offered certificates of deposit that encourage customers to `` put your money where your mouth is'' by investing in a CD with an interest rate that increases each time either the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sox </ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION> Yankees </ORGANIZATION> win. A <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> bank offers a CD with an interest rate that varies with the daily temerature. `` From a competitors point of view, it's easier just to hike a rate,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION>'s senior vice president in products and services. But the `` more creative type of deposit strategy _ one that generates more enthusiasm and interest,'' helps broadens the market by targeting unconventional CD depositors, he said. The method appears to work. Fleet has offered sports CDs since 1986, when the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Celtics </ORGANIZATION> were seeking their 16th NBA championship. `` We've been quite pleased with the results,'' said <PERSON> Howe </PERSON>. The trick was to guess the number of points the <ORGANIZATION> Celtics </ORGANIZATION> would score in the final game. Those who guessed correctly saw their CD jump to 16 percent from 7 percent for the full three-month term. When <ORGANIZATION> Providence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> took on the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rhode </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> at basketball in 1987, the bank capitalized on a long-standing feud by offering a CD with an interest rate that increased one-twentieth of 1 percent for every game the customer's chosen team won. Fleet continued the sports tradition with a `` Home Team'' CD offered last fall in which the interest rate rose each time the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bruins </ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Celtics </ORGANIZATION> won a home game. This year Fleet reoffered a baseball CD geared to the <ORGANIZATION> Yankees-Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sox </ORGANIZATION> rivalry. Only available before the teams met for the first time June 8, the CD increases one-tenth of 1 percent from then on each time the customer's chosen team wins. If the chosen team wins the American League Championship, the CD would receive a 1 percent bonus on the total deposit. The <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> State Police, responsible for enforcing the state's anti-gambling laws, say they have investigated the sports CDs and determined they are legal. `` You are really not gambling,'' said Sgt. <PERSON> Terrance </PERSON> <PERSON> Burgess </PERSON> of internal affairs. ` They are gong to give out a flat CD rate anyway so the element of chance, if it's there, is almost non-existent. You ca n't lose.'' The baseball CD required a $ 1,000 minimum deposit and offered a fixed rate of 9 \ percent for a six-month deposit <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> would not say how many sports CDs have been taken out. `` I think the fact that the bank has offered multiple sports CDs suggests that they are well recieved by the <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> public,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Rhode </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islanders </ORGANIZATION> are n't the only ones who have welcomed the innovation. <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, for example, offered a similar CD based on the <ORGANIZATION> Yankees </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Mets </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Cheshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> offered a `` Heat Wave'' CD so unusual it took more than a month to catch on. The interest rate on the three-month CD is 10 percent of whatever the day's high is in <LOCATION> Concord </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>. After October, the rates will be based on the temperature in <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION> If the temperature is a record high for the day, the CD would increase a half a percent more, said <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Colby </PERSON>, a customer service representative at <LOCATION> Cheshire </LOCATION>. The rate is guaranteed not to drop below 7.5 percent and has peaked at 9.75 percent since it began July 11. `` It took a little while for people to see what it's all about,'' she said. `` It's picking up.'' The CD, which requires a $ 500 minimum deposit, appeals to young people, partly because of the low investment and also because of the unusual terms, she said. `` Older people are more apt to want a fixed interest rate,'' said <PERSON> Colby </PERSON>. `` Younger people tend to gamble a little more.'' Fleet targeted another market with a CD it offered in the aftermath of an oil spill off the coast of <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>, earlier this summer, agreeing to donate to Save the Bay $ 1 per $ 1,000 deposited up to a maximum of $ 50,000. `` The oil spill in the bay obviously increased the awareness of most <ORGANIZATION> Rhode </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islanders </ORGANIZATION> to the environment,'' said <PERSON> Howe </PERSON>. `` So we felt the timing of this product was really good.''

A class-action suit was filed against the airline by shareholders citing <ORGANIZATION> PBA </ORGANIZATION>'s failure to disclose a long-standing investigation of the airline by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. `` According to federal securities laws, an investor must be given all of the necessary information to make an intelligent decision and this obviously was not the case here,'' said <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrmann </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Saddle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brook </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, attorney who represented the shareholders in the 4 -LCB- - year-old suit `` I'm delighted that the shareholders received a return on their investment and in most cases, a complete recovery of the damages they suffered as a result of the defendant's action,'' <PERSON> Herrmann </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> PBA </ORGANIZATION> ran into troubles during a rapid expansion in the mid-1980s, most notably two fatal air crashes in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Court Judge <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> approved the settlement.

 <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> said Friday that negotiations have lapsed in its attempt to buy routes and other property for sale by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, which is undergoing bankruptcy reorganization because of a strike. `` As far as we know, discussions are in abeyance. Things change so much we're not exactly sure what they're trying to sell,'' said <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>. Discussions had been on-and-off, she said, but `` we got the indication that they were n't looking to sell.'' Miami-based <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> had expressed interest in selling airport property and its South American routes as part of a profound restructuring to re-emerge from bankruptcy as a smaller airline. Eastern spokeswoman <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceremsak </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> said, `` There has been no final decision to sell <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, and to the extent that there have been discussions, we would not want to comment.'' Eastern President <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakes </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> the carrier will be selling fewer assets than anticipated when it first began trying to come back from its March 4 strike and subsequent Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization. Bakes would n't go into details on the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> route negotiations and said he did n't `` want to set odds'' on whether they would be sold. `` We will have more employees, it will service more cities and we'll have more airplanes,'' Bakes said in an interview. Eastern at first said it would need to sell $ 1.8 billion in assets, but Bakes on Wednesday trimmed that estimate to $ 1.5 billion.

 Striking <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> workers, making a 3,000-mile `` Journey for Justice'' to dramatize their plight, were greeted by brewery workers Friday during a rally on the edge of a south <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> pecan orchard. About 28 pilots, flight attendants and machinists stopped in <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION> to gather donations and collect signatures for a petition that asks President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to appoint a trustee to run the troubled airline. `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> goes to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and embraces the labor leaders over there, yet he wo n't give us the time of day,'' said pilot <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Davison </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Baytown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` Our goal is to get a trustee appointed to get the airline and the workers back to work.'' The Eastern workers inflated a blue and white hot-air ballon with pro-union messages, sold T-shirts to bolster strike funds and passed out bumper stickers during their <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION> rally. About 30 workers from the nearby <ORGANIZATION> Miller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brewing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> plant joined them in a hot, dusty field. The brewery workers are members of Local 2699 of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>, the same union that represents Eastern machinists. The airline's machinists went on strike March 4, and most of the its pilots and flight attendants decided not to cross their picket lines. <PERSON> Davison </PERSON> said the main issue in the dispute is <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which owns <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and sister carrier <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Davison </PERSON> contended <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> is trying to destroy the unions and dismantle Eastern by selling off its assets.

<HEAD>GE's Lynn Plant Wins Navy Contract</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said Friday that <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> won a heated competition with <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Whitney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> to produce engines for F-A18 Hornet jets. GE estimated the eventual value of the contract at up to $ 2 billion. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> placed an immediate order for 132 of the F-404 turbofan engines, which are assembled at <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION>'s plant in <LOCATION> Lynn </LOCATION>. In addition, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> would be the `` sole source'' for all additional purchases of the engines, a status <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> had enjoyed until 1984. In an unusual move five years ago, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> forced <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> to turn over plans for the F-404 engines to <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Whitney </LOCATION> in an effort to stimulate competition and reduce costs. Since then, <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON>, a division of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, has been a second source of the engines, which cost between $ 1 million and $ 2 million apiece. In <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON>, where GE has eliminated 4,300 jobs over the past 2 -LCB- years, there was `` a great deal of relief and happiness'' Friday, said company spokesman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Salvucci </PERSON>. <PERSON> Salvucci </PERSON> said 1,500 employees have been working on the engines, and 100 to 150 more workers will be added in the second quarter of 1990 because of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s decision. The F-A18, a carrier-based fighter and attack jet, is used by the Canadian, Australian and Spanish air forces as well as the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and Marines. It has also recently been selected by the governments of <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s decision would have no immediate impact on employment in <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, because the company has a backlog of orders that will last into 1991. <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Whitney </LOCATION> spokesman <PERSON> Brayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said the company would not speculate on the eventual impact.

 A 3-week-old labor dispute ended Friday after the governor of <LOCATION> Tamaulipas </LOCATION> negotiated an agreement between rival union factions, the director of a business organization said. The resolution means the northeastern state of <LOCATION> Tamaulipas </LOCATION> will have its first major labor union independent of the powerful <ORGANIZATION> Mexican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>, or CTM. `` The -LRB- strike -RRB- flags are coming down right at this moment,'' <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> McAllen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said Friday afternoon. <LOCATION> McAllen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, is across the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Reynosa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> did not provide details on how the agreement was reached. The governor's office was unavailable for comment immediately. The strike pit the head of the local union, <PERSON> Abel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>, against the <ORGANIZATION> CTM </ORGANIZATION>. After <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> pulled the local union out of the <ORGANIZATION> CTM </ORGANIZATION>, the local <ORGANIZATION> CTM </ORGANIZATION> leader, <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Morales </PERSON>, called the strike on July 25 and declared himself head of the local. The labor board, controlled by the <ORGANIZATION> CTM </ORGANIZATION>, then authorized <PERSON> Morales </PERSON> as union leader. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said the agreement was a victory for <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>, but he did not elaborate. The strike closed 15 plants, idled 2,000 workers and cost the plants about $ 500,000 a day in lost production. Tamaulipas Gov. <PERSON> Americo </PERSON> <PERSON> Villareal </PERSON> held a marathon round of meetings with plant managers, rival union factions and business leaders Thursday and Friday before resolving the stalemate. `` The governor of the state of <LOCATION> Tamaulipas </LOCATION> deserves alot of credit,'' <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said in a telephone interview `` He said enough of this corruption. He took a very positive stand and negotiated this.'' The <ORGANIZATION> CTM </ORGANIZATION> is the nation's largest and most-powerful labor organization and is a pillar of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. At least 800 workers of the 2,000 affected by the strike rebelled against <PERSON> Morales </PERSON> on Tuesday, ripping down the strike flags, returning to work and locking themselves inside their plants. Plant managers had refused to sign contracts with <PERSON> Morales </PERSON>, whom they accuse of corruption. At least two plants have threatened to pull out of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. `` <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industries that have projects planned have put them on hold and are watching the situation very closely,'' <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> McAllen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said earlier. In <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, a private business group in <LOCATION> Monterrey </LOCATION>, called on President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> to intervene before the strike discouraged new investment. `` This conflict is affecting <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s image and putting in risk the consideration of foriegn investors who bring their capital to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>, the council's director general, said in a statement. The manager of one plant said <PERSON> Morales </PERSON> forces companies to give the <ORGANIZATION> CTM </ORGANIZATION> control of trucking contracts, transportation of waste and even food coupons so that workers have to buy food from stores he controls. The workers say they have no obligation under Mexican labor law to sign with the <ORGANIZATION> CTM </ORGANIZATION> and, in fact, are happy with <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> no matter who he represents. The foreign-owned maquiladora plants take advantage of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s lower labor costs to assemble products for export to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> The maquiladora industry is a key source of jobs and investment for <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Disney President Makes $74 Million on Stock Deal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BURBANK, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The president and chief operating officer of <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> made a $ 74.2 million profit in July by selling shares he purchased six months earlier under the company's stock option plan. The sale by <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>, revealed in a filing with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, was done in part because <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> `` wanted to do some estate planning,'' <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Erwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Okun </PERSON> said Friday. `` He has no plans to leave,'' <PERSON> Okun </PERSON> said. `` He's highly optimistic about the long-range prospects, and he recently signed a contract through 1994.'' <PERSON> Okun </PERSON> said <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> made a cash purchase of 850,000 <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> shares at the option exercise price of $ 14.36 each in January for a total of $ 12.2 million. <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> sold the shares on July 18 and July 19 at a market price of $ 101.60, or $ 86.4 million. Under the program, he still holds options to buy 42,000 shares at the same low $ 14.36. That's the amount, adjusted for a stock split, the shares were selling for when he joined the company in September 1984. <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>' salary this year is $ 400,000, and he received a $ 3.7 million bonus in January, an amount determined by the company's net income. And there's more. `` In November he gets options on another 369,000 shares under his contract -LRB- at the same $ 14.36 -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Okun </PERSON> said. Last year, <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>' boss, <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> chairman and chief executive officer <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisner </PERSON>, was paid a salary of $ 750,000 and his performance-based bonus was $ 6.8 million. But he made a $ 32.6 million profit on shares purchased and sold under the option program, and <PERSON> Okun </PERSON> said he has the option of buying 948,143 shares at the low rate. If he exercised the the option and could sell the shares at Friday's stock price, he would pocket more than $ 92 million. The year <PERSON> Eisner </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> signed on with <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>, the company earned $ 97.2 million. In the fiscal year that ended Sept. 31, the earnings had jumped to $ 522 million.
