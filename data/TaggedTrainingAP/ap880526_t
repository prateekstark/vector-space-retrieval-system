 Striking TV and movie scriptwriters claimed they had split management ranks Thursday after 64 producers, including the makers of `` The Cosby Show'' and <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Carson </PERSON>'s talk show, signed independent contracts with the writers' union. Several of the firms that signed with the <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> produce successful television programs for <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Producers </ORGANIZATION>, representing the industry's biggest producers, downplayed the signings, which represent a significant break in the 12-week strike. The walkout has forced delays in the start of the fall television season and reruns of such shows as `` Late Night with <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON>'' and `` The Tonight Show starring <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Carson </PERSON>.'' The 9,000-member <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> was scheduled to vote Thursday night in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> on contracts with smaller, so-called independent producers. Voting results would n't be known until Friday, said union spokeswoman <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` We're anticipating ratification,'' Ms. <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON> said. `` We see it strategically as a good move at this time to break the logjam with the alliance.'' Ms. <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON> released the names of the independent producers and the terms of their three-year contract with the <ORGANIZATION> WGA </ORGANIZATION> before members gathered to vote on the proposal. The contract includes increases in foreign residual payments and provides writers with greater creative input. The list of 64 production companies includes the <ORGANIZATION> Carsey-Werner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>, which produces two of the most popular shows on television, `` The Cosby Show'' and `` A Different World.'' The makers of `` Tonight'' signed a contract and the producers of `` Late Night'' have agreed to a contract but have n't signed, said union President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirgo </PERSON>. Others signing were producers of `` Alf'' and `` The Muppets.'' Also on the list are <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Landon </PERSON> <PERSON> Productions </PERSON>, which makes `` Highway to Heaven'' and You and Me Kid Productions, the maker of the now-cancelled `` The Days and Nights of <PERSON> Molly </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>.'' Most of the producers appear to be film companies, such as <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gaby </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, and some, such as <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Keyes </PERSON> Productions, produce TV specials. None of the 217 big producers who belong to the alliance have signed independent contracts, management spokesman <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> said Thursday. The large producers, whose ranks include such big-time moviemakers as <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> and such TV giants as <ORGANIZATION> MTM </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON>, employ 80 percent of the industry's writers and supply 84 percent of prime-time TV, he noted. `` The alliance producers are holding strong,'' <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> said. `` This is all very, very interesting, but it has no impact on the new season or on the contract negotiations,'' <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> said. `` What they're talking about makes no change in the point of conflict, which are the deficits for productions of one-hour prime-time TV shows and the depressed market for those shows in syndication.'' Nearly 180 producers had discussed independent agreements, which meet the writers' demands on residual payments they receive when shows are rerun and for consultation on script changes made during filming, she said. Those are the main points of contention in the strike, which began March 7. On Monday, both sides sat down with a federal mediator for the first time since April 8. The talks at alliance headquarters in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Sherman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oaks </LOCATION> failed to produce agreement on any issue. Negotiators agreed to meet in small groups Saturday and set another full bargaining session Tuesday.

 A friend and ex-roommate of <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dann </PERSON>, the woman who fatally shot a child and wounded six people, was charged with making harassing telephone calls and committed to a psychiatric ward, police said Thursday. <PERSON> Sheri </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, 34, of suburban <ORGANIZATION> Highwood </ORGANIZATION> was arrested late Wednesday by members of a county task force investigating last Friday's shootings by Ms. <PERSON> Dann </PERSON>, said <ORGANIZATION> Winnetka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Timm </PERSON>. `` We are in the process of determining the extent of Ms. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>'s involvement with <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dann </PERSON>,'' who killed herself after the shootings, <PERSON> Timm </PERSON> said at a news conference. Investigators want to know if Ms. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> was recently in contact with Ms. <PERSON> Dann </PERSON> or involved in her violent rampage in this affluent suburb north of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, said Assistant State's Attorney <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> is accused of threatening the life of her ex-husband, <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, and their children, who live with their father, <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> and <PERSON> Timm </PERSON> said. She also was arrested for failing to appear on a drunken driving charge in <LOCATION> Evanston </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said authorities were alarmed to discover Ms. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> had a valid <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> firearms ownership card and had purchased a .357 - caliber Magnum pistol within the past The gun was found during a police search of her apartment, he said. <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said Ms. <PERSON> Dann </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> had been roommates about a year ago. After her arrest, <PERSON> Timm </PERSON> said, the woman was involuntarily committed to a psychiatric unit at Rush-Presbyterian-St. <PERSON> Luke </PERSON>'s Medical Center in Last Friday, Ms. <PERSON> Dann </PERSON> started a small fire in a home, shot six children at <ORGANIZATION> Hubbard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Woods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, killing one, and then shot and wounded a 20-year-old man at a nearby house, where she later shot and killed herself. Ms. <PERSON> Dann </PERSON> also sent or delivered about two dozen packages of snacks and juice laced with arsenic to acquaintances. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday that Ms. <PERSON> Dann </PERSON> apparently acted alone in sending the poisoned food and drinks. `` Nobody else has surfaced as an accomplice,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinmetz </PERSON>, supervisor of the Madison office of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, where Ms. <PERSON> Dann </PERSON> obtained the poison. At <LOCATION> Evanston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, shooting victim 8-year-old <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Teborek </PERSON> was released Thursday while another victim, <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>, 8, was upgraded to fair condition. <PERSON> Kathryn </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, 7, and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Trossman </PERSON>, 6, were in good condition.

 Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> said Thursday that talks with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> about his future broke down when the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> envoy presented him with an ultimatum that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> terms be accepted immediately. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, speaking to a cheering crowd that packed the 500-seat National Assembly, accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of `` political, economic and military'' aggression against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. `` The world must know that the conversation sustained with the envoy of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> broke down when he presented us with an ultimatum in which <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> had to immediately accept his last offer,'' said <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who as head of the 15,000-member military is the de facto leader of the country. `` I know it and I say so because I was there. -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State -RRB- <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> was n't there,'' he told the crowd. Hundreds more listened outside near a loudspeaker. The general did not elaborate. He said <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> had accepted several <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposals, but added: `` Even this was n't sufficient. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> desired an ultimatum.'' In <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Vinicio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cerezo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arevalo </PERSON> offered Thursday to act as mediator between the two countries. He told reporters <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> was experiencing `` a radicalization against the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that is dangerous for the region and that moreover is causing grave damage to the Panamanian nation.'' The Guatemalan chief executive said he had spoken with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Panamanian officials on the issue. He did not identify them. <ORGANIZATION> Cerezo </ORGANIZATION> met Thursday with <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> appeared in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> to answer questions about what the government insists were `` conversations,'' not negotiations, on a possible arrangement under which he would leave power. The speech was attended by 39 of the assembly's 67 members. Those absent included the 20 representatives of opposition parties. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> had become a pawn for candidates in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> political campaign. They `` are using the flag of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in whatever way is convenient for them'' and some candidates want `` to bury files that weigh on their shoulders,'' said <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who commands <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s military and police He did not identify them. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> repeated his conditions for leaving power: Extra troops sent to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> must be withdrawn and the position of <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON>, whom he installed as president, must be guaranteed. He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` must respect <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>.'' `` I refer the North American people and their candidates who are using the flag of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to win votes to the words of one of their philosophers, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON>, when he said the politician thinks of the next elections, the statesman of the next generations,'' the general said. Referring to the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> treaties of 1977, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> said: `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has mocked what has been signed. It has mocked the signing of the Torrijos-Carter treaties.'' Gen. <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Torrijos </PERSON>, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s predecessor and mentor, reached the accord with President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> wants <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who is under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> indictment on drug charges, to leave the country and <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> to return as president in exchange for lifting economic sanctions and possibly dropping the drug charges. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> dismissed <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> on Feb. 26, the day after <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> had tried to fire the general as commander of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> Defense Forces. <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON> told a women's organization earlier Thursday that American negotiators told <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> in March to be out of the country within 48 hours or face the consequences. After <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> refused, he said, the Americans softened their manner. He said talks failed because the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would not promise to keep him on as president or to help with <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s economic crisis, which stems partly from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sanctions. The final deal would have dropped the drug charges in return for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> giving up command of the armed forces Aug. 12 and leaving the country in September, <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON> said, but added: `` When we talked to them about the need for them to give guarantees and proofs that they would look for ways to recover in part the economic damage caused to the Republic of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> they came back with promises but never followed through.'' According to <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would promise to release $ 50 million in Panamanian assets frozen in American banks only if he chose a national unity Cabinet that in turn would pick a president `` who could not be <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON>, president of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, said Thursday the negotiations failed because of a growing division in the military and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should have been aware of it. `` Errors by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> were not the only factor although they were a factor,'' he said.

 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> lashed out Wednesday at political liberals, accusing them of destroying a bipartisan consensus toward the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, while Democratic presidential front-runner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s advocacy of the death penalty for drug dealers was `` the height of hypocrisy.'' During a one-hour debate in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> pressed his Democratic rival for specific budget details as well as on his policy toward <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. But the two Democrats saved their strongest comments for criticism of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration for its dealings with <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> military leader <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. After the debate, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> met privately. With President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> en route to a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit, the two Democrats said they hoped the superpowers would move toward less reliance on military solutions to world problems. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said the superpowers were `` wandering around the world like lonesome cowboys'' intervening militarily. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he wished <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` godspeed and a good astrologist, as he believes in both'' and added he hoped the superpowers would `` look beyond the arms race.'' The debate _ their first in more than a month _ took place only hours after Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> announced the failure of negotiations aimed at getting <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to relinquish power in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said no new talks were scheduled. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the fact the negotiations had broken down `` does n't depress me. `` I'm convinced <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> will be out of power,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> Lakehurst </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> `` We'll have to go back and figure it out.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has advocated the death penalty for drug kingpins. When <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was asked if he supported that position, he replied, `` I do not. I do not think we have the moral authority to execute in that sense. We have the obligation to take them off the streets and above all, do not deal with them and give them sanctuary and put them on the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> payroll.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> then interjected, `` It's the height of hypocrisy for people in the administration to be advocating the death penalty for drug pushers while they are doing business with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and funneling aid to the Contras through convicted drug dealers. `` I do n't know of anything phonier than that kind of policy.'' Questioned about his opposition to the death penalty, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, `` You do n't have to be for the death penalty to be tough on crime.'' He said views on the death penalty would not be a standard for judges he would appoint as president. `` I do n't apply ideological litmus tests,'' he said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said trying to forumlate a detailed budget plan so far in advance would be `` a serious mistake.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> kept pressing him, however, saying that `` the governor is laying out a budget of prommises but not a budget of numbers.'' When <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> if he would use military force against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor replied that he would press for more effective sanctions. When <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> kept pressing him, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, `` Yes, one aspect of a tough anti-terrorist policy is the use of military force against terrorist base camps. But there are many ways to attack terrorism.'' The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor expects to lock up the Democratic presidential nomination on June 7, when <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> hold primaries, the last major contests of the long pre-convention campaign. During a stop at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Capitol before he flew west, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> picked up endorsements from 18 members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> who will be `` super delegates'' to the Democratic National Convention in July. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, at <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, told cadets at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> commencement ceremony that the `` liberal elite'' had abandoned what he called the bipartisan consensus for maintaining a strong national defense. Aides billed the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> speech as non-political. Standing under a small canopy in the pouring rain, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> never mentioned <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> or <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, but left no doubt of his targets. `` I'm sure they'd claim it is n't so and they're all in favor of a strong defense,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` They look the part, sober and measured in their gray suits, moving their hands on the Sunday talk shows with just the right amount of gravity and earnestness.'' `` But what are we to think, when they say they're for a strong defense but they oppose every new weapons system that would preserve that strength?'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> asked. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spoke only hours after President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> departed for <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and a superpower summit in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. He cautioned against allowing summit meetings to lead toward complacency toward the Soviets. `` We must be confident that those who will lead our country understand what it means to stand up to a challenge and meet our commitments,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` We must be confident that they will pursue negotiations with the Soviets realistically.'' He said that under <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> presidents <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and then under <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> there was bipartisan agreement on the need to deal with the Soviets from a position of strength. `` There are some today who have abandoned those principles,'' he said. `` The liberal elite do not understand _ they never understood _ the common sense behind the consensus.'' Later, the vice president called for the naming of an independent counsel to study recent alleged financial irregularties surrounding <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. `` If they want to talk about -LRB- Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, how about talking about the speaker?'' he said. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s legal problems have been frequently raised by the Democrats. While in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> met with a former rival, Democratic Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, a private meeting he later described as `` very cordial.'' They met in <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' hotel room and <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> still withheld any endorsement of the apparent nominee. The senator wrote to his delegates last week and urged them to stay loyal for the time being. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> has nearly 400 delegates. The 18 congressional delegates <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> picked up moved his total to nearly 1,700. He needs 2,081 for a convention majority. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has less than 1,000 in the latest <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> survey. During meetings at the Capitol, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, `` We are not going to concede one single state to the Republicans in the fall.'' One of his sessions was with Western members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and he said, `` The strategy is to win the West.'' He said it was `` one of the great political paradoxes'' that while Democrats run well in the region in contests for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, governor and other offices, the party's candidates have been virtually shut out there in recent presidential elections. The last Democratic presidential candidate to carry the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> was <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> in 1964.

<TEXT>
 After a boldly existential ending, `` St. Elsewhere'' exists no more. The show, which won a dozen Emmy Awards, concluded Wednesday night with a surprise conclusion revealing the entire six years of the critically acclaimed series as the fantasy of an autistic child. `` We've had the ending for a number of years,'' said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Paltrow </PERSON>, one of the show's executive producers. `` We were looking for the metaphor for all of us to have created this fiction. To place the entire six years into the imagination of boy who could not communicate with the outside world, but had this staggeringly exciting inner life was we thought an excitingly existential end to the series.'' When it made its debut six season ago, `` St. Elsewhere'' was part of a wave of creativity from <ORGANIZATION> MTM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Productions </ORGANIZATION> that revolutionized stodgy network programming in the 1980s. `` St. Elsewhere'' followed `` Hill Street Blues'' onto <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> and was inevitably compared to the earlier show's groundbreaking style, overlapping dialogue and hand-held cameras. But `` St. Elsewhere'' went beyond `` Hill Street'' in social satire. At times serious, at times hilarious, it took on politics, religion, AIDS, heterosexual and homosexual rape, cancer, drug abuse, the afterlife, corporate indifference, its own network and previous shows from <ORGANIZATION> MTM </ORGANIZATION>. One entire episode revolved around a male patient's insistence that he was <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> from `` The <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> Show.'' The `` St. Elsewhere'' writers had wanted to go all out in the final episode, but prohibitive costs kept their script, a futuristic view of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eligius </ORGANIZATION> at the edge of apocalypse, from being filmed. In the end, prohibitive costs knocked down not only the intended final episode but the show itself. `` St. Elsewhere'' was produced at a loss by <ORGANIZATION> MTM </ORGANIZATION> at a time when hour-long series are not selling well in syndication. The show will be seen in reruns, but <ORGANIZATION> MTM </ORGANIZATION> will not release details of its syndication sales. In an apparently personal, inside joke in the dialogue of the final script, Dr. <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Fiscus </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Howie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandel </PERSON> -RRB-, says of his years at <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Eligius </LOCATION>, `` Grueling hours, bad food, egomania, death and moral confusion. It'll be hard to leave.'' The producers of the show have long since left and are busy on a new series for <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, `` Tattinger's,'' an offbeat romantic comedy set in a popular <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> restaurant. It is being shot on location here and stars <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, <PERSON> Blythe </PERSON> <PERSON> Danner </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Stiller </PERSON>. The show is on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s fall schedule in the time period that `` St. Elsewhere'' is leaving.

<HEAD>Senate Republicans Lock Themselves In Room During Tax Hikes</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republicans locked themselves in a room in protest Wednesday night as <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> senators adopted two tax increase measures totaling more than $ 100 million. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> quickly approved a $ 70 million income tax loophole closing measure and a 5 percent sales tax on cigarettes designed to raise nearly $ 40 million and sent the measures to the House. As the vote took place, six <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republicans sat in a locked room with the telephones either in use or off the hook. The Republicans said they were caucusing and were hoping to delay action on the tax increase proposals while at the same time drawing media attention to the tax bills. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, with many Democrats also absent from the chamber, approved the bills on a voice vote. `` For a $ 100 million bill to go through the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> without a roll call is outrageous,'' said Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Locke </PERSON>, who led the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> caucus. <PERSON> Locke </PERSON> and fellow Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Cellucci </PERSON> are top officials in Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> presidential campaign.

<DATELINE>ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Ten years after <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> started its gamble with legalized gaming, it has won a giant new industry but lost its innocence. Even skeptics wo n't deny the resort has seen a dramatic economic turnaround since the first casino opened May 26, 1978, and turned the island into the most visited tourist destination in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The casinos provide year-round jobs, tax benefits for the state's elderly and disabled and a percentage of gaming revenues for rebuilding <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> neighborhoods. But even the most optimistic observer can find flaws in how the `` experiment'' turned out, particularly in the deteriorated neighborhoods and shuttered shop windows just steps from the casino hotel lobbies. Before 1978, the saying was, `` The last one to cross the bridge turns out the lights,'' recalls <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Pasquale </PERSON>. The city was dying. Then, in a honky-tonk burst of flashing lights and ringing bells, <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> was reborn. Hundreds of buses and cars now squeeze down narrow streets each day. Big-name entertainers are returning to the showrooms, and Convention Hall throbs with trade shows, heavyweight fights and other extravaganzas. <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Norton </PERSON>, executive vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Resorts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Casino </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION>, recalls the `` exhilarating rush'' when his casino opened as the city's first legal gaming hall. Thousands of people lined up outside, waiting for a chance to drop quarters into slot machines and slap bills onto green felt. Last year, <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> reported more than $ 2.8 billion in gaming revenues and more than 30 million visitors. Twelve casino hotels tower over the city's <LOCATION> Boardwalk </LOCATION> and the once-barren marina section. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> gaming industry is the focus of high-stakes Wall Street business deals. And with more than 40,000 casino employees, unemployment in the region has declined to record lows. Yet many tourists cluck in dismay at the decaying houses that still line the city's streets _ thoroughfares made famous by the Monopoly game board. The crime rate also causes concern. In 1976, the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Rebuild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> promised that casino gaming would reduce violent crime in the resort. Murders, rapes, assaults and armed robberies actually increased from 10.3 per 1,000 residents in 1977 to a high of 32 in 1981. But when adjusted to account for the millions of visitors and thousands of non-resident employees, the figures settle down to an overall reduced rate. State gaming regulators beam with pride at having kept the casinos relatively free of organized crime's corruption, although some critics feel they wield too much control over the city. Others suggest <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> needs more control _ specifically, a regional or state authority to run city government. The current power struggle among state, county and local officials has delayed two important projects: a proposed new convention center and a larger airport. `` The city itself has not redeveloped as quickly as everyone hoped,'' said Casino Control Commissioner <PERSON> Valerie </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>. `` There was a great deal of optimism in 1976 when the referendum passed that things would move quickly, but it's disappointing to see what is potentially a beautiful city not go anywhere.'' <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> was languishing, the victim of broadening travel horizons made possible by cheaper airfares, when the notion of legalized gaming surfaced as a way to rebuild. A referendum to legalize gambling statewide failed in 1974; a second ballot question, limiting gaming to <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, was approved by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> voters Nov. 2, 1976. The casinos have generally found <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> profitable. But the city never revitalized enough to improve its appearance beyond the casinos. While the suburbs are booming with shopping centers and housing developments, <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> still has no movie theater that is n't pornographic and only one well-worn supermarket Houses on prime waterfront lots are dilapidated, owned mostly by speculators who hoped a decade ago _ and still hope _ to reap huge profits. And what development has taken place has not pleased everyone. The Rev. <PERSON> Dudley </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarfaty </PERSON>, an original member of the `` Casinos: No Dice!'' anti-gambling group, still believes that `` a lot of the local people gambling was supposed to save were driven away.'' Others want to preserve the old <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> of grand seaside hotels, the <ORGANIZATION> Miss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pageant </ORGANIZATION>, Boardwalk rolling chairs and ocean breezes. `` The worst thing to happen to <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> was perhaps the failure to properly plan and protect the <LOCATION> Boardwalk </LOCATION> frontage architecturally so there would have been something other than solid masonry walls,'' said <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> historian <PERSON> Adrian </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>. In a similar vein, former Gov. <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>, who ushered in casino gambling, said <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> needs to focus more attention on becoming an overall resort instead of just a casino town. `` <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> has contributed to the new, exciting image of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> as a state that's not just a turnpike between <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` But <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> needs to become a fun place to visit even if you're not going to a casino.'' Ten years ago, local business owners believed they would profit from the casinos next door. Most did not, primarily because the casinos became self-contained cities. `` Competitors in the wagering business argued that it was n't safe for people to visit <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Norton </PERSON> of Resorts `` But we found that as long as you could provide a safe, indoor environment, we could create whatever atmosphere we wanted inside.'' Despite the competition, some local businesses survived. <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Orsatti </PERSON>, a restaurateur, said he discovered `` there's room for everybody.'' `` There are too many people who think negatively,'' he said. `` We're doing very well. A lot of the big spenders would rather go outside of the casino than wait in line.'' <PERSON> Cora </PERSON> <PERSON> Boggs </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organizations </ORGANIZATION>, recalled that `` too many people in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, including myself, were resentful for a long while of the casinos because we could n't see anything else happening.'' But now that funds from the <ORGANIZATION> Casino </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reinvestment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> are beginning to rebuild beleaguered neighborhoods, Mrs. <PERSON> Boggs </PERSON> said, `` The attitude is changing.'' Former Mayor <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lazarow </PERSON> helped push through the gambling proposal. `` I'm proud of what I've done,'' <PERSON> Lazarow </PERSON> said. `` There's a lot more opportunity here now, a lot of decent jobs. Maybe they're not all the best in the world, but a family can make a living here now. `` I think we revived a fast-dying city.''

<TEXT>
 The first McDonald's to open in a communist country has run into an unexpected problem: Trained employees are quitting because they find they have to work like Westerners and get paid like east Europeans. Since the American fast food chain opened its outlet in <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> in March, 40 employees _ about one-third of its workers _ have voluntarily left their jobs despite a high unemployment rate in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Predrag </PERSON> <PERSON> Dostanic </PERSON>, managing director of the restaurant, blames illusions about the West gleaned from <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> movies shown on Yugoslav TV for the dropout rate. `` That is all a result of a drastically incorrect concept about international businesses, implanted in people's minds by such American TV series as ` Dynasty,''' <PERSON> Dostanic </PERSON> said. `` Those who have left us thought they would earn high wages only by virtue of working for an American enterprise,'' said <PERSON> Vesna </PERSON> <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>, an official of <ORGANIZATION> Genex </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Yugoslav </LOCATION> state enterprise that entered into a joint venture agreement with <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>. `` Those young people who quit probably also expected they could do their jobs the Yugoslav way _ relax at work but still receive wages,'' <PERSON> Dostanic </PERSON> added. According to a recent domestic survey, average Yugoslavs work efficiently for only half of their eight-hour workday. The rest of the time is spent reading newspapers, conducting private business or having interminable private chats with collegues over coffee. The fast-food outlet, located on a downtown square, has drawn huge crowds since it opened March 23 to post a European record for <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> restaurants by selling an average 6,000 meals daily for the first month of operation. The only other European branch matching the <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> record is the McDonald's in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, which opened a month after the Yugoslav outlet. With demand growing fast, it is serving about 6,000 people a day. Employees are so overworked that store manager <PERSON> Agnes </PERSON> <PERSON> Rapalics </PERSON> decided the only way to cope was to close at 8 p.m., three hours early. Her decision swiftly prompted moans from Hungarians, including a sour reader who wrote to the <ORGANIZATION> Magyar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hirlap </ORGANIZATION> newspaper asking, `` Does every wonder only last three days?'' When the <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> restaurant opened in <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION>, police were called in to keep watch on the lines of customers snaking around the bloc and to limit the number of people entering the premises to avoid overcrowding. `` The work was so hard that I could not stand it any more,'' said a former employee, who asked not to be identified. `` If my salary was adequate to the work, I might have stayed.'' The restaurant employees, mostly young people trained to work on counters and in the kitchen, receive about $ 170 a month, which is slightly above the Yugoslav average. `` We have no problem replacing those who have quit with new staff, except that the newcomers have to get their training while doing their work,'' said <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>. About 1.1 million people, or about 15 percent of the work force, are registered as unemployed in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> alone, about 80,000 are looking for jobs. `` Maybe there is something good in all these unexpected staff problems,'' said <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>. `` Only the best workers will survive,'' she added. <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Genex </ORGANIZATION> contributed $ 1 million each for the flagship restaurant. They also share the profits equally, even though it is managed by Yugoslavs. The American corporation plans to open five more restaurants in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> in the next five years.

 Images of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> dancing to rock music in a <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> commercial flicker across the Soviet television screen, and <PERSON> Levi </PERSON>'s jeans hug the hips of young Russians in a crowded subway car. Amerika, as the Soviets call it, has arrived. `` Far behind the Iron Curtain, we were able to develop a pro-Western mentality, and what, tell me, could be more Western than <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>?'' emigre author <PERSON> Vasily </PERSON> <PERSON> Aksyonov </PERSON> wrote about his youth in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> of the 1950s. Even the Cyrillic alphabet has n't prevented what the Russians call <LOCATION> Amerikanizatsia </LOCATION>. `` Jeansi,'' `` stop,'' `` break dance,'' `` OK'' and one of the latest signs of the times _ `` stress'' _ are now part of the Russian lexicon. Soviet Communist Party General Secretary <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has encouraged his people to learn more about <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. To demonstrate his sincerity, he has allowed more travel to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, ended the jamming of <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> broadcasts and removed barriers to joint business deals. In April, a record 1,200 Soviets, most of them Jews, were allowed to visit relatives in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. An additional 1,000 Soviets traveled there on official business. Before <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, only a handful of Soviets visited the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> monthly. The 1985 <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> summit gave an official stamp of approval to cultural agreements and `` people-to-people'' exchanges. Under the agreements, Soviet and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> lawyers, doctors, students, musicians, scientists and teachers have visited each other. In some instances, the exchanges reflect a Soviet desire for American help in tackling social problems such as alcoholism and drug addiction, problems the government previously denied existed. At the grass-roots level, Soviets need little encouragement to talk about things American. When introduced to an American, many Soviets immediately start with the questions, on everything from war and peace to the availability of hamburgers. A taxi driver's reaction when a passenger introduced himself as an American was to run down the American authors she loved _ <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Hemingway </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Twain </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradbury </PERSON>. Collections of these authors in translation occupy prominent places on the bookshelves in some Soviet apartments. More contemporary American authors are lesser known because their works still are n't available in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Levi </PERSON>'s jeans are required attire in certain circles. And some of those who manage to get an American candy bar, soft drink or pack of cigarettes proudly display the empty packaging in their living rooms. Many Soviets are turning to videotapes for a glimpse of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Tapes of movies such as `` Police Academy'' and `` Rambo,'' dubbed in Russian, are passed among friends in a thriving black market where blank cassettes cost at least 50 rubles -LRB- $ 80 -RRB-, or one quarter of an average monthly salary. The black market also feeds on young Soviets' thirst for American rock music. Records of <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> fetch exorbitant sums. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s music videos have appeared on Soviet television, and his <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> commercials hit the airwaves in mid-May during broadcast of a five-part series on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Officially sponsored concerts by American musicians such as <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Joel </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Brubeck </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Doobie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> have become major happenings. At the same time, some Soviet rock stars are traveling to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Grebenshchikov </PERSON>, the hippy-like leader of the <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> rock band Aquarium, is scheduled to record an album in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> this summer. The end of Soviet jamming of Voice of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> broadcasts in May 1987 opened a new source of information about life in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Satellite television discussions with American studio audiences also have given Soviets a chance to learn first-hand about life in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Soviet television's widely watched evening news program `` Vremya'' has shown features on child care, automobiles and sports in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, and in mid-May Soviet television broadcast a series moderated by former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> resident <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Posner </PERSON>. But even though Soviet media coverage about the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has become more balanced under <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, reports about crime, unemployment, racism and the poor are still common. In politics, Americans and Soviets still have sharp differences. But for many of the Soviets who viewed <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as a warmonger a few years ago the rhetoric has eased since he signed an agreement with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> last December to eliminate all medium-range nuclear missiles. `` We have no propaganda of hatred toward Americans, no disrespect of Americans,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told a group of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> teachers of Russian who met with him at the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> last August. `` One can not find them here, either in politics or in teaching.''

 It's been more than 300 years since this town saw so much struggle over restraint, but Plimoth Plantation visitors could soon be drinking beer and wine after a brief spell of temperance at the tourist spot. For a while, it looked like the prudish reputation of those early settlers had come back to haunt the village, which offers a glimpse of 17th century life after <LOCATION> Plymouth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>. But Tuesday night, after several go-rounds, the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Selectmen </ORGANIZATION> approved a limited liquor license for the plantation. The board twice rejected requests for a license to serve all types of liquor year-round or for one-day licenses. The license approved Tuesday applies only from April to November, when the plantation visitor center is open. It still requires state approval. The 41-year-old private, non-profit tourist spot first served alcohol four years ago at a snack bar. But that license was discontinued when the snack bar was torn down. With the opening of a new visitors center and 200-seat restaurant, the plantation management hoped to draw more business by opening in the off-hours for business conferences, during which guests would expect alcohol on the menu. In the past, some residents objected that alcohol was not in keeping with the Pilgrim spirit. But in fact, the Pilgrims cooked with wine and regarded beer as more healthful than water, plantation officials said. However, plantation spokeswoman <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> said most of the arguments against a comprehensive liquor license came from nearby restaurants and bars.

 The state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> agreed with the saying, `` you ca n't take it with you,'' and approved a bill that would allow elderly lottery winners to receive their jackpots sooner than younger winners. The bill approved Wednesday and sent to the Assembly would allow jackpot winners older than age 65 to take their earnings in one lump sum or in periodic payments during their expected lifetime. `` The usual 20-year payoff on a lottery prize will not always result in a total benefit to the winner who is over 65, as he may not live to receive the full benefit,'' said a memo on the bill. `` The fact that the unpaid balance would be paid to his estate is of little consolation to many elderly winners who may wish to fully enjoy the fruits of their good fortune,'' it said. But <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON>, director of the state Lottery Division, said he opposes the bill because it would substantially reduce jackpots. For example, he said, the jackpot up for grabs Wednesday was $ 3 million, but `` I do n't have $ 3 million to give them, I have $ 1.4 million. The difference is interest money.'' A winner currently would receive 21 annual payments of $ 114,000 after taxes, said <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON>. If someone opted to take the prize in a $ 1.4 million lump sum, they would owe about $ 580,000 in taxes, he said. <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> said he did n't believe any state lotteries offer the lump-sum option. The average million-dollar lottery winner in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> is 49 years old, said <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON>.

 There are no traffic lights in all of peaceful <LOCATION> Trinity </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> _ and it's going to stay that way, despite a state suggestion one is needed near a proposed shopping center.

 A leopard owned by a rock singer who uses animals in his nightclub act escaped from its cage Wednesday and killed the entertainer's 2-year-old daughter, officials said. Five leopards escaped from <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>'s home on 200 acres near <LOCATION> Ashland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, but all were captured by Wednesday night, said police Lt. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmore </PERSON>. <PERSON> Nikka </PERSON> <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>, mauled in her family's front yard, died at <ORGANIZATION> Vanderbilt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> as a result of blood loss and massive injuries to her head and neck, said hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>. The leopard involved in the attack was tranquilized by wildlife officials, and died while being transported away, <ORGANIZATION> Metro </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> police said. Savage, who performs heavy metal rock music in leather and wild make-up, uses the leopards in his nightclub act. Savage was in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, but police said he was on his way back to <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> after being informed of the attack.

 If the white satellite dishes pointing west from the Rossiya Hotel past the Kremlin's ancient church domes did n't indicate something unusual was going on, the new paint and pavement along Vorovsky Street might <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> is being inundated with <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> officials and Western correspondents bringing the latest technology to cover President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s five-day visit, beginning Sunday. And in age-old tradition, officials are painting, paving and otherwise sprucing up to ensure that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and those accompanying him get the best possible view of the Soviet capital. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> left <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Wednesday for a three-night stopover in <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, before flying to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for his summit with <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. He comes to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> at a time when the city traditionally is trying to right itself after another long, cold winter. The truck traffic that roars along the Garden Ring Road slows to a crawl as workers fill another spring crop of potholes, and scaffolding goes up on buildings everywhere. Red tulips planted in squares and along boulevards are in bloom, as are the lilacs bordering sidewalks and apartment buildings around the city. Stately chestnut trees are in bloom on the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> lawns. The sun rises about 5 a.m. and does n't set until almost 10 p.m., leaving a purple glow in the sky until almost midnight. But this year the spring cleaning has taken on a particularly urgent air around several of the places <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will visit. The short street leading from the Garden Ring Road to <ORGANIZATION> Spaso </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador's residence where <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will stay, has been repaired for the first time in years. Pavement torn out months ago has been replaced, and almost all the barricades that narrowed traffic for two blocks have been removed. Vorovsky Street also is undergoing a major facelift. Nearly every building along the street from the <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, which <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is scheduled to visit, to the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> building several blocks away appears to have been given a new coat of paint. The Foreign Ministry press center, where <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s most important press conferences are held, has been undergoing repairs for weeks to improve the seats and the acoustics. Officials promised last week that it would be finished in time for the summit, and a pre-summit news conference was held there this week. When a reporter asked one of the speakers for a specific example of changes wrought by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms, however, the microphones and armchair earphones installed for simultaneous translation suddenly failed, forcing a premature end to the session. The <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency said newspapers and magazines from around the world will be available at the press center next week, not just the usual selection of papers from the Soviet bloc. At the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, some last-minute painting was going on, and workers cleared out the courtyard in front of the empty chancery in the new red-brick compound. The building has been the source of dispute between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> since <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials discovered that it was honeycombed with Soviet listening devices. It never has been put into use. At stores, Soviet citizens said they had noticed no increases in supplies to cut down on the lines that gather in the streets. One young woman joked that closer to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s arrival, `` maybe they'll even bring out sugar'' which has been in short supply in the capital and rationed elsewhere in the country because of moonshining, hoarding and price increase <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said in an interview with the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Vechernaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moskva </ORGANIZATION> that about 3,000 foreign journalists are expected for the summit, half from print media and half from radio and television. <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> could not handle the demands of the Western television companies, so they wre permitted to bring in satellite dishes and other sophisticated equipment normally under strict government control. The American television networks have crammed room after room of the mammoth Rossiya Hotel with shiny silver equipment cases, preparing to broadcast their evening news programs from the Soviet capital. With some 5,000 Soviet and foreign journalists accredited to cover the event, the summit press corps is the largest to gather here since the 1980 Olympics, Soviet officials say. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> dissidents say they have noticed another similarity between the two events: Many deemed `` undesirable'' by the authorities were forced to leave town. Eight years ago, they included prostitutes, speculators and other criminals, as well as dissidents. Father <PERSON> Valery </PERSON> <PERSON> Lapkovsky </PERSON>, a Russian Orthodox priest from the Crimean city of <LOCATION> Kerch </LOCATION>, arrived in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> last Friday and was told by authorities the next day to leave, said Russian Orthodox activist <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Ogorodnikov </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lapkovsky </PERSON> was put into a mental hospital and diagnosed as schizophrenic in 1966 after approaching the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy with an appeal to then-President <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> to help him leave the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Soviet officials also have set up roadblocks at the edge of the city to inspect automobiles. The aim is to keep down the number of broken-down cars on the streets of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> visit.

<HEAD>High School Dropout Ends Up As Valedictorian</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WHEATON, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A high school dropout who saw two of her sons quit school as teen-agers has graduated from college with straight A's. <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, 43, of <LOCATION> Wheaton </LOCATION>, earned a perfect 4.0 grade average and was valedictorian at Tuesday's commencement for the <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> at the University of <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>. `` I ca n't come down yet. It's the highest point of my life so far,'' she said Wednesday. She had quit high school at age 16 to get married and have a family. Years later, she earned a high school equivalency degree. Mrs. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> had worked as a teacher's aide and secretary before deciding it was n't too late to try for a college degree in elementary education. She received an associate's degree after attending night classes at <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Rockville </LOCATION> for three years. `` When I went to the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION>, I won a $ 5,000 scholarship and all these wonderful things started happening,'' she said. `` It's been fabulous.'' In her graduation address, she thanked her fellow students for including her in activities and treating her as one of them. `` They'd say, ` Come on, <PERSON> Janet </PERSON>, we're going to have something to eat together.' They wanted me to go. That felt good. They did n't make me feel different. Her two older children, ages 25 and 26, dropped out of high school but also received high school equivalency degrees. Her third son is 15. Her husband retired with a disability after working as a firefighter. She also has a young grandchild. `` It was a struggle without my income for the past two years, but we said, ` We can do it' and we did,'' she said. `` It was hard especially with the family. There were things I could n't do for the children that I wanted to.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> hopes her scholastic success will motivate her youngest son to try harder in school. `` It did seem to have an effect on him. I really want him to continue his education,'' she said. Mrs. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> has a contract with the <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> school system to teach in an elementary school this fall. She is now working as a substitute teacher at Head Start. `` I put a lot of effort into it, and worked a little harder,'' she said. `` Being a little bit older and just living, you learn. And I did n't have to worry about toga parties and sororities.''

<HEAD>WASHINGTON WIRE: Eisenhower Like Reagan Sought Arms Pact as Final
Legacy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The president, nearing the end of his eight years in office, hoped to leave an arms accord as his final legacy after a summit meeting with the leader of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The Soviet leader, under attack by conservatives in his own country for reforms he was attempting, responded sharply to what he described as confrontational statements from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The year was 1960. The president was <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON>. The Soviet leader was <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON>. The summit ended in failure. There are some obvious differences between that summit and next week's meeting between President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. What wrecked the 1960 summit, or at least contributed to its collapse, was the furor that arose after an American U-2 spy plane was forced down in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and its pilot was captured. There is nothing like that on the horizon now, although the Soviets are as adamant against <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s Star Wars missile defense system as they were against <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON>'s `` open skies'' plan to give the superpowers access to each other's air space. Still, the resemblances are haunting. <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON>, hoping for a comprehensive ban on all nuclear testing, told French President <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaulle </PERSON>, `` What a splendid exit it would be for me to end up ... with an agreement between East and West.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> hopes for a pact by the end of his term to curb the intercontinental ballistic missiles that have flourished since <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON>'s day. <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON>, who had unmasked the excesses of <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> in his landmark `` secret speech,'' was making modest economic and political reforms in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and urging dialogue with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Similarly, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has pushed his policies of `` glasnost,'' or openness, and `` perestroika,'' or reconstruction. `` My father was the first to ` shake' the Soviet bureaucratic society,'' <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON>, told the Yugoslav daily <ORGANIZATION> Vjesnik </ORGANIZATION> in an interview published this month. `` I hope <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> succeeds where my father did not.'' Like <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON>'s, the reforms initiated by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> appear to have encountered resistance from the old guard in the Kremlin. Both Soviet leaders reacted sharply to statements by their <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> counterparts. After <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> acknowledged the U-2 flights, <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> president appeared to be `` boasting arrogantly about what the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> could do and would do'' and demonstrating that the Americans `` did n't give a damn about anyone else, that they would pursue only their selfish goals.'' And when <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> accused the Soviets of continued expansionism abroad and repression at home in a speech in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION><LOCATION> , </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, last month, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> responded, `` We have so far been showing restraint, but if we reciprocate _ and we can do so over a wide range of issues _ the atmosphere in Soviet-American relations can become such that it will make it no longer possible to solve any further issues.'' Some observers have interpreted <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s remarks as a deliberate display of toughness designed for Soviet as well as American audiences. `` Quite possibly there are people around him in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> who do n't like the many concessions he has made to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrov </PERSON>, professor emeritus of international affairs at <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> In 1960, too, some suspected the Soviet leader's blustering was an attempt to bolster his strength at home. Retired Gen. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodpaster </PERSON>, a top aide to <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON>, said, `` I do recall that we thought at the time that he might just be vulnerable because of meeting with <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> and the favorable attitude he had toward <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> and this might have put him in some danger and put him under some pressure in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.'' The arms control issue, as well as the status of <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, had been on the agenda for a four-power summit meeting _ the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> _ in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> on May 16. It broke up in disaster. <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON>, pounding a table so hard he upset a bottle of mineral water, denounced the U-2 flights and `` the lackeys of imperialism.'' He also withdrew his invitation to <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> to visit the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> the following month. <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON>, disappointed in his hopes for an East-West agreement, later said he might have been `` lulled into overconfidence.''

<HEAD>Passenger Jets Came Within 300 Feet Of Each Other</HEAD>

 Investigators are trying to determine why two jetliners flying in opposite directions with 286 people on board were assigned the same altitude, bringing them within 300 feet of colliding head-on over the ocean north of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> confirmed the Monday evening incident, which involved a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> Airbus-300 and an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727. Both pilots said in near-collision reports that they had no time to take evasive action as the two aircraft passed wing tip to wing tip in clear weather about 550 miles north of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> in the so-called <LOCATION> Bermuda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Triangle </LOCATION>. The triangle is a region in the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> where ships and aircraft are reputed to have disappeared since the 1940s. The jets both were believed to be cruising at better than 500 miles an hour with a closing speed of more than 1,000 miles an hour. Neither pilot reported seeing the aircraft until they were about to pass each other. `` It is being investigated as a possible operational error'' by air traffic controllers, <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON> said Wednesday, when the incident was revealed. He said he did not know whether the controllers involved have been removed from directing aircraft, normally the case in such an incident. In addition to the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> investigation, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> has sent a team of investigators to <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> to talk to the controllers involved. <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON> confirmed that both of the jetliners were assigned to 29,000 feet and were under the control of the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION> air traffic control center at the time of the incident. That section of airspace is beyond <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> radar, so separation is maintained by assigning specific altitudes. Normal separation would be at least 1,000 feet vertically between aircraft and possibly more in some areas, according to <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON>. He said that in oceanic airspace where there is no radar tracking planes there also is supposed to be `` substantial'' horizontal separation well beyond the five-mile minimum in radar-controlled airspace. `` These planes should not both have been at 29,000 feet,'' <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON> said. He said the two jetliners had about 300 feet horizontal separation and that `` both aircraft observed each other as they passed.'' The incident involved <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 217, which was southbound from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, with a later stop at <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION>. The plane carried 131 passengers and 10 crew members, according to <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanlon </PERSON>. The other plane was American Flight 902 which was northbound from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION> on a flight to <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 carried 138 passengers and seven crewmembers, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hotard </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. `` We understand it's an operational error by air traffic control. It's our understanding that -LRB- both airplanes -RRB- were assigned to 29,000 feet,'' said <PERSON> Hotard </PERSON> in a telephone interview. <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> is investigating who gave the planes their altitude. Both planes were under <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION> air traffic control's direction, he said Another source, who asked not to be identified by name, said that the incident occurred near where control of planes switches from the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> center in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION> center and the handoff may have resulted in an altitude mixup. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON> said he could not confirm that. Investigators for the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> flew to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION> on Wednesday to interview the controllers and may also speak later to the pilots involved, said spokesman <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopatkiewicz </PERSON>. `` We are investigating the incident. We're looking into it,'' <PERSON> Lopatkiewicz </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 In the end, it seemed almost everybody, ranging from Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to his severest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> critics, was saying the same thing about the administration's proposed deal for <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>: `` Just Say No. Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> opposed it along with 86 members of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON>, a leader of the anti-Noriega forces here, said the plan would enable the `` criminal empire'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> created to survive the temporary exile planned for him. A disgruntled administration official was embittered by the terms the administration was offering for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s departure: `` His mother could have written it,'' he said. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> disagreed. Just when an agreement appeared to be within reach Wednesday, he could not bring himself to approve it. Critics of the plan are delighted but Wednesday's drama, bringing an end to almost a month of intense negotiations, puts the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> back to square one. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials, who all along opposed the lifting of drug smuggling indictments against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, are pleased with the outcome. But there is virtually no prospect that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> will ever be prosecuted. The administration has withdrawn all its proposals from the bargaining table and is left with few ideas on what to do next beyond sounding out <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> democracies on their thoughts. The negotiations ended almost three months to the hour after <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s crisis began with the failed attempt by President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> to fire <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, who was fired himself the next day, remains in hiding, portraying himself as <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s legitimate president but without the means to exercise power and with little hope of being able to do so. In 1903, when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> power in the hemisphere was unquestioned, President <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> arranged for the secession of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and for perpetual <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> control over 10-mile wide `` canal zone.'' Those feats took all of two weeks. While the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was once able to get <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to leave <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, it now is unable to perform a task seemingly much simpler: getting <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to leave <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Privately, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials describe the administration's <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> policy as in a shambles. Coupled with the collapse of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> negotiations is the prospect of disintegration of the Nicaraguan Contras and the consolidation of Sandinista rule. Initially, <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>'s attempt to fire <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> seemed to offer the administration a rare opportunity. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s public opinion had galvanized against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, a general strike against his rule was surprisingly successful and it seemed logical that a judicious display of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pressure would be enough to topple him. To many, the administration was in a position to strike a blow for democracy in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and against an indicted drug dealer and to achieve a badly needed victory in Central America after congressional rejection of more Contra aid. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s base of support seemed limited to a small coterie of allies in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> and isolated segments of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s peasantry But <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> proved to be extraordinarily resilient, sensing correctly that as long as the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> remained loyal, he stayed. He was not about to give up, nor about to repeat the humiliating surrender of his countryman, <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Duran </PERSON>, who scandalized Panamanians in the seventh round of a 1980 fight with <PERSON> Sugar </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> when he walked, head down, to his corner and said `` No mas.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> echoed the spirit of <PERSON> Duran </PERSON>'s famous remark on Wednesday although in a far different context when he discussed the collapse of the talks with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. `` No further negotiations are contemplated,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. `` All proposals addressed during these negotiations have been withdrawn. No offers remain on the table.''

 Two monasteries have been returned to Armenian church officials by the government, the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency said. The official news agency said on Wednesday that Armenian authorities returned to the church the Tateva monastery, built in the 9th century, and the Makaravank monastery, built between the 11th and 13th centuries. The government in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, a southern Soviet republic that borders <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, also returned three mosques to religious officials, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. It quoted Patriarch-Catholicos Vazgen of the Armenian church as saying the return of the facilities was an example of improved church-state relations. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the monasteries had been under state protection for many years, but provided no other details about them.

 <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON> could get back on the air and <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> would have his writers back under agreements both have reached with the striking <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, the union's president said Wednesday as talks resumed in the 12-week-old strike. <PERSON> Carson </PERSON>, whose `` Tonight Show'' resumed production this month when he began writing his own monologue, has signed an independent contract and <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON>, whose `` Late Night'' is still in reruns, has agreed to sign, said Guild President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirgo </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kirgo </PERSON> said he was confident that the union membership would approve the three-year pacts with the producers of the two shows. Guild members were scheduled to vote Thursday night on the independent contracts, which executive director <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Walton </PERSON> said involved 39 companies as of Wednesday afternoon. The start of the fall television season could hang in the balance as the striking scriptwriters and producers conduct last-chance talks. The strike began March 7. <PERSON> Walton </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Producers </ORGANIZATION> said the producers presented several proposals Wednesday, and while the union left some open for discussion, it immediately rejected a new payment structure for one-hour prime-time television shows sold into syndication. The formula would drop a fixed payment schedule and reward writers based on a show's success in syndication. Earlier Wednesday, <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON> issued a tongue-in-cheek statement through <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> saying his manager and lawyer _ and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> _ were negotiating with the Guild. Apparently seriously, though, he said he hoped to be back on the air, with his writers back at their jobs, as early as June 8. `` In the meantime, I am keeping busy with my gardening and phoning my favorite talk-radio programs,'' he joked in the statement. `` Last month, I splurged and treated myself to much-needed liposuction surgery on my hips and thighs.'' `` I talked to <PERSON> David </PERSON> last week,'' said <PERSON> Kirgo </PERSON>. `` He's waiting. He will not go back to work without his writers. We had a long and terrific talk.'' Nearly 100 negotiators, attorneys and onlookers for the striking <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Producers </ORGANIZATION> were on hand at the alliance's Sherman Oaks headquarters for the second mediated session in three days. Alliance spokesman <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> said there had been some `` new thinking'' as a result of Monday's meeting with a mediator. Asked what areas the new thinking included, <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> replied, `` the key issues.'' <PERSON> Kirgo </PERSON> did not share <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>'s enthusiasm over a possible break in the deadlock. `` We were here eight hours Monday and nothing happened,'' he said. Producers are preparing to begin important talks June 15 with the Hollywood craft unions and <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION>, whose contracts expire July 31. If writers are still negotiating by then, talks would have to be scheduled around the other unions' talks. Both sides have suffered from the walkout over creative control on the set and residual payments for both one-hour syndicated television show reruns and works distributed in foreign countries.

<TEXT>
 Six radical leftists complained in lengthy speeches about tight security and harsh jail conditions as they were arraigned on charges of setting off a bomb in the the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Capitol five years ago. `` The security concerns have totally subordinated our legal rights and our human rights,'' defendant <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Berkman </PERSON> said Wednesday. <PERSON> Berkman </PERSON>, a physician who already is serving 12 years for illegal possession of explosives and weapons, then referred to the wall of bulletproof plastic that separated the court from spectators and said, `` There is no legitimate security concern to account for that Plexiglas screen in the courtoom.'' Lead defense counsel <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Tipograph </PERSON> complained that the defendants had been unable to meet privately with lawyers to confer about the case. She also said that the defendants were forced to wear handcuffs and leg irons while meeting with lawyers. She refused to discuss a schedule for pretrial motions until the defendants had a chance to meet and discuss hiring permanent lawyers for the case. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> said that he would make sure the defendants were allowed to meet together and confer without being overheard by jail guards. But <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> said he would not interfere with other security precautions taken against the defendants, who were already in custody on other charges before the indictment was unsealed on May 11. The judge, who gave the defendants 30 days to hire lawyers, expressed frustration with the lengthy speeches. `` We're not going to have a mass meeting,'' <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> said. `` If you want to give vent to your exasperation, I ca n't help that.'' At one point, <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> said: `` I'm getting sick of this.'' Each of the six defendants pleaded innocent to the charges, identifying themselves as `` anti-imperialist'' political prisoners. <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Buck </PERSON>, <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> and <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehorn </PERSON> are charged with conspiring to set off bombs in the Capitol and seven other locations in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> as part of a campaign of `` armed propaganda'' against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign policy. They are charged along with <PERSON> Berkman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Blunk </PERSON>, <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON> and <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>, a fugitive, with malicious destruction of property in connection with the bombings at the Capitol and three military buildings in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in 1983 and 1984. None of the blasts caused any injuries. The Nov. 7, 1983, explosion outside the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> chamber blew the doors off hinges outside the offices of <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democratic Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, damaged five paintings and knocked down a wall. `` I am a political prisoner, not a terrorist,'' said Buck, 40, who faces a life sentence following her conviction in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> earlier this month of participating in two 1981 Brink's armored car robberies that left four people dead. The indictment charges that the defendants are members of a secret communist organization that plotted `` to oppose, obstruct or change the foreign and domestic policies of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government through violent and illegal means.'' Five of the six defendants in court Wednesday already are serving sentences for various federal weapons charges. <PERSON> Whitehorn </PERSON> recently completed a two-year term for making a false statement on a passport application. She is in custody awaiting trial in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> on federal weapons charges. <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> ordered her held without bail after Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> described how <PERSON> Whitehorn </PERSON> hit an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent while resisting arrest in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> in 1985. Outside the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Courthouse, relatives of the defendants issued a statement accusing the goverment of trying to silence dissent. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> are making a spectacle of this case to show what the government will do if you dare to oppose it,'' the group said in a statement. Dr. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Zeller </PERSON>, <PERSON> Berkman </PERSON>'s wife, said the courtroom security was `` an enormous show of power of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government. They are trying to intimidate serious dissent. They are trying to intimidate the defendants.'' <PERSON> Bella </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON> said that she was shocked to learn that her daughter was being held in a psychiatric observation unit at the <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jail </ORGANIZATION>. `` There has never been any question about her mental or emotional stability,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON> said. `` She has always been a model prisoner.'' <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON>, 32, and <PERSON> Blunk </PERSON>, 30, are serving 58-year sentences for possession of 600 pounds of explosives found when they were arrested in <LOCATION> Cherry </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, nearly three years ago. The indictment charged that after each bombing, the defendants claimed credit for the blasts under the names of various groups such as the Armed Resistance Unit, the <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fighting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> and the Red Guerrilla Resistance. The groups also claimed responsibility for bombs set off at four locations in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> between 1983 and 1985, the indictment charged. The blasts were set to protest various <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign policies toward the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Catastrophic Health Insurance Bill Clears Major Congressional
Hurdle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A catastrophic health insurance bill providing the largest expansion of Medicare in the program's 23-year history has cleared a major legislative hurdle. The compromise agreed to late Wednesday by a <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> committee </ORGANIZATION> must win final approval from both chambers, but that is a foregone conclusion given the broad support that the basic measure received last year when it cleared the two houses in different versions. Health and Human Services Secretary <PERSON> Otis </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON> told conference committee members that he will recommend that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> sign the legislation, even though it is considerably more ambitious than the measure proposed by the administration more than a year ago. The basic framework of the legislation has been in place for months: providing protection for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s 31 million Medicare recipients against runaway hospital and prescription drug bills accumulated during acute illnesses. But House and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiators have worked since February to iron out the details. Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, whose <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> shaped the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill, called the compromise `` a landmark piece of legislation ... that will bring peace of mind to millions.'' Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, D-Ill., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> as well as the conference committee, praised <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON> for his protracted role in overcoming some objections within the administration to win presidential support for the <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> expansion `` You are the linchpin who launched us on this crusade,'' <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> told <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON>, a physician and former two-term governor of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> whose first wife died after a long battle against cancer. <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON> made catastrophic health legislation his top priority when he was appointed to head the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> a little more than two years ago and was there when the final compromise was struck. In fact, it was a surprise <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON> maneuver _ dropping his opposition to a respite care provision for home-bound beneficaries _ that removed the last stumbling block to compromise. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> could n't believe his ears when <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON> offered the compromise. `` That's a hell of a deal,'' the Texan exclaimed. Later, he told <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON>: `` You're timing was excellent. You are a great negotiator.'' The big knot that had kept the legislation tied up was loosened last week when a conference committee task force agreed on provisions of a historic outpatient prescription drug benefit. The compromise legislation provides for <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> coverage for hospital stays lasting up to 364 days; a first-day deductible still will be charged. <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> now pays full hospital bills for only 59 days a year. Regarding doctor bills, <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> now pays no more than 80 percent of approved charges, no matter how high they run. Under the catastrophic health provision, <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> will pay 100 percent of allowable fees after an individual has incurred $ 1,320 to $ 1,400 in out-of-pocket expenses. The exact level of that deductible has yet to be determined, along with several other details such as the precise additional premiums that will be assessed to pay for the new program. As for prescription drugs, <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> now covers just a handful of particularly expensive drugs, such as anti-rejection medication for organ transplant patients. Under the expansion, <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> will pay half of drug costs in 1991 after a $ 600 deductible is met, with the government share rising to 60 percent in 1992 and 80 percent in 1993. However, the deductible is expected to rise each year to keep pace with rising drug costs. The drug benefit, and all other additional benefits are to be paid for by additional charges to <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> enrollees. The charges will be a blend of flat monthly premium increases deducted from Social Security checks and an additional, sliding-scale supplemental premium that will be charged to the estimated 40 percent of the elderly with enough income to make them subject to federal income taxes. While the exact premiums have not yet been determined, the additional flat premium will start at about $ 4 a month in 1989, climbing to $ 10.20 in 1993. The so-called supplemental premium is expected to total an additional $ 22 a year for each $ 150 of income tax owed in 1989, climbing to an additional $ 42 a year on each $ 150 of tax liability by 1993. In addition to the main provisions, the bill would add <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> benefits to hospice care and skilled nursing care. It also makes changes in Medicaid to prevent the impoverishment of a spouse when his or her mate must go into a nursing home. It also will require state Medicaid programs to pay all Medicare premiums and deductibles for elderly and disabled people with incomes below the poverty line.

Now, he said, `` I'm 57 and I feel like I'm 27 <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> is about to graduate from the <ORGANIZATION> Vietnam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION>, which was started by the kind of veterans rarely heard from _ well-adjusted, well-off and relatively untroubled by their war experience. `` It's successful vets helping vets who have n't quite made it in the mainstream,'' said the program's 44-year-old president and co-founder, <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Gitelson </PERSON>, who led an infantry platoon in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> in 1966 and 1967 as an Army first lieutenant. Among its founders, board members and staffers are lawyers, investment bankers and executives of every pinstripe. The chairman of the board, <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenlaw </PERSON>, earned a Silver Star in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and is an executive with <ORGANIZATION> MTV </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Gitelson </PERSON>, a former banker and management consultant, started the program six years ago in his apartment. `` We kept each other alive in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, with this enormous buddy network. And now, 20 years later, we're rebuilding a network and helping each other in an economic war, to get into the mainstream,'' he said. Today, in a ceremony at <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> Veterans Plaza here, the non-profit group is celebrating its move to a 10,000-square-foot office, courtesy of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, and the donation of $ 100,000 worth of computer equipment from <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>. About 750 veterans have been placed in jobs through the program, which is a pilot for similiar efforts in other cities, <PERSON> Gitelson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gitelson </PERSON> heads a staff of 24, most of them <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> vets and many who have gone through the program. A placement director, for instance, used to be homeless, living behind an elevator shaft in the south <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>. `` We believe the experience of serving in combat gave people skills, abilities and values that are transferable to the mainstream life,'' <PERSON> Gitelson </PERSON> said. The 57-year-old <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, was in the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> during the Korean War and an <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> platoon sergeant in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> in 1968 and 1969. After 12 years with the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, he started his own business, a parking garage, but was forced to give it up when the rent went too high. Welfare and part-time work came next, and then he saw a television ad for the program. `` It was one of the best things I ever did,'' he said. `` They do n't give you a job, but they prepare you for a job.'' The first stage, called `` Basic Training,'' involves tests of skills, intellect and personality that determine what kind of job the vet is best suited for. Psychological and medical testing, <PERSON> Gitelson </PERSON> said, have uncovered `` brain injuries no one ever treated before.'' Group discussions, classroom work and counseling lead to instruction in how to prepare resumes and handle job interviews. <PERSON> Gitelson </PERSON> said 60 percent of the participants had been unemployed for six to nine months when they entered the program; 50 percent were transients. `` We're not talking about the easy guys,'' he said. `` But they're wonderful guys, with talent, who have somehow fallen on deaf ears.'' The jobs they find are split 50-50 blue collar and white collar, he said, averaging $ 18,000 annual starting pay, mostly with small and medium-sized businesses and public agencies. The program started as simply a job placement service. When an effort began to build a memorial in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> vets, <PERSON> Gitelson </PERSON>'s group supported it at public hearings. `` We wore suits _ everyone else was in jungle fatigues,'' he said. `` We said we also have to do something about those who are living.'' Fifty cents of every dollar contributed to the memorial was earmarked for a jobs program, and <ORGANIZATION> VVLP </ORGANIZATION> was selected as that program with $ 500,000 to start. It is also supported by state and federal funds.

 House members last year took trips to such faraway places as <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and as near as the <PERSON> Oprah </PERSON> <PERSON> Winfrey </PERSON> Show in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. They made speeches, toured defense plants and wrote magazine articles. They got gifts of golf sweaters and boxes of chocolates. These and thousands of other details were listed in the latest round of financial disclosure forms filed by more than 400 members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> and released on Wednesday. In general, members' incomes towered over the average American's. Most representatives' incomes topped the $ 100,000 mark last year, with fees from speech-making and article-writing adding substantially to their $ 89,500 annual salary. A handful reported making under $ 100,000, while more than a dozen reported assets and income over $ 1 million. The median family income in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is $ 31,526. The forms also offered a glimpse into the workings of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. For example: _ Rep <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, a member of the Appropriations defense subcommittee, reported receiving money for speeches from several defense companies, including <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> TRW </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Aerojet </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION>, Singer and <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION>. _ <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Rep <PERSON> Bud </PERSON> <PERSON> Shuster </PERSON>, the second-ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and the senior <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> member of the surface transportation subcommittee, reported receiving air fare from the <ORGANIZATION> Outdoor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advertising </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> for a trip to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. The association also paid him a $ 2,000 honorarium for a speech. In 1986, <PERSON> Shuster </PERSON> led a fight on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor against taking down billboards on the nation's highways without `` just compensation'' to the owner. The administrative aide to <PERSON> Shuster </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Eppard </PERSON>, said Wednesday that <PERSON> Shuster </PERSON> was not so much defending the outdoor advertising industry as the right to compensation if one's property is seized. _ Rep E. `` Kika'' de la <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, received honoraria from a number of food and textile groups, including the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Milk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Producers </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Amstar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sugar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, Grocery Manufacturers, Western Cotton Shippers, <ORGANIZATION> Monsanto </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cotton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>. His reimbursed travel included a limousine ride to <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sulphur </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, to attend a Grocery Manufacturers meeting House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, reported earnings of at least $ 168,000, although that did not include royalties from his book. Published reports have said that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> was paid royalties of 55 percent from his book, `` Reflections of a Public Man,'' far above the 10 percent to 15 percent authors normally receive. The royalties are crucial to a demand for an ethics committee investigation of the Democratic leader. Rep. <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> promised to sign the documents formally triggering such an investigation today. For his part, the <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> reported income of $ 122,284 to $ 133,283. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> promised on Wednesday to cooperate in any investigation. `` Although I know my actions have been in full accordance with <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules, I am concerned that the matters raised ... have led to increased public discussion, which I believe is unwarranted ...,'' he said in a letter Tuesday to the ethics committee. The <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Democrat also said that publication of the book had been halted at his orders. While the politicians are required to reveal their finances, the forms give only broad ranges for members' income, assets and debts. For example, one of the wealthier members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, reported income of at least $ 1.5 million and probably more than $ 3.3 million. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> listed assets of at least $ 3.9 million and probably more than $ 9.2 million. Other wealthy <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members and their minimum assets included <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Sisisky </PERSON>, D-Va., $ 8.27 million; <ORGANIZATION> Amory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Houghton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jr. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, $ 5.05 million; <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, D-Calif., $ 2.2 million; <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelosi </PERSON>, D-Calif., $ 3.6 million; <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, D-Calif., $ 1.65 million; <ORGANIZATION> Robert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mrazek </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, $ 1 million; <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>, R-Ga., $ 2.265 million; <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Yates </PERSON>, D-Ill., $ 1.565 million; <PERSON> Fortney </PERSON> <PERSON> Stark </PERSON>, D-Calif., $ 3.2 million; <ORGANIZATION> E. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shaw </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> R-Fla </LOCATION>., $ 1.16 million; and Many of these members reported liabilities, but all of them appeared to have net worths of at least $ 1 million. While millions of dollars were revealed in the reports, so were minuscule details. Among the exceptions to $ 100,000-plus incomes were: <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonior </PERSON>, D-Mich.; <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Penny </PERSON>, D-Minn.; <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Natcher </PERSON>, D-Ky.; <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ohio </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dornan </PERSON>, R-Calif.; <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Calif.; and <PERSON> Sherwood </PERSON> <PERSON> Boehlert </PERSON>, R-N.Y. <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, reported a long list of gifts, ranging from three boxes of chocolates and five neckties to a copy of the September Several House members apparently are avid golfers. They reported receiving travel reimbursements for attending golf tournaments and gifts of golf clothing and equipment. Among them was Rep. <PERSON> Fernand </PERSON> <PERSON> St </PERSON> <PERSON> Germain </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, who got more than $ 1,200 in golf shoes, sweaters and accessories from four charity golf tournaments.

 Here are some highlights of the catastrophic health insurance legislation approved Wednesday by a <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> conference committee: HOSPITAL _ Expands full coverage from maximum of 59 days a year to 364 days. A `` first-day'' deductible will continue to be required. DOCTOR BILLS _ Full payment of `` reasonable and proper'' doctor bills after an annual deductible is met. The deductible, yet to be precisely determined, will be from $ 1,320 and $ 1,400. <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> continues to pay 80 percent of charges, with the 20 percent not now covered counting toward the annual deductible for the catastrophic benefit. DRUGS _ <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> pays 50 percent of outpatient drug costs, after a $ 600 annual deductible, starting in 1991. <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> pays 60 percent the following year and 80 percent in 1993 and thereafter, with the deductible to be indexed to rising drug costs. Medicare now has no across-the-board prescription drug coverage. COSTS _ To be paid solely by Medicare beneficaries. Current Part B premium of $ 24.80 to increase by about $ 4 a month in 1989. By 1993, the `` catastrophic'' monthly premium is projected at $ 10.20, in addition to whatever the regular Part B premium is at that time. More than 60 percent of total program costs are to be financed by an additional `` supplemental'' premium that is linked to federal income tax liability. The supplemental is estimated at $ 22 a year per $ 150 of tax liability in 1989, rising to $ 42 a year per $ 150 of tax liability in 1993.

<HEAD>House Panel Warns of Dangers of Long-Range Weapons Treaty</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration should be wary of approving any deal with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> that makes deep reductions in the two superpowers' arsenals of long-range nuclear weapons, a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> report said. The Soviets would have a greater ability than the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> either to break out of any such treaty or to illegally hide weapons, according to the study by the panel's defense policy subcommittee. The report was released Wednesday, shortly after President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> left for <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for his fourth summit meeting with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. One of the agenda items at the summit is the proposed Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, which tentatively provides for reductions of up to 50 percent in each nation's arsenal of long-range atomic weapons. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say they are aiming for a START treaty that would leave each side with 6,000 long-range nuclear weapons. But many differences remain to be resolved. The treaty would be a successor to a separate pact eliminating medium-range nuclear weapons. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is currently considering the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty. `` No START agreement will come out of the summit next week and that's good,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Wis </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> `` There is a great deal to be done before arms control policy and weapons system decisions are harmonized.'' The report called the 6,000 figure `` an illusion'' because of the proposed methods for counting nuclear weapons. For example, a bomber would be counted as a single weapon, even though each airplane could carry numerous nuclear bombs and missiles. `` Almost 3,400 more Soviet weapons could be ` legal' under the prospective agreement,'' the report said. `` Thus, a force of nearly 9,400 Soviet weapons could be legally available under START.'' However, it noted, the same rules would apply to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` In fact, because the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has more bombers, it would probably end up with more legal weapons. Thus, the actual ceiling on weapons under START is more like 9,000-10 ,000 on each side rather than 6,000,'' the study said In addition, the study said, the treaty would be extremely difficult to verify, opening up possibilities for cheating. The report also noted a key difference between the proposed START pact and the medium-range treaty. The medium-range missile pact bars flight testing of missiles such as the SS-20s. Supporters of medium-range treaty say the ban means that if the Soviets are hiding some SS-20s, the missiles would quickly degrade and be of little military value. But no such ban is proposed by the START deal. `` So the military capability of any concealed forces will not decline over time,'' the study said. That would give the Soviets incentive to cheat. The report also said that for political reasons, the Soviets could find it easier to break out of START reductions. `` Given the history of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> strategic arms development, it seems unlikely that the president would propose such a course -LRB- a breakout -RRB- or the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> approve it. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> planner, however, could not rely upon internal checks and balances in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.'' Given those uncertainties, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military planners should worry about a `` Soviet force not of 6,000 weapons, but of many, many more,'' the study said. It concluded that maintaining the current doctrine of deterring nuclear war with the threat of overwhelming retaliation will require building the right type of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear force, even under START restrictions. That force should include a number of relatively `` low value'' targets, such as single-warhead, land-based missiles, which are widely dispersed. Such weapons are harder to hit, and thus increase deterrence, when compared with `` high value'' weapons like the 10-warhead MX and the huge Trident missile-firing submarines, the study said. But, the report said, `` the administration continues to deploy fewer and bigger weapons platforms even as it pursues a START agreement that favors smaller and more delivery systems.''

<HEAD>Burros: `Pet Rock of The '80s?'</HEAD>

 They may be smarter than horses and cuter than goats, but if you want to adopt a burro you ca n't be as stubborn as a mule. You'll have to put your name on a waiting list. Since the federal government started its `` adopt-a-burro'' program in 1976 to alleviate serious overcrowding in western states, thousands of the animals have been given out around the country. While people were apprehensive about adopting the pets at first, burro fever has soared. Now, there are n't enough around to meet the demand _ especially in the East and <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. `` We've got a waiting list of over 200 people who want them,'' said <PERSON> Deedee </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mustang </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Burro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Liberty </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` They're kind of the pet rock of the'80s.'' King said burros, which grow to the size of small ponies, make great pets. `` They're really mellow and do n't panic and get as flighty as horses,'' she said in a telephone interview. `` They're really social animals and very affectionate. Everybody says they turn into great big puppy dogs.'' But the animals, most of which are from <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, also come in handy. They can pull carts and often are used for predator control around smaller animals, such as sheep and goats. The 10,000-member association, which has placed about 700 burros in three years, is working on a breeding program for the animals. Just six years ago, federal authorities rounded up thousands of wild burros in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, saying their growing numbers threatened the environment. King, who also is a contractor of wild burros and horse adoption for the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>, said the government has placed more than 70,000 wild horses and burros since 1976, but private organizations have placed thousands more. One of those groups, <ORGANIZATION> Friends </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burros </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> based in <LOCATION> Marcellus </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> southwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, has placed about 160 burros in the state in the last five years, said <PERSON> Allene </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>, president of the 40-member group. `` We're basically a support group for the people here who've adopted already,'' said <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>, a farmer who has adopted five burros `` What we're involved in now is a burro rescue program and in cases where we see abuse, we look to buy the animal and place it.'' She decided to adopt the animals after hearing about the roundups in the <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> area of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> in the early'80s. Animal rights activists said the animals were being mistreated during the government's roundup. Before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> passed a law in 1971 to protect wild burros and horses, the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> usually got rid of the animals by shooting them. However, the only animals protected are those on land administered by the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> King </PERSON> said. A relatively small number of wild burros and horses remain unprotected on military grounds and land owned by the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Parks Services, she said.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is one step away from passing a bill that would ban nuclear weapons on Philippine territory but allow port calls by nuclear-powered ships. The bill, tentatively approved on Wednesday, is aimed at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and some officials view it as a slap in the face of the Americans. In another development, the military charged that six <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealanders </LOCATION> have been linked to communist rebels who staged an ambush in February in which a general's son and 10 other soldiers were killed. The announcement followed military claims that foreign journalists may have paid communist <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas to stage the ambush in <LOCATION> Albay </LOCATION> province in which Lt. <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawner </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and 10 of his men were killed. <PERSON> Brawner </PERSON> was the only son of Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawner </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who retired last month as the military commander for northern <LOCATION> Luzon </LOCATION>. Regarding the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mercado </LOCATION>, majority floor leader, said the body is expected to pass the nuclear weapons bill next week on its third reading, a formality where legislators officialy register their votes. The bill prohibits manufacture or storage of nuclear weapons in the country, but was amended to allow nuclear-powered vessels to make port calls after they are inspected by Philippine authorities. The chief sponsor of the measure, Sen. <PERSON> Wigberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanada </PERSON>, is an anti-nuclear activist who opposes <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. Most senators backed the bill and said it would give President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s administration a stronger hand in negotiating with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials on the future of <ORGANIZATION> Clark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, Subic Naval Base and four smaller <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military facilities in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. Government sources, however, said Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> expressed misgivings about the bill because of the negative affect it could have on U.S.-Philippine ties. Sen. <PERSON> Mamintal </PERSON> <PERSON> Tamano </PERSON>, who earlier expressed concern about the bill's implications, said: `` This is a backdoor way of repudiating the existing treaty between the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and the termination of the bases agreement. The Americans will be very uncomfortable with such a law, which will render the bases ineffective.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military policy forbids the military from disclosing which vessels are carrying nuclear weapons. Similar legislation in <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> led to a parliamentary election and raised questions about that country's committment to the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> alliance. American aircraft carriers and other warships believed to carry nuclear weapons call frequently at <LOCATION> Subic </LOCATION>. Many of them are either in transit to the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> or are returning from duty there. The claim linking foreign journalists to communist guerrillas was made by an alleged former rebel, who said she was a member of a guerrilla unit which staged the ambush in February, the military said. She reportedly said the foreigners were journalists and that they provided money and weapons to the guerrillas to stage the attack. Military officials said captured rebel documents indicated the six <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealanders </LOCATION> included five women and one man. In <LOCATION> Wellington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zealand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journalists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which represents journalists employed by state-owned media, said they had no records indicating the six are journalists. In the documents, all six were identified as members of various left-wing and women's organizations in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>. One of the women identified herself as a member of the `` <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> Conference for Filipino Concerns.'' She also reportedly said she was a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>.

Indeed, the breakdown of negotiations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to ease the de facto leader out of power was partially attributed in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to the threat that such a deal could pose to treaties giving <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> control of the canal. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> on Wednesday announced in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> the collapse of talks and said no further negotiations are planned. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have been linked since this isthmus achieved independence in 1903. In fact, it was <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> backing that secured <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s break from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and its declaring itself a sovereign nation. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> recognized the new nation immediately and began an association that led to the construction of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>, the creation of the Canal Zone and the establishment of military bases. Recovery of the Canal Zone, the area around the waterway, and of the canal itself have long been a Panamanian goal. Panamanians still quote <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s predecessor, the late Gen. <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Torrijos </PERSON>, who negotiated the 1977 canal treaties with then-President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>. <PERSON> Torrijos </PERSON>, who died in a 1981 plane crash and is a national idol, once said: `` I do not want to enter history, I want to enter the Canal Zone.'' <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s antipathy for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> began in 1987 after years of overt and tacit support for the man who, like <PERSON> Torrijos </PERSON>, heads the 15,000-strong Panamanian <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> and is the power behind the civilian government. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and his supporters say the reasons for that change are Panamanians' unwillingness to bend to the giant of the north, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s inclination to make friends on the left, and what was perceived as his presidential ambitions. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> also says <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> wants him out because he opposes continued <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> military presence in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> beyond Dec. 31, 1999, when the canal reverts to Panamanian control. It is believed in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's failure to oust <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> stems from its inability to realize the support he enjoys among the military and the working class, as well the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' ill-founded confidence that the political opposition could muster the necessary momentum The resiliency of Panamanians to face economic hardships brought on by tough <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sanctions also was unexpected. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has imposed increasingly severe economic sanctions since <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was indicted in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> in February on federal drug-trafficking charges. But even opposition politicians say <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s sudden dislike for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> responds `` more to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> strategic interests than to concern for the people of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>,'' as <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> put it. Many Panamanians have little use for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> or the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, a military and police organization that controls nearly every aspect of life in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Yet there is deep-seated suspicion that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is unwilling to cede, just 11 years from now, its extensive military installations. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, established to defend the canal, has evolved into an intelligence gathering center and coordinator of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military activities for all of <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Already, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has given up the Canal Zone, a bit of suburban <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> with manicured lawns and neatly painted houses, and transferred partial control of the canal to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Then the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> created the <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, made up of five Americans and four Panamanians, to administer the waterway that links the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> oceans. Ten-thousand <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military personnel are now stationed at 10 facilities. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> aims to sustain and improve this system of military installations beyond the year 2000 ... to establish a much larger force in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>,'' said Maj. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Delgado </PERSON> <PERSON> Diamante </PERSON>, executive director for <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> for Canal Treaty Affairs. According to a military source in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> considers the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> `` a watchtower for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and a center of espionage. The information it provided the English during the Falklands War was vital for them.'' The possibility of renegotiating the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military presence was one of the Panamanian concessions in the canal treaties. Most important among the concessions was that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, in accordance with its constitutional procedures, `` will always have the right to take action to defend the canal and maintain its neutrality.'' Some Panamanians say this amounts to giving the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> the permanent right to intervene in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Soviet Human Rights: Progress But Basic System of Repression
Unchanged</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HELSINKI, Finland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 During a speech several months ago, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> used a water glass to describe Soviet progress on human rights. Holding the glass aloft, Ambassador <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Matlock </PERSON> said that it would be inaccurate to view such a glass as half empty or half full. `` It's more like a glass that was dry and now has a little bit of moisture in it,'' he said. The issue of human rights is one of the touchiest subjects on the U.S.-Soviet agenda, evidenced by a sternly worded defense of Soviet policies by Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> during the December summit in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` What moral right does <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> have to assume the pose of the teacher?'' the general secretary asked. He said that he told President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, `` You are not the prosecutor and I am not the accused. ... I am not on trial.'' In an apparent attempt to soothe such touchiness, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> used one of his pre-summit speeches earlier this month to laud <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> for taking steps to loosen the stringent restrictions on the practice of religion, freedom of speech, press and emigration. In fact, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewry </ORGANIZATION> reported last week that 1,086 Jews departed the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in April, the highest monthly total in nearly seven years. Even though the figure has been rising for about a year, it falls far short of the 1979 levels, when the monthly average was about 4,000 departures. As <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials prepare to face their Soviet counterparts at the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit _ the 10th session on human rights in 15 months _ they point to such signs of progress, even as they warn that the basic system of repression has not changed. `` A few years ago, the entire process would have been simply unthinkable,'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Schifter </PERSON>, the assistant secretary of state for human rights and humanitarian affairs, said recently. He called such discussions `` a good first step,'' but only the beginning of an effort to see that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> abides by the human rights provisions of the <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> Final Act, which it signed along with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1975. Besides pressing for movement in the traditional cases of divided families, divided spouses and blocked marriages, the administration also has on its human rights agenda the problems of political prisoners, emigration and religious freedom. `` You can not speak of freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, freedom of association, freedom of the press being recognized in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, that is not the case. ... But sledgehammer tactics are no longer being used,'' <PERSON> Schifter </PERSON> said. Freedoms are still severely limited but people are not being punished as harshly for alleged transgressions. While demonstrations are still broken up, he said, the demonstrators might be arrested for a while and released, rather than being sent to <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> for several years. <PERSON> Shifter </PERSON> said it also appears that the Soviet leadership `` has basically given up on the deep commitment ... to conducting atheistic propaganda. That does n't mean they have more respect for religion than they had previously, but they simply have decided that this just is n't working ... and they might as well tackle the situation differently.'' He described the human rights situation as `` coming up to a better level from very, very far below, but nevertheless, there's a trend there and all we can say is we wish it would continue and perhaps accelerate.'' Other experts have suggested that whatever change is taking place is partially due to the Soviet leadership's domestic concerns rather than reaction to outside presssures. One administration expert, speaking on condition he not be identified, pointed to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s overtures to the religious communities, in particular his meeting with a group of Russian Orthodox archbishops. The session apparently was held to show that his `` glasnost'' policy of increased openness included religion. `` That could very well be seen as an effort of the Soviet authorities to mobilize a very large portion of the population, which has been practically excluded from civil life for decades, `` the official said. He said that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was impressive `` in recognizing that believers are Soviet patriots and Soviet citizens who can contribute.'' Seen in this light, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s planned visit to the <PERSON> Danilov </PERSON> monastery and his discussions with Soviet dissidents and refuseniks are not expected to overly concern Soviet officialdom, said another administration expert on the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` They'll act like it wo n't bother them, they know it's going to occur and they know the president wo n't do anything gratuitously embarrassing,'' he said. Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> has met with dissident <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> had sessions with American citizens during the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> summit last December so it is fully anticipated that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will hold such sessions, the expert said. `` They clearly know they have to do something on human rights to improve relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, but they wo n't admit it,'' he said. `` They want it to appear to be their initiative, and if that's the case, that's just fine.''

 The hospitalization of <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> has added a new twist to the bizarre drama in which <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> supporters are trying to use his mother's unburied body to help their hero return home. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was admitted on Wednesday to <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> suffering from chest pains. The Philippine consul in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Tomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON>, accused the 70-year-old <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> of faking his illness to win sympathy in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' wife, <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON>, said in a radio interview today that her husband was suffering because President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has refused to allow him to return to bury his 95-year-old mother, <PERSON> Josefa </PERSON> <PERSON> Edralin-Marcos </PERSON>, who died May 4. Presidential spokesman <PERSON> Teodoro </PERSON> <PERSON> Benigno </PERSON> reiterated on Wednesday that Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> would never waver from the ban, imposed in 1986 after <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was forced into exile following a civilian-military uprising. Meanwhile, the remains of <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' mother, a former schoolteacher, continue to lie in state in a suburban church, where dozens of <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> followers have maintained a round-the-clock vigil since her death three weeks ago. Indeed, the body of `` Dona Josefa'' has become the focus of renewed protests by <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' dwindling followers to demand their leader be allowed to come home. They have pledged that the body will stay in the church until <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> returns to bury it. Mortician <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Malabed </PERSON> said he embalmed the body twice and it could remain unburied for up to three months. To press their point, <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> loyalists have organized street marches, some drawing up to 10,000 people, where speakers rail against the government for denying <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> the `` human right'' to bid farewell to his mother. The use of corpses as political instruments is not without precedence in Philippine politics. The 1983 assassination of Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s husband, <PERSON> Benigno </PERSON>, was exploited by <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> opponents to mount street protests against the government. More than 1 million Filipinos turned out for <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s funeral 10 days after his assassination. <PERSON> Benigno </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s mother, <LOCATION> Aurora </LOCATION>, refused to have the body, which lay in state in an open casket, cleaned by morticians, saying she wanted the `` whole world to see what they have done to my son.'' <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' sister, <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Keon </PERSON>, was buried two weeks after her death in December 1986 as the family lobbied unsuccessfully with the <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> government to allow the former president to return for the funeral. But even by Philippine standards, the saga of `` Dona Josefa'' has dragged on to bizarre lengths. Mrs. <PERSON> Edralin-Marcos </PERSON> is expected to be buried in the family plot in <LOCATION> Batac </LOCATION> in the northern <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> province of <ORGANIZATION> Ilocos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Norte </ORGANIZATION>. But an employee of the suburban church, who refused to give her name, said the family has still not informed the parish staff when the body will be moved. `` The family has not yet set any particular date for the funeral,'' <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' sister, <PERSON> Fortuna </PERSON> <PERSON> Barba </PERSON>, told reporters on Wednesday. `` When we do decide, it will be properly announced and disseminated by us and nobody else.'' Uncertainty about the funeral date appears to reflect divisions within the pro-Marcos camp among various groups seeking to demonstrate that they speak for the `` Apo,'' or `` Grand Old Man,'' as <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> is known to his followers. One group has called for a huge caravan to accompany the body from <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> north to <LOCATION> Batac </LOCATION>, a distance of 240 miles. They have suggested stopping at cities along the way for public viewings in a bid to stir up support in <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' northern strongholds. On Tuesday, rumors spread that <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> supporters would hold a pre-dawn mass Wednesday morning and then spirit the body secretly to <LOCATION> Batac </LOCATION>. Reporters rushed to the church, <PERSON> Sanctuario </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON> <PERSON> Jose </PERSON>, only to find the coffin still there. The unseemly performance prompted Mrs. <PERSON> Barba </PERSON> to issue a statement warning against `` conjectures, speculations, canards or disinformation to mislead and confuse the people.'' Meanwhile, residents of the swank <LOCATION> Greenhills </LOCATION> neighborhood, where the church is located, have threatened to launch a petition drive to demand that Archbishop Cardinal <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Sin </PERSON> intervene and order the body removed.

 Despite the gay and lesbian protesters who picket campaign appearances by <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> front-runner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor is virtually certain to get their votes in the fall. `` The choice is pretty obvious. Lesbians and gay men will vote for <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in the fall'' when presented with a choice between <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON>, who was sharply critical of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> over his position on foster care by homosexuals for children. <PERSON> Vin </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> lawyer in charge of the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign's efforts to reach out to the gay community, said, `` There is no question in my mind that he will receive the lion's share of the gay and lesbian vote in November.'' It is <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' support for giving heterosexual couples preference in placement of children in foster homes that draws gay protestors to his appearances, but many political strategists say the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor comes out ahead politically on that confrontation. `` The vast majority of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people agree with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckel </PERSON>, who managed <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>'s 1984 presidential campaign. `` From a political standpoint, that's a no-win issue for the gay community.'' In fact, many Republicans working to elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> chafe at the fact that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is being perceived as a moderate because of his primary battles with <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and because he is being picketed by homosexual groups. A <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> strategist, speaking only with assurance of anonymity, said that a candidate such as <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, on the verge of winning the party's presidential nomination, is not looking to create fights. `` But to the degree that you have to have somebody picket you, you certainly would not mind the gays picketing you over the issue, not of civil rights or civil liberties, but over foster care for children, saying your law is too pro-family or too pro-heterosexual,'' the Democrat said. Still, foster care is a highly charged issue in the gay community. `` For <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to have gone out of his way to limit or restrict the parenting options for lesbians and gay men was a kick in the gut,'' said <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON>, director of the privacy project for the National Gay and <ORGANIZATION> Lesbian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON> said she believes <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> considers lesbians and gay men `` sexual criminals.'' While campaigning in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> prior to that state's June 7 presidential primary, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> repeatedly has encountered gay demonstrators. `` Bush + <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> ... More AIDS Deaths,'' read signs carried by demonstrators at a recent <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> appearance in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` We need a president who's not afraid to talk about AIDS,'' shouted a demonstrator. A disproportionate number of victims of AIDS _ acquired immune deficiency syndrome _ are homosexuals. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> responded that <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> `` spends more per case for AIDS than any state in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' He repeatedly referred to AIDS as `` the most serious public health problem we've had in our lifetime.'' <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON> said that in 1985 there was no funding for AIDS in the state budget and money was later included only after pressure from <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' state health director. `` People were pretty upset about it,'' she said. `` Since that time I think that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' administration has been fairly responsive. It was only after this pretty major outcry in the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> area around the zero-funding that they responded.'' When the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor appeared before a group of homosexual activists in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, he was asked repeatedly about the foster care policy. `` Because I think it's best, all things being equal, for a child to grow up in a household with a mother and father and other children,'' he said. `` Bigot,'' shouted one man. `` You're anti-gay, why do n't you admit it,'' yelled another. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> policy on placing of foster children gives preference to heterosexual couples with child-raising experience and to relatives of the child in need of care. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> vetoed legislation that would have prohibited homosexual couples from providing foster care. <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> said, `` There's a perception in the gay community that the governor did damage to the gay and lesbian community when he adopted the foster care policy. Attitudinal issues are always the toughest things to work through.'' But, he said, `` Notwithstanding the anger, much of which was legitimate _ I certainly felt it as a gay supporter of <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> _ he has stayed stable in terms of his commitment to gay and lesbian civil rights and in terms of a sound and balanced AIDS policy.''

 State and <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lighting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> negotiators early Thursday reached a tentative agreement that would see the utility abandon the $ 5.3 billion <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> nuclear power plant, the governor's office said. Should the agreement be finalized, it would mark the first time a completed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear power plant was abandoned before it opened. The agreement, announced by <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Fryer </PERSON>, a spokesman for Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, would allow financially troubled <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION> to continue to operate as a privately owned utility. The state had been proceeding with a possible takeover of the entire company. The agreement in principle was announced 95 minutes after <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>'s midnight deadline for an agreement. On Wednesday, <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> had threatened to call off negotiations if <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION> failed to agree to a deal and then resume the state's court suit to keep <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> closed. At one point early Thursday, <PERSON> Fryer </PERSON> told reporters that the deal had been called off shortly before midnight but then quickly retracted the statement after apparently receiving further information. Details of the agreement were n't immediately available. But <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> had demanded that <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION> restructure its management and cease its efforts to win a license to operate at 25 percent capacity. Those conditions have been met as part of the deal, <PERSON> Fryer </PERSON> said. As part of the agreement, the state would buy Shoreham for $ 1 and have it decontaminated and decommissioned at <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION>'s expense, <PERSON> Fryer </PERSON> said. New generating plants would then be built on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> to ensure that residents have a sufficient supply of electricity. `` The next step would be to reduce all these intricacies to written copy,'' <PERSON> Fryer </PERSON> said. If approved, the deal will end years of attempts by environmentalists, local activists and others to close <PERSON> Shoreham </PERSON>, on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>'s north shore. The plant, completed in 1984, has never been opened because of the refusal of state and local officials to approve an emergency evacuation plan. The officials had argued that <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, because of its geography, could not be safely evacuation during a nuclear accident and without such approval the federal <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> had refused to issue an operating license. But state efforts to close <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> accelerated after the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> in October eliminated the rule requiring state and local government participation in an evacuation plan. The future of the plant has been in limbo for years and the delays in construction and the licensing effort, along with massive cost overruns, drove <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION> to near bankruptcy. The plant, conceived in 1965, was completed 10 years late and more than 80 times over its original budget of $ 65 million. In addition to fears over the <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> plant's safety, negotiations have been driven by the fact that <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION>'s nearly 1 million customers pay the second highest electricity rates in the country, second only to neighboring <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION>. The utility's problems were highlighted after Hurricane Gloria in September 1985 knocked out power to more than 80 percent of <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION>'s customers. During the storm, <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Catacosinos </PERSON> refused to return home from an <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> vacation. Safety fears were heightened after the nuclear disaster at the Chernobyl plant in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.

 Democratic presidential front-runner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, trying to establish a bond with voters 3,000 miles from home, says <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> has `` great similiarities'' to his home state of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> today, campaigning in advance of the June 7 primary. But <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s 47 electoral votes make it the biggest prize in the general election, and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> tentatively has made plans to return shortly after the primary for additional campaigning. Both <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> have a `` very strong commitment to education,'' he said Wednesday night during a debate with rival <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, brushing aside a comment from a panelist that there also were notable differences. `` We are both high-tech states,'' he went on. `` We're both states that value our environment ... we're both states and regions that are coastal, states and regions that understand how important these ocean resources and coastline happen to be, and how important it is to preserve them.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, a methodical man campaigning in a state known for flamboyance, made his pitch to the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> voters as he set out on a quick campaign swing through the state on Wednesday. And as befits the almost-certain Democratic nominee, he made it clear that he is looking beyond the primary to the November election. In his five-minute closing statement during the debate, he not only appealed for support in the primary _ less than two weeks away _ but also pointed out that voters will face a choice between two very different candidates in the fall. Public opinion polls show him leading <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, and ahead of Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the certain <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> nominee, in a fall matchup. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> took care not to offend his Democratic rival during their hour-long debate, but he also held his ground when <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> tried to pressure him into proposing a detailed budget plan and into declaring <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> a terrorist state for its support of rebels fighting neighboring black governments. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> says it is too early to make a detailed spending plan, and wants to pursue other measures against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, including stronger economic sanctions, before considering tougher measures. The two men met privately after the debate, although the governor declined to say what they discussed beyond `` a lot of things, family, campaign debates, issues.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> used his time during the debate to repeat criticisms of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s policies, but he also issued a statement wishing the president a `` successful summit'' with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. `` Today we have the best opportunity in our lifetimes to reduce the risk of nuclear war,'' he said. During the debate, he said the superpowers should stop `` wandering around the world like lonesome cowboys'' intervening militarily.

<TEXT>
 To his followers, Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is a symbol of Panamanian nationalism _ a brave <PERSON> David </PERSON> standing firm against the imperialist Goliath of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Detractors see <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s military leader as an unscrupulous despot who threatens to drag the country down with him. The general is a shrewd, tough child of poverty, schooled in intrigue. As far as the White House is concerned, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is criminal, a man who enriched himself by selling his country to Colombian drug traffickers. On Wednesday, Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> announced that talks with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s people on the general's exit from power had broken down. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> managed to become head of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> _ chief of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s military and police _ through his loyalty to his predecessor and mentor, Gen. <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Torrijos </PERSON>. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, whose official biography says he is 50, has little faith in the ability of civilians to rule. `` Our young officers are much better prepared to govern when <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> takes over the -LRB- <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> -RRB- Canal operations in the year 2000,'' he once said in an interview. The handsome, charismatic <PERSON> Torrijos </PERSON> changed the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> from an organization led by the social elite into a tightly disciplined force of 15,000 with absolute police, military and political power. He opened the upper ranks to the lower economic classes and created a base of power from a new generation of officers. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, a poor boy who went to military school in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> on a scholarship, was among them. Less than a year after taking power in a coup in 1968, <PERSON> Torrijos </PERSON> made <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, an obscure provincial lieutenant with only four years of military service, his chief of intelligence. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> quickly began collecting dossiers on everyone who counted in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, friends and enemies alike. He developed close ties with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence agencies interested in any potential threat to the security of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>, a vital shipping link between the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> oceans. <PERSON> Torrijos </PERSON> also gave <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> jurisdiction over customs and immigration, long a source of funds for the military. After <PERSON> Torrijos </PERSON> died in an unexplained plane crash in 1981, it took <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> about two years to shoulder his way to the top command. Once there, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> boldly exercised his power and tolerated little opposition. He closed the private news media for months at a time for alleged offenses ranging from personal insults to incitment to disobedience. Unhappy with the outcome of the first popular election in 16 years, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> installed his own president in 1984. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, a short, jowly, pockmarked man his detractors call `` pineapple face,'' never possessed the charisma of his populist mentor, but he was backed by the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which <PERSON> Torrijos </PERSON> founded. As demands for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s ouster have grown during the past year, the party vowed to stick by him `` to the end'' and portrayed him as the defender of Panamanian `` sovereignty and dignity'' in the face of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aggression. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has worked hard to develop the image of a man of the people. His private life is that of a rich man, but publicly he has stressed his humble origins and spent weekends courting the residents of rural towns and villages. With the deepening of his political crisis, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has tried to use his popular image to build support in this nation of 2.2 million people, many of them black and mulatto. `` The humble, the poor, the blacks, they are the utmost authority of this people,'' he said in one speech. His official salary is $ 60,000 a year but he is said to have his finger in a wide range of enterprises, among them duty-free liquor stores, maritime services, banks, gambling casinos, newspapers, a television station and 12 radio stations.

<HEAD>Foreign Aid Bill Denies Money To Drug-Trafficking Nations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The House has sent to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> a $ 14.3 billion foreign aid bill that includes a ban on aid to any foreign government or military force involved in drug trafficking, bribery, tax evasion, graft or price fixing. Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Obey </PERSON>, D-Wis., offered the amendment banning aid to those nations involved in drugs or other crimes after Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, R-Pa., offered one limited to `` If we're against the baddies of this world, we might as well be against them all,'' <PERSON> Obey </PERSON> said. Obey's amendment was approved on a voice vote. The foreign aid bill, passed by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on a 328-90 vote, was the first separate foreign aid package the the House has approved since 1981. Lawmakers generally are reluctant to support spending overseas when domestic needs go unfulfilled, and in recent years, the legislation has been buried in large, catchall spending bills. But last fall's deficit reduction agreement set the overall foreign aid spending level for fiscal 1989, which begins Oct. 1. A bipartisan compromise, with administration support, was reached in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Appropriations Committee on how to divide up that pie. About $ 5.8 billion of the total would be earmarked for military aid, $ 3.3 billion in economic grants, and most of the remainder for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and international organizations and financial institutions. Overall, the bill would continue current programs and authorize about 2 percent more spending than last year, reversing the trend of the past few years to cut foreign aid. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> would receive about a third of the money in the bill. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> again would receive more than any other country, $ 1.8 billion in military aid and $ 1.2 billion in economic assistance. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> would get $ 1.3 billion in military assistance and $ 815 million in economic aid. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> would receive $ 220 million in economic aid and $ 240 million dollars in forgiven loans for purchase of military goods. The <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> would receive about $ 250 million, half in military assistance. About $ 700 million in economic assistance would go to African countries. In <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> would get $ 85 million in economic aid, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> $ 90 million, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> $ 185 million and <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> $ 80 million. Military aid for those and other countries was not earmarked, but would come out of separate military aid and credit accounts. Aid to the Contra rebels in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> was not part of the legislation. About 100 countries receive <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid directly. Besides Obey's amendment, another voice vote removed the earmarking of money for specific countries cooperating with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug eradication efforts, allowing the individual totals to be set later based on the performance of the countries.

<HEAD>Senate Passes Legislation to Ban Plastic Handguns</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has joined the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in taking aim against plastic guns, whether they be handguns designed to pass through metal detectors or just toys. By a voice vote, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday approved legislation to outlaw the manufacture, sale or possession of handguns made from plastic or other `` undetectable'' parts that could evade metal detectors. The measure primarily is directed at terrorists and airplane hijackers, but was amended to include a requirement that all toy guns have orange plugs in their barrels to clearly identify them as toys. `` This bill is designed to prevent a nightmare from becoming reality,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, who co-sponsored the legislation with Sen. <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-S.C. </LOCATION> `` Its aim is to keep terrorists from getting powerful, undetectable firearms which could be smuggled past security devices at airports, courtrooms and even the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> said. The plastic gun ban is similar to legislation approved by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, 413-4, earlier this month. Differences between the two bills will have to be ironed out before the gun ban is sent to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for his signature. The nation's major law enforcement groups lobbied heavily for the legislation, and worked out the compromise language with Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, after initial reluctance, went along with the approach. Senate Republican Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, a sponsor of the amendment to clearly identify toy guns, said realistic plastic guns `` have been used in the commission of crimes, such as bank robbery, hostage takings and street crime.'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> also recalled that in one case, `` a police officer in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> accidentally shot a youth playing with a toy laser gun, after mistaking the toy for a firearm.'' An amendment by <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> added provisions that would make it a crime to possess a firearm in a federal courtroom, increase penalties for possession of explosives in airports and boost penalties for use or possession of explosives in commission of a federal felony. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> legislation would require that all firearms be as detectable as a 3.7-ounce stainless steel handgun. All guns currently manufactured or imported into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would have to meet the test. While the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill sets a detectability standard, the House-passed measure requires that the gun itself contain 3.7 ounces of metal. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> measure also would require that new, state-of-the-art metal detectors be used at airports, federal courthouses and other federal security checkpoints. The House bill does not include the metal detector provision.

<HEAD>Town With Traditional Claims on Lifeguards Can't Afford Them This

<TEXT>
 Budget problems will force beachgoers to swim at their own risk this summer in this town, which has its own lifesaving museum. `` It's not funded,'' Selectman <PERSON> Claudette </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzsimmons </PERSON> said of the lifeguard allotment. `` It's not going to be funded.'' The town 10 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> has allocated less than $ 24,000 to pay eight full-time and four part-time summer police officers, about equal to the payroll for 10 lifeguards and a supervisor. When the budget was being considered, `` it came down to a judgment call whether it was seasonal lifeguards or seasonal police officers,'' said Exeuctive Administrator <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCabe </PERSON>. So, four beaches normally supervised by <PERSON> Hull </PERSON> lifeguards will not be staffed this year. Police Chief <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooker </PERSON> contended that summer police are badly needed to deal with overflows on hot days. <PERSON> Hull </PERSON>'s population of 10,000 swells to 100,000 on the hottest days. <PERSON> Hull </PERSON> is in the middle of a prolonged fiscal crisis. A referendum is scheduled for June 27 to seek approval for an additional $ 1.5 million in taxes on top of the already approved $ 15 million operating budget. None of the additional money is slated for lifeguards. Local hero <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON>'s rescue of shipwreck victims more than 100 years ago gave rise to <PERSON> Hull </PERSON>'s claim to lifesaving fame. <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiers </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Hull </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lifesaving </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION>, said it's ironic that a town with <PERSON> Hull </PERSON>'s history would have to cut its lifeguards `` We have a really strong fire department that wears a badge of <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> on their sleeves; some are descendants of the original lifesavers,'' she said. `` There's a commitment to lives here.''

<TEXT>
 A teen-ager who left her infant sons alone for three hot days was ordered to practice birth control for the rest of her child-bearing years by a judge who rebuked her as a `` child having children.'' Other terms of a lifetime probation given to <PERSON> Debra </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Forster </PERSON> prohibit her from seeing the two boys as well as a daughter she later bore. She must also provide weekly reports to the probation office on her birth control use. Ms. <PERSON> Forster </PERSON>, 18, pleaded guilty in April to two counts of felony child abuse for leaving her two sons alone in an apartment, without food or water, for three days last May. She could have received 30 years in prison. The boys, <PERSON> William </PERSON> and <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, respectively 18 months - and 6 months-old at the time, were hospitalized eight days for malnutrition, lesions caused by a rash and dehydration <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> was close to death from dehydration when he was found, the police said. Both have since recovered. Temperatures for the three-day period ranged from 100 during the day and 73 at night; the average was 87 degrees, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> says. The children were found by Ms. <PERSON> Forster </PERSON>'s estranged husband, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON>, who called police. Authorities removed the children from the house and Ms. <PERSON> Forster </PERSON> was arrested hours later when she showed up at the <ORGANIZATION> Mesa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Judge <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> <PERSON> Budzyn </PERSON> said the sentence was the only way she could make sure the woman would not hurt other children since society offers little or no support for potential abusers. `` We do n't have a lot of help out there for people,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Maricopa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge said in an interview Wednesday, a day after issuing the sentence. But <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Bendheim </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> attorney, called it `` an incredible sentence,'' and doubted it would hold up under constitutional pressures. `` I'm sure Judge <PERSON> Budzyn </PERSON> thought it was a sentence that fit the crime but we have a system that does n't allow such an intrusion into private life,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Bendheim </PERSON>, who is on the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION>'s national board As the judge pronounced the sentence she told Ms. <PERSON> Forster </PERSON>, `` Your case represents the epitome of what's wrong with our society: a child having children.'' `` I know I did something wrong, and I have to pay for it,'' Ms. <PERSON> Forster </PERSON> replied. `` I'm sorry.'' On Wednesday, the judge characterized Ms. <PERSON> Forster </PERSON> as a young woman of average intelligence who is emotionally immature. Ms. <PERSON> Forster </PERSON> gave birth to a daughter while in jail awaiting the child-abuse trial. According to court records, a family friend adopted the daughter, and the sons were being placed through an adoption agency. Ms. <PERSON> Forster </PERSON> was released from custody Tuesday and will live in a treatment center. Court officials have refused to release the name of the center, saying Ms. <PERSON> Forster </PERSON> has received death threats. Although the order requires the woman to submit written proof to her probation officer that she is using some form of birth control, she will not be required to undergo any physical testing, <PERSON> Budzyn </PERSON> said. `` There would be no way, with an order like this, that she would be subject to physical tests,'' the judge said. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffen </PERSON>, a defense attorney in a 1986 child-abuse case in which the defendant was initially sentenced to undergo sterilization, said he believed the judge had gone too far. `` I think the court has acted outside its role and limitations,'' <PERSON> Griffen </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> later vacated the sterilization sentence in the case, in which the abused child died. <PERSON> Griffen </PERSON> said that ruling could apply to an appeal of the sentence by Ms. <PERSON> Forster </PERSON>'s attorney, Assistant Public Defender <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Billar </PERSON>. <PERSON> Billar </PERSON> was said by his office to be in court Wednesday and not available for comment.

<HEAD>Subcommittee Approves Closing Loopholes For Non-Profits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel is calling for a tax on some of the activities of colleges, hospitals and other non-profit organizations that often compete directly with taxpaying businesses. Under a proposal that won tentative approval of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> oversight subcommittee Wednesday, college bookstores might have to pay tax on some of their computer sales, and a museum might be taxed on food sales if an eating facilities caters primarily to the general public. Although aides said the package of proposals was given a preliminary endorsement by most subcommittee members, it is a long way from becoming law in this election year. No similar legislation is pending in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Neither Rep. <PERSON> J.J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickle </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, chairman of the subcommittee, nor <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapoton </PERSON>, assistant secretary of the treasury for tax policy, who assisted in drafting the proposals, would comment on their content. The legislation was put together behind closed doors. However, a subcommittee staff member, who would not be quoted by name, offered reporters a general outline of the package and said the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> agrees with most of the provisions. She said the subcommittee would take a final look at the package early next month. The proposals would strengthen the `` unrelated-business-income tax,'' which was enacted in 1950 to protect small businesses against unfair competition from tax-exempt organizations. The subcommittee began drafting the new legislation after months of complaints from businesses that they are still finding it hard to compete. <PERSON> Chapoton </PERSON>, testifying before the subcommittee earlier this month, cautioned against any broad overhaul of the tax, but he endorsed an effort to apply the tax specifically to certain activities of tax-exempt organizations. It was that approach that won preliminary endorsement of <PERSON> Pickle </PERSON>'s subcommittee. In general, income from gift shops and bookstores operated by tax-exempt organizations would be taxed, with exceptions for low-cost mementos. The tax would be applied to most catalog and mail-order sales. A college bookstore could continue to avoid tax on income from items that are `` in furtherance of educational programs'' _ textbooks, for example _ and on a portion of computer sales to students. One subcommittee member said the bookstore could avoid tax on sales of computers to up to half the student body per year, so long as a professor signed a statement that a computer was a necessity for a course. The tax also would be applied to income from some sales or rental of medical equipment, including hearing aids and oxygen tanks. Travel and tour services offered by schools, museums and other non-profit organizations would fall under the tax, as would their adjunct off-premise food services. The tax would apply to most hotel facilities that are patronized by the general public. Authorities have not estimated how much tax would be collected under the proposal. However, aides emphasize the package is aimed at improving fairness _ not raising revenue. At the Ways and Means hearing earlier this month, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Swain </PERSON>, chief advocacy counsel for the <ORGANIZATION> Small </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, said present law has `` allowed non-profits to earn non-taxable income from activities never contemplated by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. ... The distinction between the two sections has become blurred _ in some instances, beyond recognition.''

<TEXT>
 A spokesman for Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> staged a `` vulgar ambush'' by hinting the U.S.-Panama crisis was ending then blaming the military leader for the collapse of negotiations. Some <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> associates said the talks were not over yet. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s 67-member <ORGANIZATION> Legislative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> has summoned <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> for a status report on the negotiations. Opposition parties said they would not attend. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is scheduled to appear before the assembly this afternoon. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said on Wednesday that a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiating effort to induce <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, the power behind the civilian government, to go into exile this summer broke down and no further talks were planned. `` At the final moment in negotiations, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> would not carry through with the arrangements his representatives had negotiated,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. `` No offers remain on the table.'' A pro-government newspaper, <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Republica </PERSON>, said the military was nervous about some of the tentative agreements. Maj. <PERSON> Edgardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s spokesman, called the situation a `` vulgar ambush mounted by the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'' aimed at throwing <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> off balance and regaining the lost American initiative. <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> noted that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had said publicly there could be no agreement as long as <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> `` aggression'' against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> continued and that the talks were `` conversations'' not negotiations. A Panamanian government spokesman, <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON>, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` failed in an attempt to impose its demands, then tried to put out false versions of the events.'' <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> contended that Panamanian negotiators never agreed to discuss dismissal of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug smuggling charges against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. He added that the sole Panamanian aim was to `` cease economic aggression and military threats against the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> people.'' Key provisions of the proposed agreement called for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s resignation in August as commander of the Panamanian Defense Forces, his departure from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and, in exchange, the dismissal of the drug smuggling indictments The goal was to remove <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> from the Panamanian political scene as the country moved toward civilian-led rule with presidential elections in May 1989. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been seeking <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s removal since he was indicted in February by a federal grand jury in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> on charges of taking at least $ 4.6 million in payoffs from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s so-called <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel to protect cocaine shipments, launder money and hide drug smugglers from law enforcement officials <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> Sonnett </PERSON>, who represents <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> on the drug indictments, said in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> that he doubts the talks have ended. `` I have heard that only from the secretary of state and I remember hearing the secretary of state say that last March,'' <PERSON> Sonnett </PERSON> said on Wednesday. <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republica </ORGANIZATION> said the critical issue was the presidency of <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON>, who took over after <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> engineered the dismissal of President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> in February. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> still recognizes <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> as the nation's legitimate president <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> has been in hiding since his ouster and there is an arrest warrant out for him. <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Republica </PERSON> said the military `` rejected the points of conversation because they found no guarantee for the continuity of the constitutional mandate'' of <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON>. Military officials also feared the agreement as proposed would cause `` political confrontations among Panamanians,'' the newspaper said. `` For us <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON> is president, but the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> insists on recognizing <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON>, a legislator from the governing <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and a close ally of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. He contended the talks are only in `` recess'' after an inability to smooth out a few final problems. Both <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON> were put in office by the military, come from relative political obscurity and are part of a long line of similar presidents.

<HEAD>Record Company Awarded $3.2 Million in Dispute over George Benson

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A jury has ruled that <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION>. Records must pay more than $ 3.2 million in damages to a rival record-maker for breaching an agreement with Grammy Award-winning jazz guitarist <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> The suit, filed by <ORGANIZATION> Creed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Taylor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, alleged that <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION> earned more than $ 20 million in net profits from three albums that the guitarist made while he was obliged to make three records for CTI. CTI alleged it was forced into bankruptcy proceedings because it lost <PERSON> Benson </PERSON>, who was the top recording artist on the <ORGANIZATION> CTI </ORGANIZATION> label when the agreement was made in 1975. The 11-member <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury agreed Wednesday that the agreement had been breached, but jurors appeared to be deadlocked in trying to determine whether <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> had acted with malice or fraud. Judge <PERSON> Dion </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrow </PERSON> said he would declare a mistrial on that portion of the lawsuit if the jury was unable to reach a decision today. <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> won three Grammy Awards in 1976, including two for songs from his <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> album, `` Breezin','' one of the biggest selling jazz albums of all time. He followed that with two other albums on the <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> label, `` In Flight'' and `` Weekend in <LOCATION> L.A. </LOCATION>'' Attorneys for <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> argued that the company's net profits from the three albums amounted to only $ 10.8 million, and that even if <ORGANIZATION> CTI </ORGANIZATION>'s allegations were true, its profits would have been far less than that.

<TEXT>
 Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> is waging an aggressive campaign to offset the political damage his legal troubles have caused the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, says a congressman. In two meetings Wednesday which he initiated, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> made clear he has no intention of resigning and intends to advance the conservative agenda in the waning months of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, said participants in the discussions. He said the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> will aggressively prosecute child pornography cases, work to break a logjam on judicial nominations and help lead the administration's attack on drugs. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> offered an 18-page rebuttal to criticism of his assistance to scandal-plagued <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and told another group of conservatives, the <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, his conduct has been entirely proper. At a meeting with 16 conservative congressmen, `` a couple of members'' said the year-old criminal investigation of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> is resulting in `` political damage being done,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, R-Pa., head of a group of conservative <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members called the <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opportunity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said the context of `` political damage'' was to the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the presidential campaign of Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the likely <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nominee. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> was told that if he is going to take an aggressive stance in response to criticism, it `` is going to have to be a very good offense.'' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> `` acknowledged he would have to take that kind of -LRB- aggressive -RRB- position to stem the political damage,'' said <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>. `` He felt he had a duty in terms of himself and the law and politics to clear the air. `` He made it quite clear that he has no intention of resigning,'' said <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> also met at his own urging with senior editors of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, a conservative newspaper that recently called on the attorney general to resign. In a report on the interview today, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said he `` recently'' discussed his legal problems with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` I'm not going to do anything to hurt the vice president,'' he said, adding that the only negative impact on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s presidential campaign is that `` a lot of people ask him questions about this, which takes up time to answer which ought to be reserved for answers on the issues.'' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said he stays `` in pretty close touch'' with the people who advise President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on public opinion polls and would `` take into account'' poll data `` on whether I am damaging the president.'' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> told the congressmen a report in the next few weeks by an independent counsel who has been investigating <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> since May 11, 1987, `` will clear him completely,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Cass </PERSON> <PERSON> Ballenger </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, who attended the meeting. The report is expected to raise questions about <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s ethical behavior, but participants said that issue did n't come up in the discussion.

 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> took <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to task over budget matters and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, but he emerged from a meeting with his <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> presidential rival saying that the two are `` keenly aware of our joint responsibility to our party.'' The two aired a few disagreements during a debate Wednesday night, but spent far more time talking about matters they agreed on. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was campaigning in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> today. In recent days, he has been stumping hard in the state, which holds its primary June 7. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also had stops planned later today in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, which holds its primary the same day as <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s. During the one-hour debate in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> pressed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for details about his budget plan. In response, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said trying to formulate a detailed budget plan so far in advance would be `` a serious mistake.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> kept pressing him, however, saying that `` the governor is laying out a budget of promises but not a budget of numbers.'' When <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> if he would use military force against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor replied that he would press for more effective sanctions. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> later added, `` Yes, one aspect of a tough anti-terrorist policy is the use of military force against terrorist base camps. But there are many ways to attack terrorism.'' But <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> reserved his toughest comments for criticism of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's dealings with <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. The debate came hours after Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> announced that talks aimed at getting <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to step down had collapsed. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> mocked the administration's efforts to negotiate with the military leader. `` All we really know is, there was this courtship of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> by the administration. ... There was marriage to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, putting him on the payroll ... There was a divorce. And then there was the bargain to patch up the marriage,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` Now we're being discredited in a failed policy.'' Earlier Wednesday, he made a speech criticizing administration policy in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` The $ 10 billion spent chasing 3 million Sandinistas ... that money should have been spent chasing poverty, illiteracy and disease and building houses ... in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` It was immoral and illegal and a misappropriation of funds.'' The Democratic contender helped load food and medical supplies onto a truck bound for <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. After the debate, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> met privately with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, and spoke of the need to `` keep expanding our coalition.'' He also joked they had talked about `` trying to balance my ticket with a conservative.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said the two also discussed party unity. `` We are keenly aware of our joint responsibility to keep expanding our party ... -LRB- and build -RRB- a strong coalition.''

<TEXT>
 A few years ago, an oft-told story goes, a city traffic cop had somehow obtained a hand-held radar gun and decided to test it by clocking the speeding motorcade of then-Soviet leader <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>. As the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief's shiny black ZIL limousine, two others bearing bodyguards and a pair of <LOCATION> Volga </LOCATION> sedans flashed onto the horizon of <LOCATION> Kutuzovsky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prospekt </LOCATION>, the officer aimed the detector at the fast-approaching motorcade. The radar gun broke as it crashed to the ground, dropped by the policeman who had been shot between the eyes by sharp-shooting secret police agents who guard the Soviet leader. The story can not be verified and may well be apochryphal, as radar traps are still rare in the Soviet capital. But the armed guards who ride in the leader's motorcade, with their gun barrels poised low in the open car windows, are reputed to be expert riflemen. And the tale of the hapless policeman surfaces whenever talk turns to security around the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader. Protection of the current ruler or visiting dignitaries is more effectively ensured in a police state, where the untold legions of secret agents keep a close eye on known troublemakers and are less encumbered than their Western counterparts by rules protecting citizens' civil rights. The risk of a terrorist strike against Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> or President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> during their May 29-June 2 meetings here is probably lower than in just about any other country of the world. But the measures taken to protect them will be no less visible than in the most dangerous spots on the globe. Soviet founder <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> was wounded in a 1918 assassination attempt, inspiring development of a security force around the leader that strengthened during the nearly three decades that dictator <PERSON> Jos </PERSON> ef <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> was in power. No other attempts on the life of the leader have been documented, although there have been rumors about several, including against <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. Gun ownership has been forbidden here since the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution that brought the Soviets to power, and illegal possession of firearms carries a five-year prison term. Soviets are even prohibited from carrying hunting knives without special permits attesting that the potential weapons are part of a national costume or for actual use while hunting. Secrecy surrounds most of the movements of the Soviet leader and his guests, with exact departure and arrival times for trips outside the capital kept secret from all but the uppermost echelon of power. When the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency announces that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will visit a Western nation, it usually specifies only in which half of the month the trip will take place. The first indication that the Soviet leader has left the capital for his summer vacation is often the arrival of paving crews on <LOCATION> Kutuzovsky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prospekt </LOCATION>, the route regularly traveled by the leader to and from the Kremlin. Traffic in both directions of <LOCATION> Kutuzovsky </LOCATION> is forced to the outer lanes when top officials or state guests travel the broad thoroughfare, while the privileged center lane is left clear for the VIPs. As the leader approaches, traffic lights along the route are switched to green by policemen who man the controls in miniature, glass-enclosed control towers overlooking the central streets. Most of the meetings between <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will take place within the heavily fortified <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>. Vehicles can enter only through two archways, with dozens of armed <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> guards in sight and others likely at the ready behind the historic fortress' crenelated russet walls. If <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> chooses to make an impromptu stop among the crowds of Soviets lined up along the streets to greet him, as <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> did during his <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> stay, the president's own <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agents will keep a wary eye on the flock of flag-waving welcomers. One of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agents was asked during the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> summit whether the superpowers' two squads of bodyguards are able to work well together. He replied that their work styles were so similar, `` It's like they're working out of our manual.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s bodyguards often resemble <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s in appearance as well as demeanor. The tall, well-dressed men, with their trim haircuts and tiny earphones connected to two-way radios, are quickly identifiable during the leader's televised talks with Soviet citizens. They encircle <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and face away from him, silently scanning the crowd for suspicious movement. Security has always been tight around the Soviet leader, but the net has pulled in even closer over the past two years. Rumors of an assassination attempt spread through the capital after <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON>, visited the southern <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Krasnodar </LOCATION> in September 1986. Both appeared on television a few days after their return looking tan and fit, but the number of bodyguards more than doubled at that time, and screenings of reporters and onlookers at public events intensified. Metal detectors are rarely used in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> but have been appearing recently as security for <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> appearances. And uniformed police at the entrances to virtually all public buildings closely check visitors' credentials and search purses and camera bags before permitting entry. When reporters are allowed into the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> for photo sessions or political meetings, they must clear a dozen security checkpoints before entering the room in which the session is to take place. During <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s visit to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, the routine will likely intensify as the Soviet hosts seek to preserve their image as a country rarely touched by terrorism.

 A flight mechanic who stole a private jet and killed himself after a 1,600-mile joyride was `` upbeat'' until the moment his radio went silent, says the pilot who talked him through a safe landing. `` I was shocked,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Cunningham </PERSON>, who helped his former co-worker, <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Christiansen </PERSON>, 24, land the plane at <LOCATION> Stapleton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> on Wednesday. `` The thing that stays in my mind is that he did take his life after all that.'' Within minutes of the relatively routine landing, police, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents and emergency crew members who approached the twin-engine Learjet 36a found <PERSON> Christiansen </PERSON> dead at the controls of a gunshot wound. `` As the crash crew and law enforcement personnel approached, he was ordered to lock his brakes,'' said <PERSON> Stapleton </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boulware </PERSON>. `` They heard a noise and when they looked in the cockpit, they found him dead. Things happened really fast.'' The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> have begun investigations to find out why <PERSON> Christiansen </PERSON> stole the 10-seat jet from <ORGANIZATION> Patrick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Henry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION> <LOCATION> News </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, why he killed himself, and where he obtained the gun. `` The indication was that he just wanted to fly around for awhile,'' <PERSON> Boulware </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Christiansen </PERSON>, who did not have pilot's license, worked as a flight mechanic at the <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> airport for the Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, which owned the plane he stole, officials said. The company operates the world's largest fleet of Learjets. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Daikos </PERSON>, spokesman for <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> airport, said <PERSON> Christiansen </PERSON> took off early Wednesday, clipping a security guard's van on a runway and shearing off part of a wingtip fuel tank The guard escaped injury. <PERSON> Cunningham </PERSON>, 42, who worked with <PERSON> Christiansen </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> last year, said he was preparing for a flight from <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> to his hometown of <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, when air traffic control officials asked for his help in landing the jet. `` He was upbeat on the radio, and responded readily. I asked him several times how he was doing, and he came back and said he was doing fine,'' said <PERSON> Cunningham </PERSON>. At one point, he asked <PERSON> Christiansen </PERSON> how he was and <PERSON> Christiansen </PERSON> replied, `` Feeling great.'' After <PERSON> Christiansen </PERSON> landed, <PERSON> Cunningham </PERSON> asked, `` Are you OK, <PERSON> Mike </PERSON>? <PERSON> Mike </PERSON>, are you OK? Have you got that thing shut down yet?'' There was no reply, and, <PERSON> Boulware </PERSON> said, <PERSON> Christiansen </PERSON> was found dead moments later. <PERSON> Christiansen </PERSON> apparently grew up in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> and attended <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerotech </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Broomfield </LOCATION> last year. He was certified by the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> to work on aircraft in June. International Jet officials said he worked as `` aircraft cleaner and helper'' for about 10 months, resigning in August to take a job with <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. In March, he moved to <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Cunningham </PERSON> recalled <PERSON> Christiansen </PERSON> as a `` very personable'' man, who sometimes acted as his chauffeur during his stops at <LOCATION> Stapleton </LOCATION>. `` I believe he was in school at the time, training to be a flight mechanic and that was on his mind, of course,'' <PERSON> Cunningham </PERSON> said. `` He did the job well, to my knowledge.'' <PERSON> Cunningham </PERSON> said he did not know why <PERSON> Christiansen </PERSON> stole the plane. `` We did n't have time to go into too much background,'' he said. `` We wanted to get the plane down safely.'' Attempts to reach <PERSON> Christiansen </PERSON>'s family members by telephone at the <LOCATION> Lakewood </LOCATION> address <PERSON> Christiansen </PERSON> gave the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> were unsuccessful. The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> made 30 calls to the apartment complex where he lived in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and found only one resident at home. She said she never had heard of him.

 The freewheeling Chinese city of <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION> is bucking a national trend of canceling beauty pageants by going ahead this week with a contest to select top models, a pro-Beijing newspaper reported today. About 5,000 people braved the rain and packed a city sports stadium Wednesday night to watch judges whittle a field of 30 men and women to a final 15 who will compete for the titles of `` Miss Canton'' and `` Mr. <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION>'' on Saturday, the Chinese-language <PERSON> Wen </PERSON> <PERSON> Wei </PERSON> <PERSON> Po </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> are among the Chinese cities to cancel planned beauty contests. Typically, local leaders have said `` conditions are not ripe'' for pageants in a country with a low standard of living. Authorities in <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> Guangdong </LOCATION> province just 90 miles from the British colony of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, decided to allow the completion of the `` <ORGANIZATION> Canton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Model </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Competition </ORGANIZATION>'' because it already is in its final phase. But the report said local media were instructed to play down the event and the organizing television station scrapped plans to televise the contest live. Provincial and city officials invited to the competition on Wednesday night also did not show up, the newspaper said. The report quoted members of the audience telling reporters that Cantonese people are able to accept beauty pageants because their area opened up to the outside world earlier than the rest of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The region is one of the country's most prosperous and has been relatively successful in attracting foreign investment.

 Industrialist <PERSON> Armand </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammer </PERSON> celebrated his 90th birthday at a <ORGANIZATION> Gala </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> concert which ended with Hammer conducting the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Symphony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orchestra </ORGANIZATION> in <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillip </PERSON> <PERSON> Sousa </PERSON>'s `` Stars and Stripes Forever.'' Music Director <PERSON> Mstislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostropovich </PERSON> handed over his baton Wednesday night moments after Hammer announced he was giving $ 250,000 to the orchestra. More than 3,000 well-wishers filled the center's Concert Hall to celebrate the birthday of the philanthropist, art collector and chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. During the concert, <PERSON> Hammer </PERSON> sat in the President's Box with his wife, <PERSON> Frances </PERSON>, and Soviet Ambassador <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubinin </PERSON> The audience included high-ranking government officials, members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, diplomats and leaders of the business and arts communities, as well as <PERSON> Lady </PERSON> <PERSON> Bird </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, widow of former President <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Baines </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. Mounting the stage after the concert, <PERSON> Hammer </PERSON> said his dream of creating `` a meaningful peace in the world is closer to reality than ever before.'' He predicted that the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit talks between President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will be a `` tremendous success.'' `` I believe the die has been cast for realistic negotiations that will lead to a new period of understanding and respect between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Hammer </PERSON> said. Hammer has been close to a long succession of Soviet leaders and has struck trade deals with the Soviets for many years. He also is chairman of the president's <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> and has spent millions of dollars on medical research aimed at finding a cancer cure. He proposed that a `` March of Dollars'' similar to the March of Dimes against polio begun 50 years ago be held to accelerate cancer research. He said he is lobbying congressional leaders to back matching government funds for $ 500 million in private money to be given to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> over four years. Hammer shared the stage with members of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Symphony </ORGANIZATION> and Wednesday night's guest artists: violinists <PERSON> Yehudi </PERSON> <PERSON> Menuhin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>, soprano <PERSON> Kiri </PERSON> <PERSON> Te </PERSON> <PERSON> Kanawa </PERSON> and Chinese pianist <PERSON> Yuhui </PERSON> <PERSON> Hong </PERSON>, who made her <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> debut at the concert.

 Let the rest of the country attack the stubborn weed with trowels and poisons. <PERSON> Adrian </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> prefers to grow his dandelions by the acre, then put them in cans so people can eat them. <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>, who owns a canning company that has been in the family for four generations, plans to ship 1,000 cases of dandelion greens this year from his little cannery in the western <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> foothills. <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>, who hates to see a thriving dandelion go to waste, talks about the plant with fondness, respect and knowledge. The roots, he explains, can be made into herbal tea; the bright, yellow blossoms can be pickled or made into wine and jelly; the leaves are excellent cooked or served fresh in salads. `` And the stem, you use that to siphon gas out of someone's car,'' <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> deadpans He admits he has grown weary of offers of dandelions from homeowners plagued by the hearty, prolific weeds. <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> sees dandelions' tendency to grow back after being snipped, a trait that frustrates gardeners, as another plus. Five days after the last batch of foot-high dandelions was harvested, new shoots appeared. <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>' W.S. <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> and Son cannery was founded 102 years ago by his grandfather, <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>. The barn-size factory also packages beans and cans beet greens and a vegetative delicacy known as fiddleheads. Fiddleheads, named for their deep-green stems that are gracefully curled a couple of inches from the ground before they sprout into ostrich ferns in swampy, northern woodlands in late spring, make up the bulk of the products bearing <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>' Belle of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> label. His only competition comes from canners in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, where fiddleheads also are popular. While fiddleheads are best known to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Englanders </LOCATION>, who gather them with ritualistic zeal in late spring, they have a few scattered devotees as far away as <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>, 52, also ships fiddleheads to fashionable restaurants in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, `` and I do a whale of a business in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>.'' The Four Seasons restaurant in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> serves 300 pounds of fresh fiddleheads a week in the spring, and features a soft shell crab and fiddlehead combination as one of its `` signature dishes,'' said purchaser <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Menge </PERSON>. `` It's a unique type of vegetable _ I do n't even know if you call it a vegetable,'' said <PERSON> Menge </PERSON>. `` It's got a wonderful flavor to me, sort of between a string bean and asparagus.'' <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> loves to eat fiddleheads, even though he ca n't quite pin down what gives them appeal. `` There is n't that much flavor to a fiddlehead,'' said <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>, who likes them salted and slathered with butter or served in one of his wife's fiddlehead quiches. `` To me, it tastes like a fiddlehead.'' <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>' company also pickles fiddleheads and dandelions. The harvest is now in full swing. While <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> cultivates and harvests the monstrous dandelions that grow in neat rows on his land, he hires up to 200 pickers, from children to a woman in her 70s, to gather the young ferns from secret patches all over <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, and in parts of <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> compared fiddlehead pickers to sport fishermen. `` When they find a good spot, they keep it a secret.'' This season, <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> expects to can at least 1,200 cases plus ship 15 tons of fresh fiddleheads to market. As the canning season peaked in late May, some cannery workers had been on the job for nearly 20 straight days. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON>, who trims the stems and cleans a brown, flaky skin from fiddleheads before they are washed, blanched and canned, said she has been working `` pretty near seven days a week.'' <PERSON> Adrian </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the 22-year-old manager of the plant and the fourth generation of the family of canners, said he had just finished working 22 straight 14-hour days when his wife gave birth to their first son. `` I'm tired as hell,'' he said as he loaded armfuls of fiddleheads into a bin for cleaning.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> today detonated its biggest nuclear test since 1985 in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>, exploding a bomb equivalent to 80,000 tons of dynamite, scientists said. The underground test, on Mururoa atoll, was the second this year and the 97th in a series started in 1975 when <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> abandoned atmospheric testing in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Warwick </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Seismological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observatory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Wellington </LOCATION>. Scientists at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>'s monitoring station in <LOCATION> Raratonga </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cooks </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, recorded the blast at 5:01 a.m. -LRB- 11:01 a.m. EDT Wednesday -RRB-, saying it was an 80-kiloton bomb. It was the largest French test on <LOCATION> Mururoa </LOCATION> since May 1985, when <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> detonated a 90-kiloton bomb. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> set off a 20-kiloton blast on <LOCATION> Mururoa </LOCATION> on May 12. Six more tests are expected this year. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> as a matter of policy does not comment on reports of its testing. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> condemned the latest test, noting the program is continuing against strong opposition from countries in the region. `` I am seriously concerned about continued <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> nuclear testing in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, who is also minister for disarmament. `` There can be no doubt that continued <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> nuclear testing in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> is disquieting to the region,'' he said in a statement. <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> said it was ironic that French testing had brought <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> countries closer together, culminating in a decision to declare the region a nuclear-free zone. He said it would be a `` profound relief'' to countries of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> if <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> signed protocols to the treaty and ceased testing.

 The Organization of African Unity marked its silver jubilee with a declaration promising more help for the military overthrow of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and the independence struggle in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. The declaration, released Wednesday, said the <ORGANIZATION> OAU </ORGANIZATION> would achieve such goals through a renewed commitment to `` unity, solidarity, liberation and development'' although it offered no new plans of action. Earlier Wednesday, President <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaunda </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>, the outgoing <ORGANIZATION> OAU </ORGANIZATION> chairman, celebrated the organization's 25th anniversary with a chorus of `` Happy Birthday, <ORGANIZATION> OAU </ORGANIZATION>,'' as he cut a cake. African leaders planted trees and unveiled a marble plaque with gold engraving of the organization's anniversay theme: Unity, Solidarity, Liberation, Development. Groups from <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> danced and sang. Security was light for the more than 30 heads of government and state gathered at the 50-member body's headquarters in the capital of <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION>. The celebration will be followed by a three-day summit beginning today. Many of the 40 points in the 11-page declaration repeated the original objectives of the <ORGANIZATION> OAU </ORGANIZATION>'s founding fathers, voiced in <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION> 25 years ago. The declaration highlighted a renewed commitment to bring about the early independence of <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, also known as <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, and to eradicate <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s policy of race segregation, called apartheid. <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> is under <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s control. The declaration reaffirmed `` the primacy of the armed struggle and resolve to increase financial, material and military assistance to the national liberation movemments.'' However, money might be a problem. Thirty-four of the organization's members owe the <ORGANIZATION> OAU </ORGANIZATION>'s liberation fund a total of $ 12 million. The declaration repeated a commitment to the imposition of comprehensive, mandatory sanctions against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s white-led government and urged international support for such sanctions. It did not say, however, how it would impose the sanctions on many of its members who do about $ 1 billion of trade each year with the apartheid state. The declaration noted with grave concern continued acts of aggression by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> against its neighbors and reaffirmed the <ORGANIZATION> OAU </ORGANIZATION>'s commitment to provide financial and material help to strengthen their defenses. The declaration also expressed support for recent Angolan peace talks involving top officials of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>.

 Midway through the 15-day strike wave that ended this month, tentative agreement was at hand for the communist leadership's architect of economic reform to meet with Solidarity chief <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>. But the promise of the first direct contact in six years between prominent opposition leaders and authorities went unfulfilled when <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> joined a strike at the Lenin shipyard in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>. Now, there are signs such talks may actually be in the offing. The `` thread of dialogue'' may actually have a better chance because of the strikes, <PERSON> Ryszard </PERSON> <PERSON> Wojna </PERSON>, a leading communist deputy in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, was quoted as saying in this week's issue of the official newspaper Odrodzenie -LRB- Rebirth -RRB-. Senior communist leaders are encouraging talk of an `` anti-crisis pact'' by which the opposing camps would agree on and unite behind a program to breathe life into a lethargic economy. The idea was raised by historian <PERSON> Bronislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Geremek </PERSON>, a close adviser to <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, in an interview published in February by the official press. Publication of an interview with such a prominent opposition figure was in itself an unusual event. Spurring the renewed search for dialogue is the sense that the impasse that has prevailed since a 1981 military crackdown on the Solidarity independent labor federation can not continue forever. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s economic crisis is especially acute and the government's attempt to institute reforms has won scant public support. Authorities have raised prices 45 percent this year and say they plan to reduce central management of the economy and encourage more free enterprise. But, according to one recent public opinion poll, just 7 percent of the public believes the program will succeed. A pact on reform with the opposition, which demands a voice in shaping it, could improve its chances and encourage the assistance of Western lenders. Although it is not clear who would speak to whom, the idea for an `` anti-crisis pact'' appears to be gaining advocates within official circles. And <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said on Tuesday that the idea is being considered by Solidarity. Earlier this month, Politburo member <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Miodowicz </PERSON>, leader of the official unions created after Solidarity was outlawed in 1982, said he would not rule out meeting <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> if it would improve the public mood. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> last met with a senior government official during his post-martial law internment in March 1982. <PERSON> Wojna </PERSON> said in the Odrodzenie interview that he envisioned that Deputy Prime Minister <PERSON> Zdzislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadowski </PERSON>, the government's architect of reform, and a team of party economic experts would meet with a dozen or so opposition representatives. <PERSON> Wojna </PERSON> said such a meeting could be successful if `` all propaganda, demagogy and mutual prejudices'' were left in the cloakroom. He said the canceled meeting of <PERSON> Sadowski </PERSON> and <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> had represented a `` thin thread -LRB- of dialogue -RRB-, but still it indicated the direction of thinking.'' <PERSON> Sadowski </PERSON>'s spokesman, <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Malkowski </PERSON>, said on Wednesday that <PERSON> Sadowski </PERSON>'s attitude toward such a meeting is `` still the same _ open.'' And chief government spokesman <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Urban </PERSON> told his weekly news conference on Tuesday that `` one certainly can expect further active striving for talks and cooperation'' with the opposition. Asked specifically about a meeting between <PERSON> Sadowski </PERSON> and <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, he said it was not possible at present but, `` The future will show how it will go.'' From his home in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> responded: `` I have said that they would come to us on their knees. And they will, sooner or later. My problem now is whether I should wait until they do or not.'' Reinstatement of independent Solidarity locals was a key demand by participants in most of the five major strikes that began April 25 and ended May 10. It was championed with the greatest vigor by strikers at the <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> shipyard, who ended their stoppage peacefully but without resolution, and the <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> steelworks outside <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION>, whose strike security forces crushed. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> is afflicted with a $ 39 billion foreign debt, climbing inflation, low wages and lack of capital to overhaul its outmoded industrial plant. The government's economic reform progam aims to decrease bureaucracy, encourage private and managerial enterprise, reduce central planning and make the economy more market-oriented. But implementation has been slow. Solidarity supports the program's direction, but says it is doomed to fail unless the government enters a dialogue with opposition groups. Three times in postwar <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, price increases have led to labor unrest that has toppled governments.

 <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s defense attorney says he's surprised that lawyers were able to find enough acceptable jurors for the ousted governor's criminal trial A 24-member panel was made final Wednesday after two days of juror questioning in <ORGANIZATION> Maricopa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. This afternoon, prosecution and defense lawyers were to eliminate six members each to assemble the final eight-member jury with four alternates. Opening statements were scheduled for June 2 in the trial of the former governor and his brother, <PERSON> Willard </PERSON>, on charges of concealing a $ 350,000 campaign loan. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> defense lawyer <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said he was surprised that enough acceptable panelists were found because of the extensive publicity surrounding the case. `` I really did n't know what to expect,'' <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said. The jurors and alternates are to be sworn in Friday, <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dann </PERSON> ruled. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> could face up to 22 years in prison if convicted of all six felony counts of perjury, willful concealment and filing false documents. <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, who was his brother's 1986 campaign treasurer, faces three similar counts and up to 9 -LCB- years in prison if convicted. The former <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> governor was removed from office April 4 when the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> convicted him on two unrelated impeachment counts. He also had been impeached in connection with the $ 350,000 loan, but the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> did not hear that charge for fear of prejudicing his criminal trial. Thirteen of 37 possible jurors questioned during two days were eliminated for showing signs of bias or personal conflicts. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, asked whether he was pleased with the jury pool, joked that he would have liked to include several of those who were eliminated, but he declined to comment further. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> and his brother have denied all wrongdoing in their failure to list the $ 350,000 loan from a <LOCATION> Tempe </LOCATION> developer on financial reports required by the state. They contended it was properly reported as part of a $ 465,000 lump sum listed as a contribution from <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>. On June 1, the <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> is to hear oral arguments on a defense motion to return the charges to the state grand jury for a new determination of probable causee. Among the jurors struck from the pool by the prosecutor was a woman who said Tuesday she thought <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s personality was one of `` arrogance, of sureness of himself'' and that he had an inability to admit error. One woman accepted for the panel said she believed <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> was honest, adding, `` I like the man. I had nothing against him as governor.''

<TEXT>
 The dollar closed moderately higher today against the Japanese yen in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> following its overnight advance in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, while share prices fell back to remain little changed after an initial surge in early trading. After opening at 124.35 yen, up 0.05 yen from Wednesday's finish, the dollar climbed further, closing the day at 124.50 yen, up 0.20 yen `` The dollar stayed in narrow range from 124.35 to 124.53 yen, sandwiched between buying and selling orders by speculators,'' said a foreign exchange dealer at a major commercial bank, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Participants stayed away from placing major orders in anticipation of the release of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> first-quarter gross national product figures due out later in the day, he said. On the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION> of 225 selected issues slipped a modest 15.41 points, or 0.05 percent, to end the day's trading at 27,428.24. `` The market made a good start on the two consecutive rallies led by large-capital issues, such as steels and heavy industries. But it soon lost the strength as investors turned to selling to take profits,'' said a stock analyst with a major securities house, speaking anonymously. Activity slowed in the afternoon session as trading in large-capital issues tailed off, and the market lost ground steadily throughout most of the remaining day, traders said. The Nikkei index had gained 207.84 points to 27,641.49 early in the morning session. On Tuesday and Wednesday the stock market's key barometer had gained a total of 193.89 points Among the losers were steels, non-ferrous metals and electricals. Drugs and textiles, as well as securities and insurances also lost ground. Certain machineries and papers were bought. Volume on the first section was estimated at 1.1 billion shares, down from the 1.5 billion shares which changed hands on Wednesday.

He was 87. <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, who died Tuesday, founded the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> publishing house <ORGANIZATION> Hamish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hamilton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> in 1931.

<HEAD>Safety Commission to Ban Most Lawn Darts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Consumer Product Safety Commission has voted to ban most lawn darts, saying the pointed metal toys present a danger of death or serious injury. Lawn darts, which have long metal tips, have become popular as a yard game. They are tossed through the air, with the player trying to sticking the points into the ground in or near a target. Three children, aged 4, 7 and 13, have been killed in accidents involving the darts in recent years, according to commission records. In addition, an estimated 670 lawn-dart injuries are treated annually at hospital emergency rooms. The ban, voted Wednesday, now goes back to the commission staff to develop a formal rulemaking to enforce the ban and to solicit comment from the public before being returned to the commissioners for a vote on a final ban, likely in late summer or fall.

 Proposed deep cuts in <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s budget could kill <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s space station, reducing the nation to a second - or third-rate space power, the space agency's head warns `` Without the space station, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manned space flight program would be dead-ended, and <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s leadership in space would be put on hold indefinitely,'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> said Wednesday as he spoke to a group of reporters attending briefings on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> space goals. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has asked <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to give <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> $ 11.5 billion in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, an increase of 27 percent over the current budget. However, key lawmakers have said the agency can expect no more than $ 10.7 billion. A <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> budget resolution would slash that to $ 10.2 billion. The administration has asked for $ 967 million to continue space station development. Earlier cuts already have delayed the program three years. Current plans call for putting people in the orbiting laboratory in late 1995. <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON>, speaking from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said that if the budget were reduced to $ 10.2 billion, `` <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> would have to recommend killing the space station.'' The result, he said, could be reduction of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` to a second-rate or even a third-rate power in space.'' <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> said the station is needed to support space research and to prepare humans for deeper excursions into space, perhaps to build a moon base or to mount an expedition to <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION>. Asked how much money it would take to continue the space station next year, the administrator replied, `` The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> has reported out $ 900 million. Unless we get close to that figure, I wonder if it would be worth going ahead with the space station.'' <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> said most members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> favor a strong space program, `` but when it comes to balancing the space station with their favorite programs in the present budget climate, it is a hard choice to make.'' He said cancellation of the space station would have a `` devastating'' effect on the space programs of the Europeans and the Canadians, who have invested $ 1 billion, and are planning to double that, to develop modules and other equipment for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> facility. <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> said a steep budget reduction would also lead to a drop in the number of space shuttle flights after launches resume, now scheduled for late August. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> plans seven launches next year, building up to 14 a year by 1994. He said the Soviets have been gathering valuable flight experience over several years with their Salyut space station and with the new Mir station. `` There is no doubt the Russians are far ahead of us in moving out into space,'' <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Computer Whiz Kid Hospitalized With Mother After Assets Seized</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A 24-year-old computer whiz and his mother apparently tried to commit suicide after authorities closed the budding millionaire's company and seized its assets, police say. <PERSON> Tex </PERSON> <PERSON> Zachary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hildreth </PERSON> and his 50-year-old mother, <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>, were in serious condition today at <LOCATION> Elliot </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, said nursing supervisor <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hildreth </PERSON> left the <LOCATION> Braintree </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, area just before his 5-year-old computer services company, <ORGANIZATION> Massdata </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, was closed by authorities and its assets were seized Tuesday. He left behind about 30 angry employees and irked investors. <PERSON> Hildreth </PERSON> was arrested as a fugitive here Tuesday after a Holiday Inn employee called police to report a bloodied man wandering in the lobby. Police found <PERSON> Hildreth </PERSON>'s mother lying injured in the room the two shared. Police Lt. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bovaird </PERSON> said it appeared <PERSON> Hildreth </PERSON> may have slashed his wrists. A bottle of non-prescription pills was found in the hotel room, along with what appeared to be suicide notes, <PERSON> Bovaird </PERSON> said. Both Hildreths were incoherent, the lieutenant said. <PERSON> Massdata </PERSON> was closed Monday when the <ORGANIZATION> Rockland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which was owed more than $ 400,000, tried to seize its assets, said Senior Vice President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, authorities and state police secured <PERSON> Massdata </PERSON>'s offices Tuesday night. The county district attorney's office began investigating <PERSON> Hildreth </PERSON> on Tuesday after receiving complaints from several people who said they did business with him, said spokesman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> McGorty </PERSON>. Police in the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Weymouth </LOCATION> charged <PERSON> Hildreth </PERSON> with larceny of more than $ 250 on the same day after receiving another complaint, <PERSON> McGorty </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hildreth </PERSON> collapsed in his office on his 24th birthday May 18, suffering what was described as an aneurysm, a dangerous weakening of a blood vessel. His father died of an aneurysm when <PERSON> Hildreth </PERSON> was 7. Employees became suspicious last Friday when <PERSON> Massdata </PERSON>'s president told them their paychecks were being withheld because <PERSON> Hildreth </PERSON> had not signed them <PERSON> McGorty </PERSON> said the investigation into <PERSON> Hildreth </PERSON>'s business dealings was expected to be lengthy. But there were signs of unusual behavior before this week. The <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> reported Wednesday that <PERSON> Hildreth </PERSON> often tried to trick employees into believing that <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> real estate tycoon <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> called to chat. Employees said <PERSON> Hildreth </PERSON> would disguise his voice and call himself, pretending to be <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, then would leave the office door open as he conducted an imaginary conversation. <PERSON> Hildreth </PERSON> transformed himself from an overweight, unhappy teen-ager into a budding millionaire just a few years out of high school, according to a profile last month in The <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION>. After buying his first computer at age 16, he began writing computer programs. The confidence he gained prompted him to lose 115 pounds in less than two years. With the help of a mentor in the <LOCATION> Braintree </LOCATION> area, <PERSON> Hildreth </PERSON> rented office space at the age of 20 and went into business as a computer consultant. He gradually built up his business, hiring young computer experts from other companies. <PERSON> Hildreth </PERSON> rapidly acquired symbols of success: a $ 220,000 <LOCATION> Weymouth </LOCATION> condominium, a $ 32,000 BMW and a 50-inch, $ 4,000 color TV. His mother, who once lived with him in subsidized housing and worked as a lunch matron at his school, was made clerk of the company. The company had more than 300 clients, an employee told the <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>. Massdata turned profitable in 1987 and predicted sales of about $ 4 million this year, the <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> said. Last November, <PERSON> Hildreth </PERSON>, accompanied by a beautiful woman, arrived in a limousine for the fifth reunion of his <ORGANIZATION> Braintree </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> class. `` This was my revenge for four years of hell,'' he said at the time.

<HEAD>LA County Approves Plan for Nation's First Fully Automated Trolley</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Transportation officials in this traffic-clogged region have approved a 20-mile railway they say would be the nation's first fully automated, driverless trolley line. The <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> unanimously adopted the proposal Wednesday despite a critic's contention that the system would be `` bureaucrat-friendly, technology-friendly but not user-friendly.'' `` What turned me around was other successful -LRB- automated -RRB- systems'' that have worked `` astoundingly well,' said Commissioner <PERSON> Jacki </PERSON> <PERSON> Bacharach </PERSON>, who heads the commission's rail construction committee and has studied such lines in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lille </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. Commission Chairman <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Schabarum </PERSON> said the automated system is `` a technology whose time has come,'' and he called for `` a commitment for automation throughout the system from now on.'' The project requires a $ 50 million investment above the $ 344 million that was originally estimated for the 20-mile line along the Century Freeway between <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Segundo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Norwalk </LOCATION>, which is about 10 miles southeast of downtown <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. Until recently, the commission had intended to use manually controlled trolleys, which would be powered by overhead wires. Commissioner <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Grabinski </PERSON> said the new system will be the first fully automated, driverless trolley line in the country. Proponents say the driverless system would prove more efficient by running smaller trains more often and save money by replacing highly paid operators with lower-paid attendants who would roam the cars. `` More frequent service all day long builds ridership and farebox revenue,'' Ms. <PERSON> Bacharach </PERSON> said. Critics, however, said the automated trolleys would be the third type of rail car to become part of the county's multibillion dollar mass transit system, along with cars to be used for the <ORGANIZATION> Metro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rail </ORGANIZATION> subway now under construction and a manned light rail system proposed between <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. None of the cars would be compatible and riders would be forced to transfer. For example, a commuter going from the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fernando </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> would have to ride four lines and transfer three times. `` As long as they design it so you have to get on and get off, it's never going to be user-friendly,'' said state Assemblyman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Katz </PERSON>. `` This is a system that is bureacrat-friendly, technology-friendly but not user-friendly.'' However, the compatibility of the trolley with other transit systems was not viewed as a problem by the commission, said <PERSON> Erica </PERSON> <PERSON> Goebel </PERSON>, a commission spokeswoman. `` Passenger studies show that passengers who have to transfer from one line to another do n't consider that as any kind of a barrier,'' Ms. <PERSON> Goebel </PERSON> said. `` It's all part of the ride.''

The radicals were forced out during a police siege of the shrine. The siege, from May 9 to 18, resulted in the surrender of more than 200 extremists and sympathizers. More than 46 people died in the ordeal. There had been frequent reports that people were being detained and tortured by militants inside the shrine. Several people were reported missing by families after they went to the temple to pray. The bodies found today were buried near the dining hall that stands to the east of the temple. On Wednesday, the bodies were found to the west of the temple. Sikhs, whose religion was formed 500 years ago as an alternative to <LOCATION> Hinduism </LOCATION> and Islam, claim they are discriminated against by <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s majority Hindus. More than 1,150 people have been killed by Sikh extremists in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> state since the start of the year. In 1987, 1,030 people were killed. Indian security forces raided the <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> in 1984, killing 1,200 people, mostly Sikhs.

<HEAD>Study Suggests Autism Results From Prenatal Brain Development
Error</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An unfortunate mixup in the growth of the brain before birth may be responsible for autism, according to research published today. Researchers who made scans of victims' brains found that one structure buried deep within the head is often poorly developed. While this may not be the sole cause of autism, it could help explain many of the weird and stubborn symptoms of this illness. Dr. <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Courchesne </PERSON> and colleagues from <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> pinpointed the abnormality in a region of the cerebellum, which lies at the base of the skull. This structure helps control movement, learning and some kinds of behavior. `` It supports the idea that this is something that happens early in development,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Bauman </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. Autism usually becomes apparent early in childhood. Victims are withdrawn and often mute. Frequently they move and walk oddly, become obsessed with mechanical objects and are overly sensitive to sounds and other distractions. The disorder occurs in about five of every 10,000 people. <PERSON> Courchesne </PERSON>, whose study was published in the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>, that in some people with autism, a part of the cerebellum known as the vermis is undersized. He studied 18 people, and in 14 of them, the vermis was 25 percent smaller than usual. He said he believes that the defect exists in a majority of autistic people and probably occurs before birth as the brain takes shape inside the womb. `` Until this study, it was unknown whether or not autism had an anatomical or chemical basis,'' <PERSON> Courchesne </PERSON> said. `` This kind of evidence makes it clear that at least in a substantial subset of autism, the disorder is, in fact, anatomical.'' If the newly found abnormality turns out to be a cause of autism, the discovery could open new approaches for treating the disorder, which is incurable. However, many experts believe that autism is actually a group of similar-looking diseases, so no single problem is likely to explain all cases of the disorder. `` This is potentially a very important finding, because it would represent a way to assist the diagnosis and also has implications as to what might be the cause and the timing of the insult to the brain,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritvo </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Courchesne </PERSON> said the defect he discovered could be just one of many injuries suffered by the brains of autistic people before birth. If so, it might not be the key injury that underlies autism. However, he said, `` It is possible that this damage is responsible for some of the symptoms of autism. The cerebellum is in a position to disrupt or affect mechanisms involved in attention and various kinds of learning and to alter the activity of several major neurotransmitter systems'' of brain chemicals. The researchers used magnetic resonance scanning, which produces cross-section pictures of the head, to pinpoint the difference between autistic brains and those of normal people. <PERSON> Bauman </PERSON> said the defect that <PERSON> Courchesne </PERSON> found is too subtle for scanning to be used routinely to diagnose autism. She and <PERSON> Ritvo </PERSON> also have found abnormalities in specific cells called Purkinje cells in the brain's of autism victims after death. `` I think the cerebellum is playing a role,'' she said. `` But I think there are other parts of the brain that are also involved, such as the limbic system, which has something to do with memory. I hope people will not say that the problem is now solved.'' In an accompanying editorial, Drs. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Volkmar </PERSON> and <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> called the report `` particularly interesting.'' But they cautioned that the number of patients tested was small, and their brain defect might not be typical of autism victims.

 The Soviet navy operates close to home in part because the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> does not trust its sailors and fears defections by naval personnel, according to the editor of the new `` <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>'s Fighting Ships. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharpe </PERSON> also said the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> is so much stronger than <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s forces that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is finding it harder and harder to work with its allies at sea. The new edition of the prestigious reference book was released Wednesday. <PERSON> Sharpe </PERSON>, a recently retired <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> captain, recalled passing a Soviet cruiser in the English Channel. He said that while almost the entire crew of the British warship lined its decks, on the Soviet vessel just one young sailor was visible above deck. `` I do n't think the Politburo trusts its navy and that is one of the reasons why we see so few ships of the Soviet fleet ranging the waters of the world,'' <PERSON> Sharpe </PERSON> said. He also said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> keeps its navy bottled up because <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> sees its fleet as fulfilling an essentially defensive role. Indeed, this hypothesis is now so widely accepted that the latest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> naval policy envisages entering Soviet home waters during a war, said <PERSON> Sharpe </PERSON>. But despite such a `` visibly wimpish Soviet policy at sea,'' the Soviet fleet is capable of a `` swift breakout into the vulnerable sea lanes of the Western world,'' he said. Pointing to the recent buildup of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> naval forces, <PERSON> Sharpe </PERSON> called the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> `` rejuvenated and formidable.'' But he said such improvements have made coordination with <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s weaker allies more difficult. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is more and more operating on its own and is going to find it harder and harder to ally with the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> forces on this side of the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Sharpe </PERSON> told a news conference on Tuesday. In times of trouble, <PERSON> Sharpe </PERSON> said, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> would probably not wait to consult with <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and `` subordinate itself to a polyglot talking shop of the <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> variety.'' <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> is the headquarters of the 16-nation <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Sharpe </PERSON> noted <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> commanders publicly deny a go-it-alone policy. But he maintained this policy is what has developed because of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> naval superiority and slow decision-making by <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>. Every navy now operates `` in the shadow'' of the huge fleets of the superpowers, he said. But despite Soviet naval advances, including development of quieter submarines, <PERSON> Sharpe </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> still has the edge because of its better-trained personnel.

<HEAD>Protein Defect Found in Muscular Dystrophy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The protein deficiency that triggers a rare form of muscular dystrophy has been pinpointed, according to a study that an expert called a `` key victory'' in finding the causes of the crippling disease of children. The research was conducted by Dr. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunkel </PERSON> and colleagues at <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and reported in today's New England Journal of Medicine. They found that the disorder is caused by problems with the muscle protein called dystrophin. <PERSON> Becker </PERSON> muscular dystrophy results if the body produces too little of the protein or makes an abnormal form of it. `` We've scored another key victory in uncovering the causes of muscular dystrophy, learning what must be set right to cure these devastating diseases,'' said Dr. <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mouchly </PERSON> <PERSON> Small </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Muscular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dystrophy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. In December, <PERSON> Kunkel </PERSON> and his colleagues reported that a more common form of the disease, called <PERSON> Duchenne </PERSON>'s musclar dystrophy, occurs when the protein is absent. Two years ago, <PERSON> Kunkel </PERSON>'s team reported the discovery of the gene responsible for <PERSON> Duchenne </PERSON>'s and <PERSON> Becker </PERSON> muscular dystrophy. <PERSON> Duchenne </PERSON>'s muscular dystrophy occurs in one in 3,300 births, while <PERSON> Becker </PERSON> muscular dystrophy strikes one in 30,000 births. Both forms strike males almost exclusively and result in progressive weakness and wasting of the muscles. The protein abnormalities in both forms result from an inborn genetic defect. Genes contain the code that instruct the body to make all the proteins necessary for life.

 Students threw firebombs and rocks at an American bank today, farmers opposing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> imports battled riot police, and Prime Minister <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyun-jai </PERSON> ordered a crackdown on anti-American protests. Police said four people were arrested when 30 students dashed out of sidestreets and hurled rocks and about 10 firebombs at a branch in southern <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> of the <LOCATION> Koram </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. The bank, a joint venture between the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> and Korean business groups, had not yet opened for business and had shutters over its windows and entrance. It was not damaged. Shouting `` Go home <ORGANIZATION> Yankees </ORGANIZATION>'' and other slogans, the students scattered leaflets calling for `` independent, democratic'' reunification with <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. It was the first attack on an American business in a wave of violent anti-U.S. protests in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> and other cities during the past week. Radical students blame the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for the partition of the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> peninsula and accuse <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> of supporting military rule in the south. They demand the withdrawal of the 42,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops stationed in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> under a mutual defense pact. Last week protesters hurled rocks and firebombs at American cultural centers in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> and the southern city of <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> and threw homemade bombs at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. Up to a dozen police and students were hurt in the attacks, but no <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> personnel was injured. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet troops split the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> peninsula when the Japanese occupation ended in 1945 at the end of World War II. The two Koreas _ the pro-Western south and the communist north _ are bitter opponents. Riot police fired tear gas to disperse 500 farmers trying to march into the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> building in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> today. The farmers were protesting plans to increase imports of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agricultural products. In some rural areas police scuffled with groups of farmers staging similar protests. At least five people, including an opposition lawmaker, were injured. The farmers, accompanied by two calves, hurled cow dung, burned an effigy of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and used clubs to fight police. Police in green combat fatigues and black helmets kicked and punched farmers. The protest in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> lasted two hours, with farmers shouting `` Oppose American beef and its pressure to open the Korean market'' and other anti-U.S. slogans. At one point, a calf ran amok through the 1,000 riot police surrounding the assembly compound before being grabbed by police. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is pushing <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to widen its domestic markets to American imports to redress <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>'s $ 10 billion trade surplus with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The trade issue has fanned anti-U.S. sentiment and dissidents charge the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> disregards the wishes of the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> people with `` coercive'' demands. Prime Minister <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, in a Cabinet meeting today, called for tight security to guard foreign legations and public facilites from violence by radicals. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said the recent wave of violent protests posed a threat to the people and `` inflicted undesirable influence on the nation's security and diplomacy before staging the Olympics. The Olympic Games open in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> in September.

<HEAD>General Says 100,300 Soldiers In Afghanistan Before Withdrawal</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A senior Soviet general today provided for the first time a count of Soviet troop strength in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, saying 100,300 soldiers were deployed there before the contingent began to withdraw on May 15. The number provided by Marshal <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Akhromeyev </PERSON>, chief of the Soviet military general staff and a first deputy defense minister, was nearly 15,000 less than claimed by Western intelligence sources. <PERSON> Akhromeyev </PERSON> provided the figure the day after Gen. <PERSON> Alexei </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lizichev </PERSON>, another leading ministry official, provided a casualty count for the first time _ 13,310 Soviet soldiers killed in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, 35,478 wounded and 311 missing. <PERSON> Lizichev </PERSON> had refused to provide a figure for the size of the Soviet force. <PERSON> Akhromeyev </PERSON>, asked at a news conference on U.S.-Soviet relations about the size of the Soviet force in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, said: `` The contingent in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> as of May 15 numbered 100,300.'' He said 9,500 soldiers had left the country since the withdrawal began. The size of the Soviet force in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> has been estimated for years by Western intelligence sources at about 115,000 soldiers. But earlier this spring, Italian officials who met with First Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Yuli </PERSON> <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON> quoted him as putting troop strength there at 100,000. Soviet troops entered <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979, replaced one Communist government with another and remained to help fight anti-Marxist guerrillas. Under an agreement signed in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> on April 14, all Soviet troops are to be out of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> within nine months.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An `` accident of history'' made him mayor for a week. But now <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> is facing the reality of politics. Just a day after his photograph was unveiled on City Hall's `` Wall of Mayors,'' <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> was dumped Wednesday as vice mayor by the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> on a 31-15 vote The action was apparently a retaliation for his demands for better accounting among Council members. <PERSON> Orr </PERSON>, 43, a Democrat known as a strong proponent of ethics legislation, was thrust into the spotlight as acting mayor when <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> died of a heart attack Nov. 25. <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> held the mayor's job just seven days before the council, in a raucous, all-night session, elected <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> to succeed <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> had not sought the post. But in presiding over that council meeting, <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> angered some <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> supporters who thought he delayed calling for a vote. His support in the council continued to erode as council members objected to his persistent call for more controls over the way they spend their money. In Monday's <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> repeated his view that council members should be more accountable for their $ 18,000 continency funds and for their travel and office expenses. Currently, they are not required to disclose how that money is spent. `` Everything he has done ... has been done to demean us, to make us out to be thieves, ignoramuses and low-lifes,'' fumed Alderwoman <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Langford </PERSON>. `` He has to tell us how to run the council.'' <PERSON> Orr </PERSON>, however, said he will continue to push for accountability despite his ouster. `` This is only going to invigorate me,'' he said. `` I'm absolutely convinced that the majority of the people of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> support me ... In some ways, I'm honored to be dumped by some of these folks.'' <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> said he did n't know whether <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>, also a Democrat, actively supported his ouster but added that he believes the current administration is weak. <PERSON> Alderman </PERSON> <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabinski </PERSON> was named to succeed <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> as vice mayor, a post considered mainly ceremonial. <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> taught history and urban affairs at <ORGANIZATION> Mundelein </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> before he defeated three challengers to win election to the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> in 1979. His support for ethics legislation matched the agenda of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, who made him vice mayor in 1986 as <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> began building his council base. Being mayor, <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> said, was `` kind of an accident of history, and I'm really proud of what I did.'' `` I fought for religious and racial tolerance and <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> accountability,'' he said. <PERSON> Orr </PERSON>'s ouster came a day after his photograph was unveiled on the `` Wall of Mayors'' outside <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>'s fifth-floor office. `` He still was mayor,'' <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> told reporters when asked why <PERSON> Orr </PERSON>'s picture should join the honored group. `` It is extremely well-deserved. ... What's fair is fair.''

 Flooding in three provinces in southern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has killed 117 people and injured nearly 500, an official report said today. The disaster has rendered thousands homeless and isolated hundreds of thousands. The death toll from flooding in <LOCATION> Fujian </LOCATION> province has reached 82, with 436 people injured and five missing, the English-language <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> reported. A front-page photograph shows basketball hoops just above water-level at the playground of the No. 2 <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jianyang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, an especially hard-hit area. In neighboring <LOCATION> Jiangxi </LOCATION> province, three people died and 60 were injured Friday and Saturday, while 32 died in <LOCATION> Hunan </LOCATION> province, to the west of <LOCATION> Jiangxi </LOCATION>, in flooding from three days of rain that ended Saturday, the paper said. The <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> report was the first to mention flooding in <LOCATION> Hunan </LOCATION> province and to give a death toll for the flooding in <LOCATION> Jiangxi </LOCATION>. More than 730,000 people in <LOCATION> Fujian </LOCATION> province have been trapped by the floods, which also damaged 56,750 homes and wiped out 860 bridges and 1,550 irrigation works, said <PERSON> Yao </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaoyu </PERSON>, deputy chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>' relief bureau. Farmers have lost about 5,500 pounds of grain, 700 head of livestock and more than 50,000 chicken and other fowl, the paper said.

<HEAD>AIDS Test Ordered for Convicted Sex Offender</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A judge ordered a convicted sex offender to submit to a test for the AIDS virus over the objections of the man's attorney, who called it an invasion of privacy. Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gombiner </PERSON> said he would advise client <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Farmer </PERSON> not to comply with the order by <ORGANIZATION> King </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, and said he would appeal. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> ruled Tuesday that Farmer, 34, should receive the test before sentencing June 7. The former flight attendant was convicted last month of two counts of patronizing a teen-age male prostitute and two counts of sexual exploitation of a minor. Deputy prosecutor <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> said that if the test is positive, she would seek a 10-year sentence for Farmer. The normal maximum sentence for the crime is three years and seven months. Ms. <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> contended Farmer knew he had tested positive for the virus that can cause AIDS when he had contact with young male prostitutes. She said that if Farmer resists the order, she will seek a warrant to take the blood by force in the county jail. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said the test results would be supplied only to the court and to lawyers. `` It is a patently illegal order,'' said <PERSON> Gombiner </PERSON>. `` If your honor wants to hold us in contempt, you can, but I am telling Mr. <PERSON> Farmer </PERSON> he is not to comply with this order.'' He said the ruling violated Farmer's right to privacy, especially in light of a state law enacted this year that restricts such examinations. `` There is no God-given right for the state to go around sticking needles in people and taking out little vials of blood,'' <PERSON> Gombiner </PERSON> said. He said he would ask the state <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> to stay <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s order and review the ruling. AIDS, which damages the body's immune system and leaves victims susceptible to infections and cancer, is spread through sexual contact. It is also spread through needles or syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products, and from pregnant women to their offspring.

<HEAD>Soviet Artists Match West In Lively Paintings</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An exhibition of works by 34 Soviet artists that is touring <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> shows Russian painters are doing work as lively, innovative _ and often as strange _ as anything done in the West. The 35 paintings, which will be sold in July at the first international art auction in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> since the 1917 Russian revolution, are being shown in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to attract bidders. `` The tour and the sale introduce the excellence of modern Soviet painting to Western collectors, as well as offering more familiar works of the avant-garde period that followed the revolution,'' said <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Pury </PERSON>, managing director of the 23 European offices of <PERSON> Sotheby </PERSON>'s auction house. The works were shown in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> earlier this month and have just been displayed at <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION>'s in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> for three days. They will be seen in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> today and Friday, in <LOCATION> Cologne </LOCATION> May 31-June 3 and in <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION> June 9-15, before returning to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. In one painting, by <PERSON> Ilya </PERSON> <PERSON> Glazunov </PERSON>, a glowing scene depicts an old <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> city with monks and onion-shaped church domes surmounted by modern buildings and a red-flag procession. Another, by <PERSON> Svetlana </PERSON> <PERSON> Kopystianskaya </PERSON>, is comprised of a blue crumpled cloth in a box, mysteriously titled `` Dialogue: N. 2. <PERSON> Ilya </PERSON> <PERSON> Kabakov </PERSON> paints words on his canvases. One of his works titled `` Where Are You?'' consists of 36 sheets of paper with words on them, each page signed and dated and contained in a box. From 1928, when dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> achieved supreme power, there were two kinds of Soviet art: the official one that glorified the state and the unofficial one which did n't and was practiced behind the scenes. `` Under the new policy ... the distinction between ` official' and ` unofficial' art is no longer being made by the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Culture </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Pury </PERSON> said He helped select the works for auction after getting to know the artists during <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> visits to arrange loans of pictures when he was curator of <PERSON> Baron </PERSON> <PERSON> Heinrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Thyssen-Bornemisza </PERSON>'s famous picture collection in <LOCATION> Lugano </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. The auction was negotiated with the Soviet culture ministry by <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> <PERSON> Gowrie </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and a former arts minister and art dealer. Most of the sale works are in the $ 3,700 to $ 9,300 price range. A few run up to $ 22,000 to $ 28,000. There is a strong emphasis on abstraction and fractured images in the pictures, but there are also portraits and dreamy views of the land and cities. The <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> showing drew a large number of viewers. `` Some of our visitors asked if we had been taken over by the Russians,'' said a <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION>'s receptionist as a banner with the firm's name in Cyrillic letters was taken down from the building.

 Israeli fighter-bombers and helicopter gunships attacked Shiite Moslem guerrilla bases in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> today, hours after rocketing Palestinian positions near <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>, police said. Smoke billowed from the hills overlooking the southern villages of <LOCATION> Lowaizeh </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mleekh </LOCATION> as jets and gunships struck in three bombing, rocketing and strafing sorties starting at 8 a.m. The Israeli army confirmed the new raid in a brief communique that said Israeli planes attacked targets southwest of <LOCATION> Lowaizeh </LOCATION>. The pilots reported accurate hits and returned safely to base. Police in <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION> said they had no immediate report of casualties from the two villages about 15 miles north of the Israeli border. On Wednesday, the two neighboring villages and the village of <LOCATION> Soujud </LOCATION> were attacked by Israeli-allied militiamen in a ground assault mounted behind an Israeli army artillery barrage. Israeli news reports today said 40 guerrillas of the pro-Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> were killed and about 30 wounded in those raids. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> said 25 of its fighters were killed, 17 wounded and 20 were missing. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>'s rival, the pro-Syrian Shiite Moslem Amal militia, said three of its guerrillas were killed and 10 wounded. An Israeli army spokesman said five militiamen from the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> were wounded, one of them seriously. Israeli forces reported no casualties. Today's strike was <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 11th air raid on <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> this year. Fifty-two people were killed and 81 wounded in the previous 10 strikes since Jan. 3. Four Israeli helicopter gunships struck at <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> guerrillas on <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>'s outskirts late Wednesday, killing two guerrillas and wounding four. Police said a cluster of cement shacks belonging to <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s mainstream <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> faction took the brunt of the latest raid. Four shacks and three vehicles were destroyed. The target was about 200 yards from <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION>'s `` cubs school'' at the teeming <PERSON> Ein </PERSON> el-Hilweh refugee camp, where dozens of young guerrilla trainees were asleep. The `` school'' was not hit, police said. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said today that the day-long sweep Wednesday was part of an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> policy `` aimed at preventing the establishment and entrenchment of terrorist bases'' used to launch attacks on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lowaizeh </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mleekh </PERSON> and <PERSON> Soujud </PERSON> were described as strongholds of <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>. Israeli radio reports said dozens of guerrillas fled north from the area and that many villagers spent the night in nearby fields. According to the Israeli news reports, Wednesday's sweep involved about 600 <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> fighters using 45 tanks and armored personnel carriers. Israeli troops assisted with heavy artillery fire and rocket attacks from helicopter gunships, the reports said. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION>, Arabic for hope, are locked in a 3-week-old battle for control of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s southern slums, where most of the 18 foreign hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> are believed held. Today, <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> gunners dueled sporadically with mortars, howitzers and tank cannons on the 21st day of fighting for the slums, a 16-square-mile warren of narrow alleyways and cement-block shanties. Police said they had no new casualty report. Their toll for the previous 20 days of fighting stood at 296 killed and 1,000 wounded. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> fighters, who have wrested control of more than 90 percent of the slums from Amal, were bracing for a final assault, police said. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> has massed 7,500 troops, 100 tanks and 400 armored vehicles around the slums for 12 days and has been threatening to occupy the shantytown.

<HEAD>Britain Announces New Measures To Ban Religious Discrimination</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 New laws to combat discrimination of Roman Catholics in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s job market will force companies to report annually on how many Catholics and Protestants they employ. But the measures the government proposed on Wednesday stop short of imposing hiring quotas from among the 40 percent <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> minority. Northern Ireland Secretary <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> said that would be `` inflammatory.'' The laws, expected to be enacted by <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and take effect in mid-1989, mark the toughest attempt to end job discrimination in British-run <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, where Catholic unemployment runs at 2 -LCB- times the Protestant rate. The measures were spurred partly by threats of disinvestment from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, an anti-discrimination tactic the British government calls misguided. Seven American states have endorsed fair employment principles put forward in 1984 by the late Irish statesman <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> MacBride </PERSON> that call for disinvestment measures against companies in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> accused of religious bias. Several more states are expected to follow suit. American investment accounts for nearly 14 percent of the jobs in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. Under the new laws, companies with more than 25 employees _ and later with 10 or more _ will have to submit annual reports on the religious composition of the workforce to a new body, the Fair Employment Commission. Failure to do so will be a criminal offense punishable by a fine of up to $ 3,720. The laws would also ban `` indirect discrimination'' in hiring practices, such as taking recruits from a single school _ Catholics and <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> children are educated separately _ or getting current employees to find new workers. The commission, replacing a watchdog body set up in 1976, will have powers to order companies to recruit from a wider area, such as advertising in Catholic publications. Companies that ignore commission directives could be charged with contempt of court and denied government contracts. <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> is among the most economically depressed regions of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION>. The province's unemployment rate of 17.4 percent is double the national average. The <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the province's main moderate Catholic party, criticized the moves as not being tough enough. <PERSON> Alasdair </PERSON> <PERSON> MacLaughlin </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Confederation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, said the employers' organization was concerned about the way in which targets and timetables are to be used. `` It will be essential that both government and the <ORGANIZATION> Fair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on a continuing basis make it crystal clear that the object of the legislation is not to create or impose quotas,'' he said. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s spokesman on <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON>, said the lack of any targets to judge the success of the proposed legislation was a government `` cop-out.''

<HEAD>Two Student Given Jail Time For Drinking Party At Princeton</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRINCETON, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The jail terms given two <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> students for their role in initiation parties that prompted 46 students to seek medical attention for overdrinking were `` excessive,'' the school's president says. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpler </PERSON>, 20, of <LOCATION> Rehoboth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Del. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Napolitano </PERSON>, 21, of <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, were each sentenced to 30 days in jail and a $ 500 fine Wednesday. Simpler, a junior who is president of the <ORGANIZATION> Charter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, and Ms. <PERSON> Napolitano </PERSON>, a junior who is the university eating club's former social chairman, were convicted May 18 of serving alcoholic beverages to minors in February. Municipal Court Judge <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Annich </PERSON> said Wednesday he did not consider the incident a college prank that got out of hand. `` I'm not aware of a similar event that has produced as many casualties,'' said <PERSON> Annich </PERSON>. `` It is a violation of the law.'' He delayed the start of the sentences so attorneys could appeal. <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> said he was shocked to hear the students will have to serve jail sentences. `` While the incidents in question are certainly serious in nature, the penalty seems to me clearly disproportionate and excessive,'' <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> said. The initiation parties Feb. 6 by the <ORGANIZATION> Charter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> and the Cloister Inn _ two of 13 fraternity-like eating clubs on campus _ resulted in 39 students going to the university's <PERSON> McCosh </PERSON> <PERSON> Infirmary </PERSON> and seven requiring treatment at the Medical Center at <LOCATION> Princeton </LOCATION>. Many of the students were underage. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>'s legal drinking age is 21. Simpler and Ms. <PERSON> Napolitano </PERSON> were convicted after a one-day trial in which witnesses testified that students seeking to join the club were blindfolded and led from room to room as club members poured drinks down their throats. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, 20, the social chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Cloister </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inn </ORGANIZATION>, previously agreed to plead guilty to a disorderly persons offense. Charges against two other Cloister Inn officers were dismissed for lack of evidence. Defense attorney <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Otis </PERSON> called the jail penalty `` totally inappropriate.'' `` We argued that there was selective prosecution and this is selective sentencing _ this is scapegoating,'' <PERSON> Otis </PERSON> said. But prosecutor <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON> said `` if we had information that pointed a finger at other people we would have pursued it.'' The case was one of two major drinking incidents at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> universities. Aggravated hazing charges stemming from the drinking-related death of an 18-year-old fraternity pledge have been filed against 15 <ORGANIZATION> Rutgers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> students, including seven officers of the now-closed <ORGANIZATION> Lambda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alpha </ORGANIZATION> fraternity.

<HEAD>Neighbors Agree To Restore Non-Aggression Pact</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> have revived a non-aggression pact that lapsed three years ago, agreeing not to support guerrilla movements operating in each other's territory The agreement reached Wednesday between ranking diplomats and military officials of the two neighbors was the latest in a series of recent developments signaling an easing of hostilities. The two sides said in a statement that they would reactivate meetings of a joint security commission `` at the earliest possible date.'' The commission was established under the 1984 Nkomati Accord, a non-aggression treaty in which each country pledged to halt support for guerrillas fighting against the other government. Although technically still in effect, the treaty has been ignored since 1985, when <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> found documents indicating <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> was violating the agreement through continued aid to the Mozambican rebels. Since then, the main source of friction between the countries has been <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>'s persistent charge that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has continued covert assistance to the <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> National Resistance rebel movement. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> denies the charge. The war has devastated <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>'s economy and is the main cause of a nationwide famine that has left nearly 6 million of the country's 14.5 million people in need of food aid. Wednesday's statement said: `` The two delegations affirmed the commitments of their respective governments not to support the commission of violence against the peoples of their respective countries.'' No date was announced for the security commission to meet, but both sides have appeared eager in recent weeks to improve relations. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has offered logistical aid to help protect a Mozambican hydroelectric project from rebel saboteurs and the chairman of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s largest conglomerate visited <LOCATION> Maputo </LOCATION> to discuss possible investment. In addition, officials of both countries say a summit meeting may be arranged between their presidents, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Joaquim </PERSON> <PERSON> Chissano </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>'s delegation at Wednesday's talks was headed by the army commander, Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Tobais </PERSON> <PERSON> Dai </PERSON>. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s delegation was led by the director-general of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Niel </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Heerden </PERSON>, and included the <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> chief, Lt.

 An envelope leaking fruit juice was found in a postal box addressed to the ex-husband of <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dann </PERSON>, and authorities were trying to determine if it was part of the woman's shooting and poisoning spree The package addressed to <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Dann </PERSON> was found Wednesday at a suburban post office, police said. It had no return address and was turned over to a laboratory to determine if the juice had been tainted and <PERSON> Dann </PERSON> sent it, said police Sgt. <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalvaitis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dann </PERSON>, 30, fired on students Friday at <ORGANIZATION> Hubbard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Woods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in this affluent <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> suburb, killing an 8-year-old boy and wounding five other children. She then wounded a young man at a home nearby and killed herself. Before her death, <PERSON> Dann </PERSON> mailed or delivered up to 24 packages of snacks or juice _ most tainted with arsenic _ to acquaintances, including several families for whom she had worked as a babysitter, <PERSON> Kalvaitis </PERSON> said.

 A transplant specialist examined <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> two days before the former <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> president entered a hospital complaining of chest pains, a TV station reported. Dr. <PERSON> Livingston </PERSON> <PERSON> Wong </PERSON>, chief of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>'s transplant team, and two unidentified doctors _ a cardiologist and a kidney specialist from the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> _ saw <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> on Sunday at his home here, <ORGANIZATION> KHON </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday The station gave no sources for the report. <PERSON> Wong </PERSON> refused to comment on the report. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Gemmo </PERSON> <PERSON> Trinidad </PERSON> said he knew nothing about the reported visit. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, 70, remained in guarded condition Wednesday night in the intensive care unit at the medical center, <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION> said. Earlier in the day, <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' physician, Dr. <PERSON> Derek </PERSON> <PERSON> Pang </PERSON>, ruled out the possibility of a heart attack, <PERSON> Trindidad </PERSON> said. More tests were ordered for today to determine if a lung ailment caused the chest pains that led <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to enter the hospital Tuesday night, he said. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' staff stationed guards in the intensive care unit and at every entrance to the hospital. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> wife, <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON>, said in a radio interview aired in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> that the former president is suffering because he has not been allowed to return home. <PERSON> Tomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON>, Philippine consul general to <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, dismissed the pains as an attempt on the part of <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to return to his homeland for the funeral of his mother, <PERSON> Josefa </PERSON> <PERSON> Edralin-Marcos </PERSON>, who died May 4 at the age of 95. `` I think these are charades.

<TEXT>
 A federal jury convicted two record company executives and a reputed mob figure of conspiring to extort $ 1.25 million from a record wholesaler. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON>, 60-year-old president of <ORGANIZATION> Roulette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Roulette </ORGANIZATION> comptroller <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>, 60, and reputed Genovese crime family member <PERSON> Dominick </PERSON> <PERSON> Canterino </PERSON>, 57, were convicted Wednesday. Each could receive up to 40 years in prison at sentencing July 8 for conspiracy to commit extortion.

 <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> will withdraw 50,000 troops from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> by the end of the year and will pull out all its forces by 1990, the official <ORGANIZATION> Cambodian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SPK </ORGANIZATION> news agency said today. The Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, reporting from <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>, also reported the pullout announcement. <ORGANIZATION> SPK </ORGANIZATION> quoted a communique from the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> as saying the soldiers would be returning home from June to December. Remaining troops will be placed under the command of the pro-Vietnamese Cambodian government, <ORGANIZATION> SPK </ORGANIZATION> said. A 50,000-troop pullout would be by far the largest of six partial withdrawals <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> claims to have made since 1982. About 20,000 troops returned home in the most recent and largest withdrawal last November. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> says that was the only genuine withdrawal, and it estimates that 120,000-125 ,000 Vietnamese troops remain in the country battling about 50,000 guerrillas <ORGANIZATION> SPK </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, said that over the past nine years, the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> government `` has gradually undertaken the defense work by itself, thus creating the conditions for six annual withdrawals of Vietnamese volunteer troops from <LOCATION> Kampuchea </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> -RRB-.'' `` This time, the command of the Vietnamese volunteer army in <LOCATION> Kampuchea </LOCATION> will also be pulled out from <LOCATION> Kampuchea </LOCATION> and the remaining Vietnamese troops in <LOCATION> Kampuchea </LOCATION> are to be placed under the command of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kampuchea </ORGANIZATION> until their complete withdrawal in 1990.'' The announcement followed word on the Vietnamese pullout by a senior <ORGANIZATION> Vietnamese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official Wednesday to a group of foreign diplomats in <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> diplomat in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> said today. The diplomat, quoting a cable from his country's embassy in <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>, said he had no other details. He gave the information on condition of anonymity. The development came before Sunday's start of the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit, at which President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has said he will ask Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to encourage the Vietnamese to resolve the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> conflict. The Soviet-armed Vietnamese invaded <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in late 1978 and are fighting guerrillas backed militarily or diplomatically by <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, non-communist Southeast Asian countries and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> had warned it will take unspecified action if the guerrillas take advantage of the pullout to try to return to power. The strategy of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, the largest of the guerrilla groups, has been to gain control of villages and wait for the Vietnamese to withdraw in 1990. The Western diplomat said the Vietnamese were moving into the interior of the country, leaving the <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> forces to guard the <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> border area, the traditional area of fighting. Earlier this week, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in response to written questions from reporters from <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> countries that he would raise the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> issue in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Siddhi </PERSON> <PERSON> Savetsila </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> quoted Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> as telling him last week in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> that the Kremlin would talk to the Vietnamese about ending their occupation of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. That could represent a significant change of position _ the Soviets previously stated they have no direct role to play in the conflict and that <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> is a sovereign country whose policies the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> can not influence. In exchange for rights at <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s numerous military bases, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> gives <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> several billion dollars a year in aid.

<TEXT>
 Striking scriptwriters again failed to come to terms with producers on residual payments from reruns but agreed to another bargaining session this weekend in the 12-week-old walkout. Negotiators for the <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> also rejected a proposal by the <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Producers </ORGANIZATION> to extend the proposed contract from three years to four, said <ORGANIZATION> WGA </ORGANIZATION> Executive Director <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Walton </PERSON>. However, Wednesday's five-hour bargaining session, conducted by a federal mediator, ended with agreement to meet again Saturday. The 9,000 TV and film writers went on strike March 7 over creative control and residuals. The walkout cut the TV season short for many shows and is expected to delay the start of the fall season. It has also delayed countless movie projects. The guild also announced it would take a membership vote tonight to approve several independent contracts with TV production companies. As of Wednesday afternoon, <PERSON> Walton </PERSON> said, 39 companies had signed contracts with the union. Among the companies, he said, were those producing `` It's <PERSON> Garry </PERSON> <PERSON> Shandling </PERSON>'s Show,'' `` The Tonight Show,'' starring <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Carson </PERSON>, Alien Productions, which makes `` Alf,'' <ORGANIZATION> Kenny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Productions </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Henson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Associations, which makes the `` Muppets,'' and the production company for `` Days and Nights of <PERSON> Molly </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>.'' `` Late Night With <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON>'' agreed to an as-yet-unsigned contract this week, union President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirgo </PERSON> said. Producers spokesman <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> said the contracts represent less than 10 percent of all film production and less than 15 percent of TV production. `` We'd rather put 4,000 writers back to work than 400,'' he said. During Wednesday's negotiations, producers proposed a formula for one-hour prime-time shows sold into syndication, based on the premise that such shows are selling poorly. `` They rejected the numbers but not the concept,'' <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> said. Under the formula, which the producers have offered twice and the writers have rejected twice, the producers proposed to drop a fixed residual schedule and pay writers based on a show's success in syndication. Producers said writers could earn as much as 150 percent more than under their present pay schedule. The producers alliance said in a statement that the offer would `` meet the fixed residual requirement of the <ORGANIZATION> WGA </ORGANIZATION>, while satisfying AMPTP objectives of having a market price sensitive formula.'' The release did n't detail the offer.

 An Arab assailant sneaked up behind a Jewish seminary student in a perfume market today and stabbed him in the back, police said. The victim was hospitalized and identified as the son of an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> government lawyer who handled land confiscation cases in the occupied territories. But authorities said they believed the attack was random. Police said another Jewish man was stabbed to death later today in the predominantly Jewish neighborhood of <LOCATION> Katamon </LOCATION>, which borders an Arab village. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio quoted police as saying they believed it was a criminal act not motivated by ethnic politics. The neighborhood is a poor area with a high crime rate. The army lifted curfews imposed in parts of the occupied territories after Palestinians defied the restrictions and called a general strike to commemorate slain <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>. Curfews remained in effect in a village and a refugee camp in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, meanwhile, said the 24-week-old <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> uprising has made peace more elusive, but reiterated that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> must vigorously pursue negotiations with its Arab neighbors. Since the Dec. 8 start of the uprising, 195 Palestinians have been killed and hundreds wounded. Two Israelis have died. Witnesses identified the first stabbing victim as <PERSON> Chanoch </PERSON> <PERSON> Albeck </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials said he was the son of <PERSON> Plea </PERSON> <PERSON> Albeck </PERSON>, who has handled land confiscation cases in the occupied territories for the government. <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> police spokesmen said the 16-year-old victim was attacked from behind by a single <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> assailant as he walked through the perfume market, a narrow lane in the Moslem Quarter, apparently on his way to a seminary in the adjacent Jewish Quarter of the city. Several Arabs were immediately detained for questioning and police launched wide searches in the area, said spokesman <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Lapidot </PERSON>. A police source said it appeared unlikely that <PERSON> Albeck </PERSON> was targeted and that investigators believed the attack was random. In a statement, <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Teddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kollek </PERSON> said he was `` shocked and disgusted. The Arab public in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> must understand that such actions in the end will only hurt the Arabs.'' <PERSON> Albeck </PERSON>, who wore a black yarmulka, was rushed by ambulance to nearby <LOCATION> Hadassah </LOCATION> hospital with the knife sticking out of his back after two other seminary students helped him to the Jewish quarter, police and witnesses said. `` He had a knife in the upper part of his back. The entire knife was inside,'' merchant <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Yosipo </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION>. `` He said he was alone when it happened, that he was stabbed and did n't know by whom. There was apparently no scuffle. He was simply stabbed.'' The radio said a witness to the attack, identified as <PERSON> Rami </PERSON> <PERSON> Shebach </PERSON>, said he tried in vain to chase down the Arab assailant. A hospital official, reached by telephone, said the youth was being treated in the intensive care unit and declined to give further details. The last attack on an Israeli in the old city was last October, when a 24-year old man was fatally shot in the head. On Wednesday, a PLO-mandated general strike shut down transportation and commerce in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> and Arab east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. An army curfew confined 200,000 Arabs to their homes in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. The strike was called to mark the end of mourning for <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> military commander, assassinated April 16 at his home outside <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>, whose code name was <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Jihad </PERSON>, spent his boyhood in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Israeli sources said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> security forces were responsible for his death. The Israeli government has not commented on the case. By early today, all curfews were lifted in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, but two remained in effect in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>'s Dheishe refugee camp and the village of <LOCATION> Shuweika </LOCATION>, army officials said. On Wednesday, despite the curfews, scattered anti-Israeli protests occurred, leaving at least six Arabs hurt. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>' remarks were aimed at his political rival, Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, who has said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> should not enter peace talks until calm has returned to the occupied territories. `` I think it's more difficult today,'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, leader of the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> Wednesday night. `` The road to peace is full of obstacles, full of disappointments. But what is the alternative? To let the situation deteriorate?'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, responding to a question, told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> he was concerned about possible human rights violations in the occupied territories, but did not elaborate.

In addition, <PERSON> Figueroa </PERSON> said, the ordinance requires employers to designate smoking and no-smoking areas if workers request them. The ordinance forbids smoking in enclosed public places like taxicabs, public restrooms, polling places and public meeting halls. Bars, hotels and private meeting rooms are exempt. <PERSON> Figueroa </PERSON> said the ordinance carries fines ranging from $ 25 to $ 100, with enforcement details still to be worked out.

<TEXT>
 The offspring of the Baby Boomers are continuing their sharp increase of recent years, the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> reported today. The number of Americans aged 5 and under totaled 18.3 million as of 1987, up from 18.2 million in 1986 and just over 18 million the year before that. Still, the total is well short of the 20.5 million preschoolers recorded in 1961, near the end of the post World War II Baby Boom. Population experts stress that the current surge in tots does not constitute another boom, but rather is an `` echo'' of that earlier one, since the great mass of people born in the two decades following that war are now producing their own families. This increase has been underway for several years, with the number of Americans under age 5 up by 1.9 million from 1980 to 1987. Meanwhile, the number aged 5 to 17 has declined in this decade, slipping from 47.4 million in 1980 to 45.3 million in the 1987 estimates. In the same period, those aged 18 to 24 declined from 30.0 million to 27.1 million, while all other age groups increased. Other findings of the study included: _ <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> both registered population losses for the first time in this decade, as the continuing slowdown in the energy industry affected growth rates in several states Declines continued in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>. _ Population loss also affected agricultural states, with declines reported for <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>

Five leopards owned by <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> escaped from their cages Wednesday at the singer's home on 200 acres near <LOCATION> Ashland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, said police Lt. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmore </PERSON>. An orange spotted leopard attacked 2-year-old <PERSON> Nikka </PERSON> <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> in the family's yard, where the child was playing, police said. <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>'s only child died later Wednesday at <ORGANIZATION> Vanderbilt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> from blood loss and massive injuries to her head and neck, said hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>. The 7-year-old leopard, <PERSON> Tabus </PERSON>, was captured soon after the attack, along with four others. More than 40 police officers and wildlife officials using a helicopter searched for five hours before finding the fifth leopard, a 40-pound cub. <PERSON> Tabu </PERSON> was tranquilized but died while being taken to a wildlife facility, police said. Police Chief <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> said he did not know how the animals got out of the cages. Savage was in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, when the attack occurred, police said. All five animals had been declawed, said Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, a veterinarian who had treated the animals. In 1986, <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> successfully lobbied against a bill in the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> to restrict ownership of exotic animals. `` If an animal is kept in a very rural situation and he has enough room and there are no other people around, what harm can it do?'' <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> said in November. Savage, whose act features wild make-up and fireworks, has traveled across the country performing with pythons and leopards in his show. He was treated at a <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> hospital in 1984 after a boa constrictor choked him during an act, in which he wrapped snakes around his neck.

 The major television networks have moved to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for a superpower summit that may end up producing more pomp than news. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> arrived early Thursday in <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> for a four-day stopover en route to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. He arrives in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Sunday for his fourth summit with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> had hoped to use the summit to sign a treaty reducing their arsenals of strategic nuclear weapons, but negotiations over the pact have stalled over the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Initiative </ORGANIZATION> _ Star Wars _ and verification issues. `` It's clear both sides are prepared to accentuate the positive, orchestrate the ceremonial side of the summit,'' said <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> anchor <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rather </PERSON>. `` I think there'll be a lot of smiles, a lot of toasts and a lot of talk about promise in the future and great beginnings. `` But one of the jobs of a reporter is to separate bullshine from brass tacks. Unless something changes, it's going to be more of the former and less of the latter. `` But the ceremonial stuff, it'll be terrific,'' he said. `` The Russians are pretty good at great ceremony.'' This will be the first visit by the 77-year-old <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to the country he once called an evil empire, and it's the first visit of an American president to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in 14 years. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> started its pre-summit coverage Wednesday night with Rather anchoring the `` CBS Evening News'' from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Syrian Official: Agreement Reached To End South Beirut Fighting</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Israel-Lebanon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Syrian official said <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and a pro-Iranian militia reached an agreement to stop fighting today in the southern suburbs of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. But gunners from the pro-Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, and the Syrian-aided <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> continued fighting sporadically with mortars, howitzers and tank cannons on the 21st day of struggle for the slums, where 18 foreign hostages are believed held. Another report, in the leftist <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> daily As-Safir, said a solution to the conflict `` has been delayed because secret negotiations on the fate of the American hostages in particular have not reached a definite result.'' Nine of the foreign hostages are Americans. The Syrian official, speaking on condition of anonymity in <LOCATION> Damuscus </LOCATION>, said, `` Ending the fighting will create new hope for the hostages, and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> will spare no effort to secure their release, regardless of their nationality.'' The official did not give details of the agreement but said it had been agreed to by all parties, including <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION>, after a meeting between President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> leaders late Wednesday. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> is a group of Moslem Shiite fundamentalists in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> believed to be an umbrella for smaller organizations holding the foreign hostages. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> has been threatening to intervene to stop the fighting. It has about 7,500 troops, 100 tanks and 400 armored units ringing the 16-square-mile warren of narrow alleyways and cement shanties, where nearly 300 persons have been killed in the fighting. Syrian officials also have been negotiating with <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> and Iranian officials, including two deputy foreign ministers, to work out a plan for Syrian troop deployment to bring security to the southern suburbs. Syrian sources have said that they were willing to use force if necessary but it was only a last option. Threats to kill hostages if the <ORGANIZATION> Syrians </ORGANIZATION> used force have been reported. The Syrians have said any action against the hostages would be considered an act against <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>. The battle between Amal and <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> over control of the southern suburbs has created tension between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, which is <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s only major Arab ally in its 7 -LCB- - year-old war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> Israeli planes today attacked <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> positions in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> today. It followed ground attacks by Israeli-allied militiamen on two villages Wednesday. The As-Safir report, which could not be verified, quoted unidentified diplomatic sources as saying `` serious negotiations'' are being held between <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and some `` Iranian-allied groups'' on the nine American hostages. The short report did not disclose further details. The hostage held longest is American <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. He was abducted March 16, 1985.

 A man accused of tricking 50 women into giving him their underwear has been fined $ 500 and ordered to undergo psychiatric treatment. `` I was n't like this before,'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>, 38, told Circuit Judge <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> McDade </PERSON> at sentencing Tuesday. <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON> had pleaded guilty to two counts of misdemeanor theft.

<TEXT>
 Leading Soviet officials today called for burying the `` corpse of the Cold War'' and lauded President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for his pledge to come to next week's summit in search of peace. They said the meetings could produce important advances in negotiations toward a treaty to cut <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet long-range nuclear arsenals by 50 percent. One official asserted U.S.-Soviet relations had warmed because <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had adopted the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION>'s way of thinking on disarmament and international relations. Some of the nation's top advisers on foreign policy met with reporters to discuss the summit and its significance for relations between the superpowers. They generally forecast improving relations. The state-run press also said superpower ties were improving. The labor newspaper Trud pressed for a successful summit and said that the vast majority of Americans want a better relationship with Soviets. The newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> declared that the two nations have entered a `` political thaw.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was to arrive Sunday for five days of meetings with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, the fourth summit between the two leaders in less than three years. `` Previously, our goals were more limited,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> affairs expert <PERSON> Georgy </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Arbatov </PERSON>, observing that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in the past focused on easing tensions built up since World War II. `` Now, we have the possibility to move toward demilitarization of Soviet-American relations,'' said <PERSON> Arbatov </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> USA-Canada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. He compared the Cold War to a dying patient kept alive by artificial means. The task at hand for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is to bury `` this corpse of the Cold War, which with the help of artificial means _ political adrenalin and the political machinery of an artificial heart _ has been maintained in a semi-living state.'' Asked about <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s comment Wednesday that he viewed his journey to the Soviet capital as a mission of peace, <PERSON> Arbatov </PERSON> smiled and replied: `` I think there is something symbolic in this, that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is now coming with an olive branch to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>.'' He said he was happy to concede that his view of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had changed from that of a cold warrior to a statesman with whom the Kremlin can work. But <PERSON> Arbatov </PERSON> said the president himself brought about the improvement by coming around to the Soviets' way of thinking on disarmament and international relations. Marshal <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Akhromeyev </PERSON>, military chief of staff and first deputy defense minister, restated Kremlin positions that there is no Soviet superiority in conventional weapons in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> or excessive military spending. But asked for details, <PERSON> Akhromeyev </PERSON> made the rare acknowledgement that the reported defense budget does not reflect spending on research, development and production of weapons. <PERSON> Akhromeyev </PERSON> declined to say how much of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s gross national product is invested in defense, saying he was privy only to the budget approved by the Supreme Soviet, the nominal parliament, which amounts to about 5 percent of government spending. Western estimates have put Soviet defense spending as high as 19 percent of the gross national product, which represents the total value of all goods and services producted. <PERSON> Arbatov </PERSON> dismissed foreign assessments as `` speculation,'' but conceded that Soviet military spending is proportionately higher than in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> because the Soviet gross national product is lower while the demands of security are equal. Poking fun at the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arbatov </PERSON> said the Soviet military `` can not do as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> does and sell toilet seats for $ 700 or a hammer for $ 150.'' He was apparently referring to reports of excessive costs charged the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government under some private contracts with the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrovsky </PERSON> told reporters that the Soviets view the upcoming summit as an important step in continuing improvement of relations rather than as a farewell to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, whose term ends in January.

<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A policeman called to an office building where a lawyer had disappeared found blood splattered on the floor and walls and scuff marks outside the woman's office but concluded she had probably cut her finger. The woman was later found bound and gagged at the home of a building security guard and had been raped during her 13-hour ordeal, police said. Police Chief <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Bouza </PERSON> said the policeman, a 15-year veteran, wo n't be disciplined for his handling of the Sunday night kidnapping. `` There was no dereliction of duty, absence from post or failure to respond,'' <PERSON> Bouza </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` I do n't discipline people who are trying to do their jobs and make a mistake in good faith.'' He also dismissed the suggestion that prompter police action could have prevented the rape or at least shortened the victim's ordeal `` We could not have prevented the rape, of that I'm sure,'' he said. `` By the time the police were able to do anything the rape had occurred. She had been missing for hours -LRB- by the time police were called -RRB-.'' The abduction took place about 9 p.m. Sunday in a downtown building where the woman had returned to her office to catch up on some work, police said. Her husband reported her missing after he went to pick her up at 11 p.m. Among the clues brought to officers' attention were blood on the floor and walls outside her office, scuff marks, and the observation of the victim's husband that she had apparently stopped writing in mid-sentence. The officer, the senior patrolman at the scene, indicated in his report that the woman had probably cut her finger in the office. The officer notified a homicide detective working the after-midnight shift, but neither he nor the detective investigated further, police said. The incident was treated as a missing person case, meaning that it would not be assigned to a detective until the start of the next business day, police said. Two homicide detectives sent to the scene Monday morning quickly concluded there was evidence of a crime. In the meantime, employees of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> had tracked down the guard and staked out his house, where he had allegedly taken the woman after putting her in the trunk of his car. Company investigators had been alerted when the guard, who worked Sunday night, returned to the building about 3 a.m., ostensibly to use a cash machine, and was seen by another guard with blood on his shirt, authorities said. <PERSON> Dwayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> West </PERSON>, 24, was arrested Monday and charged with two counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct.

 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today called for creation of an international drug strike force that would destroy drug crops wherever they are grown. `` Our military forces have already made a substantial contribution to our interdiction effort and today they're being called upon to do more. Their primary target should be the production of drugs abroad,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in a campaign speech to a <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> audience, also said he opposes any effort to weaken the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s `` zero tolerance'' policy for seizing vehicles on which drugs are found `` Some call this policy controversial, especially among those big yacht owners out there,'' the vice president said. `` I think it makes great sense. If people can lose their cars for parking violations, surely they should lose them for carrying drugs. Zero tolerance should be the policy of every state in the union.'' The Republican presidential nominee-to-be planned to stress drug themes all day in campaign appearances, including a visit in <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> to a drug rehabilitation center. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that, if elected, he would urge other nations to join in establishing `` an international strike force to hit back, quick and hard and often, at foreign drug operations.'' He said it would be far simpler and less expensive to eradicate drugs at their source than to try to find and get rid of them later. `` We need to wipe out crops wherever they are grown and take out labs wherever they exist,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. The vice president also said he would make adoption of drug-free programs a condition for companies to receive federal contracts `` and I will ask the states to do the same.'' In <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> on Wednesday night, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that even though he and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> may have some differences on dealing with Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, both want the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> leader out of power. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that he is n't discouraged that the administration's efforts to negotiate an agreement with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> collapsed on Wednesday The vice president, who aides have described as opposed to the talks, said `` public opinion may be more on the side of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>'' as a result of the impasse. Although <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that he and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` have had some differences'' on the subject, the vice president said they share a common goal. `` We have a policy objective of still getting <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> out of power,'' he told reporters on Wednesday. `` The fact that we have n't solved the problem at this instance does n't depress me, because I do n't want a bad deal, I want a good deal,'' he said. Addressing a Republican rally in <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> on Wednesday night, the presumed <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential candidate said that, if elected, he would put his vice president in charge of anti-drug programs `` in a drug czar-like posture.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has called for the death penalty for `` drug kingpins,'' but has dodged questions on whether this should also apply to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who is under indictment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on drug-trafficking charges. Earlier in the day, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> Lakehurst </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, that he was spending two days campaigning in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, even though he has the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination clinched, because he was concerned about polls showing him trailing the front-runner in the Democratic presidential race, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` We're behind. I'm the underdog. You've seen that in the polls,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. However, he later voiced confidence that he would close the gap, asking: `` Why should I worry about polls in May when the election is held in November?'' He suggested that the race on the Democratic side between <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was giving <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> a false image as a conservative because he comes across as less liberal than <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` It's a blur out there,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign officials said that <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Teeley </PERSON>, a longtime <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> adviser, was stepping down from his job as campaign communications director. Campaign Manager <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Teeley </PERSON> would remain with the campaign but be `` a more creative type guy and work specifically on the surrogate teams.'' No further reason was given for the switch, but <PERSON> Teeley </PERSON> was known to have been at odds recently with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> chief of staff <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>. <PERSON> Teeley </PERSON> will `` continue on as a senior political adviser,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>. `` As we head into the fall campaign, roles and responsibilities are going to shift and change. It's the right time for such shifts to occur,'' <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said. `` I would n't characterize it as a shakeup,'' <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said. After a full day of campaigning in the <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> area today, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> planned to fly to his vacation retreat in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, where he will spend a week in strategy sessions and in meetings on issues with <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> governors and other <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> leaders. In other developments on Wednesday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: _ Called for naming of an independent counsel to study recent allegations of financial irregularities surrounding <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION> `` We're going to go after <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> hard and talk about ethics. If they want to talk about -LRB- Attorney General -RRB- <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, how about talking about the speaker?'' The allegations concern royalties on a <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> book and his intervention with federal regulators on behalf of troubled <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> savings and loan associations. _ Told a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> commencement ceremony that a `` liberal elite'' was jeopardizing the nation's security by failing to support weapons programs he said were needed Although he did n't mention them by name, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s comments were apparently aimed at both <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>

 Republican presidential nominee-to-be <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called today for an international strike force to hit `` quick and hard and often'' at foreign drug operations. Democrats <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> criticized the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration for its dealings with <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sought to recoup from the breakdown of talks aimed at dislodging <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who faces drug trafficking charges in this country, with tough talk on drugs during campaign stops in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. `` Our military forces have already made a substantial contribution to our interdiction effort and today they're being called upon to do more. Their primary target should be the production of drugs abroad,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. He called for `` an international strike force to hit back, quick and hard and often, at foreign drug operations'' to stop narcotics production at the source. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s comments came during campaign appearances in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, one of four states with primaries on June 7. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> concentrated on <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, the big prize on that final primary day. As the two Democrats debated in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> Wednesday night, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who released a five-year budget blueprint this week, urged <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to spell out his spending plans. `` The governor is laying out a budget of promises but not a budget of numbers,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> replied that his experience as governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> has taught him that it was a `` serious mistake'' to lay out a detailed budget plan so far in advance, because the revenue picture can change drastically. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also pressed his rival on policy toward <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> advocates putting pressure on the apartheid regime through economic sanctions; <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> wants <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> declared a terrorist state. But the two found little to differ about when it came to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, and they made certain to bring <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> into it. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> attacked <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s call for the death penalty for drug kingpins. In light of the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> affair, he said, `` I do n't know of anything phonier than that kind of policy. `` It's the height of hypocrisy for people in the administration to be advocating the death penalty for drug pushers while they are doing business with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and funneling aid to the Contras through convicted drug dealers,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who opposes the death penalty. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> must answer, how much did he know about <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and drugs, and when?'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. As for drug traffickers, he said: `` Do not deal with them and give them sanctuary and put them on the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> payroll.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been treading a fine line on the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> affair. He has acknowledged that the controversy was probably partly to blame for his slide in the polls against <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, his likely November opponent. `` We're behind. I'm the underdog. You've seen that in the polls,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said at a campaign stop in <LOCATION> Lakehurst </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, on Wednesday. The vice president signalled last week that he disagreed with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s handling of the matter. But he did it discreetly, refusing to even mention <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s name. When Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> announced Wednesday that talks aimed at getting <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> out had collapsed and no new ones were planned, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> responded: `` The fact that we have n't solved this does n't depress me `` I do n't want a bad deal,'' he said, coming as close as he has yet to publicly criticizing the administration's apparent readiness to drop drug charges as part of a deal to get <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> out. `` I want a good deal. ... We'll have to go back and figure it out,'' he said, expressing optimism that the military leader would eventually go. Aides said last week that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had urged that the negotiations with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> be suspended. But on Wednesday, he stressed his unity with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> rather than his differences, saying he and the president share the `` policy objective of getting <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> out of power.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was taking the offensive on another controversy, calling for an independent counsel to investigate possible ethics breaches by <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. The Democrats have made Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and his legal woes a campaign issue. `` If they're going to talk about <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, how about talking about ... the speaker?'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> has denied he violated ethics rules. In another development, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign communications director, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Teeley </PERSON>, announced he was quitting his post but would stay on with the campaign in some capacity. <PERSON> Teeley </PERSON> said he had not been given sufficient access to be an effective spokesman for the campaign. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and his aides have been sounding more and more confident that the June 7 contests will give the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor the number of delegates needed to nominate. `` I think we've got a very good chance of wrapping up this nomination the first week or two of June,'' he said at a refueling stop in <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, as he flew to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> on Wednesday. `` We want to wrap up this nomination, if I can, as soon as possible.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is far ahead of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in the delegate race. According to the latest <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> count, he has 1,687 to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s 983, of the 2,081 needed to nominate. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> met privately after their debate, and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said the two were `` keenly aware of our joint responsibility to our party.'' But he also joked that the two talked about `` trying to balance my ticket with a conservative.''

 A group of white South Africans met today with four members of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to seek common ground in the struggle against apartheid. In <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, meanwhile, South African church leaders demanded in talks with Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> that the Common Market adopt tough measures to pressure the <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> government to dismantle its race laws. Delegation leader <PERSON> Wynand </PERSON> <PERSON> Malan </PERSON> said the eight white delegates were meeting confidentially with the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla movement to seek `` common ground and strategies.'' <PERSON> Malan </PERSON> is a member of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and head of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> is waging a bombing and sabotage campaign against the white minority government of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. It is based in <LOCATION> Lusaka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> members at the <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> meeting were <PERSON> Thabo </PERSON> <PERSON> Mbeki </PERSON>, head of information and publicity; <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Seedat </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>'s chief representative in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> <PERSON> Pahad </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> <PERSON> Zuma </PERSON>. All four belong to the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>'s national executive committee. <PERSON> Malan </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in an interview at a <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> hotel that the two groups would meet throughout the day. `` This is a normal further discussion with the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>, seeking a common ground and strategies out of the impasse,'' in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Malan </PERSON> said. `` It's the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>'s policy to meet with all political groupings.'' <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> was chosen as a meeting site, <PERSON> Malan </PERSON> said, because it was easy for both sides to get to quickly. <PERSON> Malan </PERSON> said he would return to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> this evening. `` The <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> belongs to the essential political forces in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and is therefore an important dialogue partner,'' <PERSON> Malan </PERSON> told reporters. Among those meeting with <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> were the Rev. <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesak </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reformed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION>; Dr. <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Beyers-Naude </PERSON>, former head of the South African Council of Churches; and <PERSON> Denis </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurley </PERSON>, the Roman Catholic archbishop of <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION>. The church leaders complained of `` a lack of engagement in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'' toward real attempts to pressure the <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> government for change, according to a statement issued by the group. They demanded that <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> nations reduce the number of their diplomatic personnel in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, place increased economic pressure on <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>, institute stricter visa requirements for South Africans wishing to visit <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, and take other measures. The group made its demands in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> because <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> holds the rotating Common Market presidency. The church group was visiting <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> separately from the apartheid opponents. Tha talks with the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> were expected to focus on a political program for anti-apartheid groups that do not participate in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s tri-cameral <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. It has separate chambers for whites, Asians and people of mixed race, but there is no representation for the nation's 26 million black majority. By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which the blacks have no vote in South African national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s chief military adviser said today the U.S.-Soviet treaty to remove ground-launched, intermediate-range nuclear missiles means <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s conventional forces must be improved. West German Gen. <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Altenburg </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s panel of chiefs of staff, said he has found no evidence the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will cut back its military. `` They -LRB- the Soviets -RRB- are not able to define in which way their strategy has changed from an admittedly offensive to a presently defensive strategy,'' he said. <PERSON> Altenburg </PERSON> spoke after giving <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> defense ministers, at their regular spring conference, a routine briefing on Soviet military capabilities. He also predicted the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies will formally ask <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> to accept the transfer of 72 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> F-16 jetfighters that are to be removed from <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> within three years. Sources said the ministers discussed how the transfer, estimated to cost $ 500 million, should be funded. <PERSON> Altenburg </PERSON> said this would likely be done through <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s joint infrastructure program. `` I am quite sure that all members of the alliance agree that we do this economically.'' The 72 jetfighters, comprising the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s 401st Tactical Fighter Wing, are to be removed from the <LOCATION> Torrejon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> under a January agreement between <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Altenburg </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> still views <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> as an offensive alliance and that it shows no signs of reducing its military outlays. `` There is no evidence whatsoever in that respect that things have really changed.'' He added that unabated growth in Soviet military outlays were linked to the treaty under which hundreds of intermediate-range nuclear missiles will be removed from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> signed the treaty Dec. 8 in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` We think that after the INF treaty, the need to maintain our conventional posture ... is more important than ever,'' he said. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> and his <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> colleagues were meeting to review how the allies must share their common defense costs and ways they can make better use of available funds. On Wednesday, the alliance's European defense chiefs complained that some of the recent <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> criticism about their contributions to the alliance was unjustified. In a report, the ministers detailed their contributions to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>, countering <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> congressional criticism that <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> fails to pull its weight in the alliance. `` <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> is taking a fair share of the burdens in the alliance,'' Dutch Defense Minister <PERSON> Wim </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Eekelen </PERSON>, chairman of the meeting of the European ministers, said later. The debate over who pays what in <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> stems from congressional efforts to curb <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> defense spending. The Europeans' report said that of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s standing forces, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> provides 90 percent of the troops and artillery, 80 percent of the tanks and combat planes and 65 percent of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> warships. It said 3.5 million European men and women are on active duty and 3.5 million are in reserve. By comparison, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has 2.3 million active duty troops and 1.5 million reservists, the report said. In their report, <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s European members agreed all allies must do more for <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>, in part by better managing their budgets. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> spent 6.7 percent of its gross national product on defense in 1987 against an average of 3.3 percent for the <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> allies. The Europeans argue the spending comparisons ignore unquantifiable burdens for them, such as environmental damage from allied maneuvers and loss of income from real estate dedicated to military bases and other defense facilities.

<HEAD>Prosecutors Investigating Medical Examiner's Office Over Sale of
Bones</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The county's chief medical examiner is the target of an investigation into allegations he improperly earned more than $ 100,000 selling bones from the dead, the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Antonio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Light </ORGANIZATION> reported today. The Light said an unidentified source provided documents detailing the sale of hundreds of bones since 1983 by <ORGANIZATION> Bexar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chief </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Examiner </ORGANIZATION> Dr. <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> DiMaio </PERSON>'s. The bones, obtained from bodies taken to the county morgue, went to the non-profit <ORGANIZATION> Bone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, where they were cleaned, chopped into pieces and freeze-dried for transplantation, mostly for back, dental or reconstructive surgery, the newspaper reported. Survivors of the dead gave their consent, thinking the bones were `` gifts of life'' to the foundation, but <PERSON> DiMaio </PERSON> charged up to $ 200 for each bone removed, the Light reported. A secretary in <PERSON> DiMaio </PERSON>'s office today said he would be out of the office until next week. The alleged sideline business is under investigation by the district attorney's office, the newspaper said. The investigation focuses on whether <PERSON> DiMaio </PERSON> legally could charge the fees if he was extracting the bones on county time and using county facilities and employees, a source outside the district attorney's office told the Light. The newspaper said invoices it obtained indicate the foundation paid <PERSON> DiMaio </PERSON> up to $ 10,000 per month for bones, but none of those payments went to the county. The county has a formal agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> Bone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> to be paid $ 25 for every donor to cover basic organ-harvesting costs.

<HEAD>Dime-Size Flaw Blamed In Fuel Tank Collapse</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CATHERINE DRESSLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> today said the Jan. 2 fuel tank collapse that fouled two major rivers and contaminated drinking water in three states resulted from a dime-size flaw in the tank's nearly 50-year-old steel. A crack emanated from the flaw as workers were filling the 4-million-gallon tank at <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION>'s Floreffe Terminal south of here in freezing temperatures, <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> said, citing a report it commissioned from the <ORGANIZATION> Battelle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbus </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. Steel plate of that era lacked the toughness of modern steel and was made more brittle by the cold weather, <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> said at a news conference. The wall gave way under the pressure of 3.8 million gallons of diesel fuel, and an estimated 713,000 gallons entered the <LOCATION> Monongahela </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. The spill forced communities downstream along the <LOCATION> Monongahela </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> rivers in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> to close their drinking water intakes. About 23,000 suburban <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> residents were without tap water for most of the week because their water system lacked adequate reserves. The steel was flawed before the plates were welded to make a tank at an Ashland terminal near <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> around 1940, <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Mesloh </PERSON>, head of the <LOCATION> Battelle </LOCATION> investigators, said in a report. The original welding and welds made when the tank was cut apart and reassembled near <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> in 1986 made the steel more brittle around the flaw in the bottom row of plates in the tank's circular wall, he said. `` These factors, combined with cold temperatures and the stress placed on the tank as it was being filled near capacity created the conditions required for brittle fracture,'' <PERSON> Mesloh </PERSON> said in the report. X-rays of the welds made during the reconstruction showed some of the joints did not meet construction standards, but tests performed by <PERSON> Battelle </PERSON> indicated the welds were nonetheless stronger than the steel plate, <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Battelle </PERSON> also found that the steel had not deteriorated over time.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> filed a formal complaint with the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee today asking for an investigation to determine if House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> violated <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics rules. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>'s complaint, which was accompanied by a supporting letter signed by 71 <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Republicans, asked for an investigation in four areas, including published reports that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> received unusually high royalities of 55 percent from his book, `` Reflections of a Public Man.'' Common Cause, which calls itself a citizens lobby, urged the ethics committee last week to launch an investigation of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. While the panel was not required legally to respond to that request, <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>'s complaint will require a formal vote on whether to launch an investigation. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s book was published by a printing company that received nearly $ 300,000 in business from his campaign committee in 1985-86, the complaint said in asking for an investigation into whether <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> converted campaign funds from the sale of his book to his personal gain. The complaint also cited reports of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s 1979 intervention with Egyptian President <PERSON> Anwar </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON> in behalf of a businessman who earlier had allowed <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> to invest in a proven oil well, and 1980 reports that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> intervened with the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> to influence a gas lease decision involving a company in which <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> owned $ 15,000 worth of stock. `` The volume of published evidence clearly calls for investigation,'' said <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, a leader of <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> conservatives in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> who before today had waged a solitary year-long ethics campaign against <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> was asked what he thought of <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> and said his views of the conservative <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> congressman `` are similar to those of a fire hydrant toward dogs.'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> sent a letter to Rep. <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Calif., chairman of the ethics committee, on Wednesday promising his full cooperation if the panel, made up of six Democrats and six Republicans, decided to investigate him `` I feel certain I have not violated any House rules,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said today. `` I most certainly have never intended to do so.'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said he hopes the ethics panel will resolve the matter promptly and `` if they find that I have violated some rule, just say so ... and have it done so it does n't become an encumbrance ... an embarassment'' to the Democrats. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> of timing his complaint so that the ethics investigation would coincide with the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION>, which <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> is scheduled to chair. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, who has been calling for an investigation of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> since last December, denied that the complaint was timed to detract attention from Democratic efforts to use the ethics issue against Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the presidential campaign. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> said, however, that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aides have been meeting with his staff over the past seven to eight weeks to discuss <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>'s ethics campaign against <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> He also said he has been getting `` supportive comments'' privately from the White House for the past three months. On Wednesday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called for the naming of an independent counsel to study allegations of financial irregularities surrounding <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>.

 Certain `` Circus America'' playpens, sold nationwide, pose the danger of crushing children's fingers and may present a smothering hazard if not used correctly, the <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Product </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said today. The soft, mesh-sided playpens sold for about $ 90. They can be identified by a self-adhesive label on the floorboard, stating `` Art. 585, Circus America Ex.'' About 2,500 of the playpens have been sold since 1984. They were imported from <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> by <ORGANIZATION> C </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> Moonachie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J </LOCATION>. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, the design of these playpens presents the possibility of a child's fingers being crushed in the drop sides. Also, if the sides are left folded down, an infant could fall into the loose mesh and suffocate, the agency said. No deaths or injuries have been reported involving <ORGANIZATION> Circus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> playpens, but some have occurred involving other playpens of similar design, the commission said. C & amp; T is offering a free modification kit including a warning label explaining how to avoid the suffocation danger and plastic inserts to prevent the possibility of finger crushing. The kit also includes replacement plastic for the playpen, since the <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> is concerned that the removable feet provided originally could pose a choking hazard for children. Consumers can obtain the modification kits by calling C & amp; T at 1-800-537-1922. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> residents should call 1-201-896-2555. People needing more information or seeking to report a product hazard can contact the safety commission at 1-800-638-2772.

 The judge in the Iran-Contra case said today that the congressional immunity granted <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> and two co-defendands could make trying the three on conspiracy charges a `` practical impossibility.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> raised the problem at a hearing on the difficulty resulting from immunized testimony given to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> by <PERSON> North </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> staff member; former presidential <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> Adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, and businessman <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> made no ruling on the question of proceeding with trial and is not expected to for some time. But the judge told attorneys in the case that under normal trial procedures, a defendant could take the stand and be questioned by a co-defendant about testimony given earlier to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Inthis case, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said, none of the statements given <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> under a grant of limited immunity from prosecution can be used at trial. `` As I see it, it is a practical impossibility to try the conspiracy counts ...'' <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said. `` If you try them -LRB- the defendants -RRB- together, you violate the immunities.'' <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said separate trials also would raise a problem because the defendants might not be able to call each other as witnesses to defend their own positions. For instance, <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> could refuse to testify that he authorized <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s activities in the Iran-Contra affair if subpoenaed by <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyers. North, <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> and businessman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> are charged with conspiring to turn a lawful presidential directive to sell arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> into an illegal enterprise, which included profiting from the weapons sales and assistance to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels during a ban on such aid. <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> did not testify under an immunity grant. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, attorney for <PERSON> North </PERSON>, argued at the hearing that the case should not go forward because the prosecution staff of Independent Counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> and grand jury witnesses were exposed to the immunized testimony. `` Their testimony is being used against them,'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said. `` There's no way of unscrambling that problem. It is a problem that absolutely prevades the case. `` You ca n't unscramble what witnesses now know after what they had seen and heard from immunized testimony, and what they -LRB- knew -RRB- before.'' While the conspiracy counts are the main charges, other charges against the three include theft of government property, acceptance of an illegal gratuity, obstruction of a congressional investigation, false statements to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and obstruction of a presidential inquiry. At an earlier hearing, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said it also could be difficult to proceed to trial unless the government made available to the defense thousands of classified documents in the case. Federal officials have been sending those documents on a regular basis to a secure facility rented by the federal government for the use of the defendants. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> did not say at today's hearing whether he remains as concerned about the classified document problem as he had been.

 A bomb exploded today outside the home of a woman organizing a controversial conference on the future of U.S.-Cuba relations. No one was hurt. The hotel hosting the forum immediately canceled it. No one claimed responsibility for the blast at the home of <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Christina </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON>, who has favored dialogue with the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> government, said it appeared to be the work of anti-Castro militants.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> educators, still facing a retreat in parochial school enrollment, are looking toward a future in which religious education programs outside school loom even larger. Indeed, at a week-long symposium on the future of <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> education that ends today, most of the discussion centered on programs that reach out to children and adults outside the traditional school structure. There was virtually no debate at the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Project </ORGANIZATION> sessions about how to stem the erosion of parochial schools, which lost 110 more schools and 103,000 students last year alone. There are now 2.6 million students in 8,992 Catholic schools, down from a peak of 5.6 million in more than 13,000 schools in 1964. Even before adjourning, the nearly 300 educators at the conference had decided against trying to finish writing a `` vision statement'' on their church's educational mission for the next century. But asked to identify the most important elements of <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> education, they gave strongest support to the declaration, `` Catholic education exists to proclaim the gospel, to promote lifelong personal growth and faith formation of all peoples, and to support the mission of the church.'' Other priority items included promoting `` respect for all cultures which make up our pluralistic society,'' eliminating sexism and racism, paying particular concern to education of the poor, and making better use of `` our changing resources.'' The actual writing of the final document was to done later by representatives of the 22 church groups at the meeting held at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dayton </ORGANIZATION>. Only a quarter of the educators at the symposium are involved in parochial schools. Others work with young adults, converts, college students and <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> children from public school. Historically, the public school child who attended weekly religion classes `` was considered a second class citizen,'' said <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Malone </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Youngstown </LOCATION>. But now, archdioceses around the country are installing paid, full-time directors of religious education, like <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Kayser </PERSON>, a laywoman who runs the programs for <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Thomas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Parish </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Crystal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION> `` When the topic of <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> education comes up, there's too much emphasis in thinking it means only schools,'' said <PERSON> Kayser </PERSON>, who has 650 students in her programs. In some places, she said, `` there has been a real injustice in balancing'' between the needs of the school and the religious education program. The Rev. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON>, pastor of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> James </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bridgeport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, said only 280 of the 2,900 families in his parish send children to the parochial school, but the school, with a $ 530,000 budget, consumes half the parish revenues. <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> is trying to rename the school the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> James </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Religious </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Formation </ORGANIZATION> to stress some of his parish's prayer classes, scripture study and other educational activities, but he admits his parishioners `` get nervous'' about such a change. <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> said Catholic schools must emphasize the teaching of faith `` just as much as geography, math or anything else.'' There is no reason to operate a parochial school that `` smells like and looks like the public school except for maybe a course in religion and an amorphous Catholic environment,'' he said. Bishop <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Schulte </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, who heads the bishops' committee on education, said in an interview, `` I believe there's no adequate substitute for the full curriculum Catholic school But he acknowledged that there are `` very substantial areas'' where Catholic parents simply do n't have a parochial school available. To those who would like to see the church shift more resources into other religion education efforts, <PERSON> Schulte </PERSON> said, `` There's a fallacy ... that if the Catholic school was not present in a parish, then all or most of that money would then go into other educational programs.'' Most of the money is in the form of tuition that would disappear with the school, he said. Parochial schools flourished in big cities with immigrants from <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> lands like <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. When <PERSON> Catholics </PERSON> became more affluent and moved to the suburbs, churches followed, but schools did not. `` We have buildings in places where we do n't have <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> children, and we have <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> children in places where we do n't have schools,'' said Sister <PERSON> Lourdes </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a sponsor of the symposium <PERSON> Malone </PERSON> said, `` The genius of the meeting has to be to affirm the continued importance and place of the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> school ... but then acknowledge generously and fully that these other activities and ministries are a part of <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> education.'' `` Ideally, the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> school is the best vehicle we've had for helping parents teach values in the Catholic tradition,'' said <PERSON> Malone </PERSON>. But `` we've never had more than 50 percent of our kids in Catholic schools,'' he added. `` What happens if you ca n't have a Cadillac, you certainly find out you can fix up the <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION> pretty well and get along with that.''

An <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> employee who refused to give her name said she and fellow workers discovered the bag on a coat rack shortly before 7:30 a.m. The woman said she called federal police in the building and was told to evacuate the office. `` I only saw it from the top,'' she said. `` I've worked here long enough to be suspicious of paper bags.'' Employees said bomb scares occur often at the building. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Cloherty </PERSON> said an occupant of the <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> office had reported `` something in a paper bag that looked like it had electrical components.''

 Wall Street reacted skeptically today to financier <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>'s offer to buy <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, pushing the oil company's stock higher but still well below the $ 60 a share he's touting The stock rose $ 4 to $ 50.87 -LCB- on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, one day after <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s largest investor disclosed the cash offer that values the company at $ 14.6 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> called the proposal a phony `` bear hug'' pressure ploy. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, who bought <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and has chased other big companies such as <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, publicized the offer shortly after <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> management scrapped talks with him over how to restructure following its emergence from bankruptcy court reorganization in April. He disclosed the offer late Wednesday in a letter to <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> management. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> has amassed a 14.8 percent stake in the nation's third-largest oil company, and has been seeking the most profitable way to exploit it Earlier this month, <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, who has said <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> would be worth more broken up and sold, threatened a shareholder proxy fight to install five allies on its board. The company responded by suing him for alleged securities fraud. They began peace talks about three weeks ago. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinnear </PERSON> said the company terminated the discussions Wednesday because of what he called <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>'s unreasonable demands for special treatment in a restructuring. `` <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> will not be bullied or cajoled into recommending to its shareholders a transaction that is not in their best interest or the best interest of the company,'' <PERSON> Kinnear </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Burch </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> made a `` totally inaccurate characterization of the negotiations.'' `` He at all times sought a restructuring that would treat all stockholders equally,'' <PERSON> Burch </PERSON> said. `` We've now proposed a $ 60 cash merger that does treat all shareholders equally.'' Of 243 <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> shares outstanding, <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> owns about 36 million, for which he paid an average $ 34 each or about $ 1.22 billion. Combined with the $ 12.42 billion he offered to pay for the rest, the total offer is worth about $ 13.64 billion. If completed, such an offer would be the biggest in corporate history. The previous record was the 1984 $ 13.4 billion acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> by <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, now <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> said in his letter that he would drop the proxy contest if management would allow other stockholders to consider the offer He gave management until 5 p.m. Friday to think it over. He provided few other details, but said part of his financing plan would include the sale of <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Caltex </ORGANIZATION>, two of <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s most prized assets. `` However, we intend to maintain <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s core business and return it to its rightful place as a leader in its industry, just as we have done with <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Anita </PERSON> <PERSON> Larsen </PERSON> called <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>'s proposal `` an illusory offer which so far as <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> has seen, provides absolutely no details regarding financing, disappears in less than 48 hours, and is put forward as an alternative to allow him to avoid the proxy contest with which he has been threatening the company.'' `` Just a few hours ago he was demanding that <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> help him unload the shares he already owns,'' she said. Company sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> had been hinting at such a move since talks began, and that <PERSON> Kinnear </PERSON> regarded it as a desperate ploy. `` He's been threatening that kind of bear hug,'' said one source. Nevertheless, <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> said in his letter that he was so sure he could obtain financing that he would place $ 100 million in escrow and forfeit it to <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> if he failed to get commitments by the annual shareholders meeting. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> said that in accordance with an agreement with <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> it would delay that meeting from June 7 to June 17, unless the financier withdrew his board slate. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>'s offer came after the close of trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> shares rose $ 1 to $ 46.87 -LCB-. The stock had been falling steadily since the negotiations began. Analysts have estimated the company would be worth between $ 60 and $ 80 a share if it was broken up and sold. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>'s offer was the latest chapter in a troubled <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> saga that began when smaller rival <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> won a $ 10.5 billion judgment against it in 1985, eventually driving <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> into bankruptcy court 13 months ago as part of a strategy to save itself. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> emerged from bankruptcy in April after settling with <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> by paying it $ 3 billion and announcing a drastic restructuring plan that includes the sale of about $ 5 billion in assets.

Republican and Democratic senators hailed the collapse of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> efforts to negotiate <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s departure, and the country's anti-Noriega ambassador said today the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should let Latin Americans solve the problem `` A lot of people are not upset that it fell apart,'' said Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON>, D-Mass., the morning after Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> told a hastily arranged news conference that <PERSON> Noreiga </PERSON> had rejected <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposals for his resignation as defense chief and his temporary departure from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> But <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> said, in an interview on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America,'' that the negotiations to oust <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> hurt <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign policy `` and also sent a terrible message with respect to our ability to do something about the narcotics traffic.'' Sen. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, D-Conn., on `` CBS This Morning,'' urged the administration to start working with Latin American leaders on the matter and said no options for dealing with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> should be ruled out <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> urged Panamanians to `` keep pressure on General <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to realize that he's not safe when he leaves his country and not secure at home either.'' Ambassador <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should hold back and let other initiatives go forward.'' <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration negotiated in good faith but should not have dealt with a terrorist. `` The problem is <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is not an honorable person,'' he said. In another appearance, on <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Today,'' <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON> said, `` I suggest that other initiatives, diplomatic initiatives, political initiatives that are on the drawing boards and are initiatives that Panamanians are putting together with other Latin American countries be given a chance, although I still doubt that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has any intention whatsoever of relinquishing power.'' Reaction to the collapse of the negotiations came as no suprise since criticism of the administration's stand had been widespread well before <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s announcement. The critics included Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials, Panamanian opposition leaders and 86 senators. Perhaps the most biting comment was made by Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif., who expressed no regret at all for the administration's negotiations `` This administration negotiates with the darndest people _ Iranian terrorists and Panamanian drug dealers,'' <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> said. `` I think we should have an administration which does n't negotiate with people like that. `` This administration has handled the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> situation so badly that it is an embarrassment to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' After the negotiations broke down, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> ordered the return of <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> envoy <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said that the negotiating package, worked out laboriously between <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> officials in the last few weeks, has been scrapped. `` No further negotiations are contemplated,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. `` All proposals addressed during these negotiations have been withdrawn. No offers remain on the table.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> refused comment when asked if military solutions are being contemplated. But at the Pentagon, officials insisted there were no plans afoot for direct military intervention in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. For much of the day Wednesday, a deal seemed to be within reach. But <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON> telephoned the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> at 4 p.m. EDT to pass along the news of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s decision. `` At the final moment in negotiations, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> would not carry through with the arrangements his representatives had negotiated,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> told reporters. Under Secretary of State <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Armacost </PERSON> said <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had indicated that `` majors and captains'' within <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> `` might take strong action'' against him if he agreed to the deal. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who has expressed some misgivings at the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's negotiations with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, on Wednesday said that he still was optimistic that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> could be persuaded to step down. `` I'm convinced <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> will be out of power,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> Lakehurst </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> `` The fact that we have n't solved this does n't depress me. `` I do n't want a bad deal. I want a good deal. We'll have to go back and figure it out.'' Senate Republican Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> said that he welcomed <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s announcement. `` <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> must go if we are to achieve our goals in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. But sending <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> off into retirement with a legal golden parachute ... would have been the wrong step at the wrong time.'' This was a reference to the most controversial aspect of the administration's proposal: dismissing federal drug smuggling indictments against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. In February, two federal grand juries in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> indicted <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> on charges of taking at least $ 4.6 million in payoffs from a drug ring based in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, to protect cocaine shipments, launder money and hide drug smugglers from law enforcement officials. In return for the withdrawal of the indictments, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was to step down as commander of the Defense Forces in August and go into exile until after elections for a civilian-led government were held in May 1989. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s view throughout the negotiations was that dismissal of the indictments against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was a small price to pay for his departure from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and the restoration of democratic rule.

 Two bombs exploded in downtown <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> today and injured four whites as the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> marked 40 years in power. A Cabinet minster blamed the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla movement. The attacks in the South African capital coincided with anniversary celebrations by President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s party, responsible for the country's apartheid legislation. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has led the government since the whites-only election of May 26, 1948. Four white women, all librarians in their 30s, were returning from lunch when a bomb exploded in a flowerpot at a busy street corner. One woman lost an arm, a second suffered back injuries and the other two had extensive facial burns, according to a statement from <ORGANIZATION> H.F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Verwoerd </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. About five minutes earlier, a bomb placed under a parked car exploded several blocks away. The car was completely destroyed, but there were no injuries. Witnesses said earlier that at least five people were injured in one blast and that one or two may have been killed, but there was no confirmation of fatalities. There was no immediate claim of responsibility. Law and Order Minister <PERSON> Adriaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> blamed the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, which wages a bombing and sabotage campaign in a bid to overthrow the white-led government. The <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Lusaka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>, generally does not confirm or deny any role in the attacks. <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> also condemned a trip by white South African anti-apartheid politicians who are meeting today and Friday with <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> leaders in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The group is led by <PERSON> Wynand </PERSON> <PERSON> Malan </PERSON>, a member of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and leader of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> said it was `` ironic'' that bombings were taking place at the same time `` people such as <PERSON> Wynand </PERSON> <PERSON> Malan </PERSON> ... are busy holding talks with this unscrupulous terror organization.'' The government opposes all contact with the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> and says it will not negotiate with the organization until it disavows violence. There have been more than 70 bomb blasts in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> since a nationwide state of emergency was declared in June 1986, although the number of explosions has fallen sharply in the past year. The police have blamed virtually all the blasts on the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> did claim responsibility for deadliest bombing in South African history. The May 20, 1983, blast in <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> killed 19 and injured about 200. By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

<DATELINE>ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A 13-year-old who found a wallet stuffed with $ 4,000 on a bus bench treated himself to a six-day adventure at <LOCATION> Disneyland </LOCATION>, police said. The boy told police he had `` a ball,'' <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> Detective <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Cappuccilli </PERSON> said Wednesday. The boy, who was identified only as a resident of nearby Garden Grove because of his age, found the money May 13 and rented a $ 35-a-night motel room in his own name near <LOCATION> Disneyland </LOCATION> for nine days from May 13-21, <PERSON> Cappuccilli </PERSON> said. He spent the next three days at <ORGANIZATION> Disneyland </ORGANIZATION>, buying two skateboards, a watch, a camera and film, a gym bag and new clothes. On his fourth day at the amusement park, the boy lost the $ 2,800 he had left, the detective said. The next day, a 30-year-old man befriended the boy at the park and took him to a car dealership where an employee called police. The boy's parents, who had filed a missing persons report, were reunited with their son May 18, <PERSON> Cappuccilli </PERSON> said. `` The boy knew he probably should have returned the money but said he was having some problems at home and was planning to run away,'' the detective said.

 Authorities do n't suspect foul play in the death of a 79-year-old woman but will exhume her remains more than a month after the funeral on a technicality _ she was buried without a signed death certificate. <ORGANIZATION> Cook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillis </PERSON> ordered the exhumation and an autopsy because the burial of <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Drake </PERSON> was illegal and her estate ca n't be closed without a death certificate, officials said Wednesday. `` Imagine putting yourself in the children's position _ having buried their mother a month ago and then suddenly finding out the death certificate was never signed,'' said <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON>, an attorney for Mrs. <PERSON> Drake </PERSON>'s children, <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Drake </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Sottile </PERSON>. `` They thought they had laid their mother to rest and now she has to be dragged up again,'' he said Wednesday. `` It's a very, very gut-wrenching experience. I do n't know how this could have happened.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Drake </PERSON> was found dead, apparently of natural causes, in her home in suburban <LOCATION> Elmwood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> on April 14, a Thursday, said <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON>, an assistant <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> state's attorney. The county medical examiner's office was not called because police did n't suspect foul play, and the family doctor was expected to sign the death certificate, said <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dames </PERSON>, administrator in the examiner's office. But the funeral home could n't get in touch with the doctor over the weekend and a funeral was planned for Monday morning, said funeral director <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said that he knew that burying a body without a death certificate is a violation of the law but that the funeral home decided to proceed with the funeral anyway, believing the doctor would sign the document after the fact. However, Dr. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Shallat </PERSON> refused to sign, apparently because he had n't seen Mrs. <PERSON> Drake </PERSON> as a patient in four years, said <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON>. <PERSON> Shallat </PERSON> did not return a message left with his answering service Wednesday. The family did n't discover the problem until they began trying to settle her estate in county <ORGANIZATION> Probate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON>. Like the doctor, the medical examiner's office refused to sign the certificate without inspecting the body. `` We ca n't tell what the cause of death is without looking at the body. She might have a gunshot wound to the head for all I know,'' said <PERSON> Dames </PERSON>. <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> said he did n't know whether charges would be filed against the funeral home.

 A strike of ferryboat workers has brought bitter division to this old English Channel port under the famed White Cliffs. A vast majority of the <LOCATION> Dover </LOCATION> seamen of P and O European Ferries, the largest English Channel ferry operator, voted Feb. 2 to strike over new work practices the company wanted to impose. Nearly four months later the walkout remains unresolved, and the 2,220 workers are bitterly divided. One side decided in late April to defy the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seamen </ORGANIZATION> and accept a revised P and O proposal to return to work. The men and women who chose to stay out lost their jobs. Some of those who returned to work have found the word `` Scab'' scrawled in red paint on their homes. Others have reported receiving threatening, anonymous telephone calls. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, mayor of the city of about 40,000 people, fears <LOCATION> Dover </LOCATION> will feel the pain longer after the strike is settled. `` You're going to get splits in the community'' he said. `` People are having to make hard decisions. `` People rely on each other in an emergency out there when there is a 10-force gale,'' he added. `` People will remember who did n't back them up in a strike. P and O, which is refusing further negotiations with the union, says 1,100 former strikers are back on the job. The union says it's only 250 Violence broke out on the picket lines April 29, when P and O operated two of its 11 ferries with strikebreaking crews. The company says it now is operating five vessels, two carrying passengers and three carrying freight, and has brought its work force back to 65 percent of its previous level by hiring from a pool of 8,000 outsiders. `` What has happened here is a tragedy,'' said striker <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON>. `` I wo n't speak to them -LRB- the strikebreakers -RRB- ever again. They betrayed us. They are traitors.'' The strikers say they wo n't accept the new work rules _ namely more shifts _ on grounds that they jeopardize ferry safety The loss of 193 lives, including ferry crewmen, in last year's sinking of the P and O's <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> off <LOCATION> Zeebrugge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, had a profound effect on <LOCATION> Dover </LOCATION>, whose principal industry is its port, which goes back to Roman times But P and O insists nothing in its work proposals is unsafe and that safety is a paramount issue with the company. P and O maintains it needs the new work practices to make it more competitive with the new English Channel rail tunnel, which will offer speedier travel between <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> when it opens in 1993. The strikers, however, believe P and O is trying to destroy their union with the backing of Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s Conservative government <LOCATION> Dover </LOCATION> residents who support the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> feel intensely that the chairman of the parent P and <ORGANIZATION> O </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navigation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, Sir <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Sterling </PERSON>, has benefitted from Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s capitalist policies Although <LOCATION> Dover </LOCATION>'s economy has been hurt by the walkout, large segments of the community appear to back the strikers. `` It's always been a seafaring town, so these seamen have a lot of support,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, a taxi driver. Mayor <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said shopkeepers donate food to the strikers, who have set up soup kitchens to guarantee that the seamen and their families get at least one hot meal a day. The seamen, who made the equivalent of $ 20,500 to $ 31,600 a year, are having to make do now with a total of about $ 372 in strike payments from their union. Crewmen who have gone back to work avoid talking about it to reporters. `` There are too many reprisals,'' said the wife of one, shrinking away from her front door. The first crews to go back to work issued a statement saying their decision was based on a desire to save the company from being sold to foreigners, that they did n't want outsiders to get their jobs and that the strike was undemocratic. Hundreds of picketers still wait at the entrance of the docks every morning for company buses ferrying strikebreakers. Shouting with fists raised, they have persuaded a handful of workers, a few of them in tears, to get off and join them on the picket line.

 Indian troops backed by helicopter gunships attacked Tamil rebel camps in northern <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> on Thursday in an offensive that has killed 30 rebels and 10 soldiers, an Indian official said. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> news agency said 6,000 Indian troops were involved in the offensive, which began Tuesday near the fishing village of <LOCATION> Mullaitivu </LOCATION>, 170 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>. An official at the <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said at least 30 Tamil fighters were killed and 39 injured since Tuesday. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said 10 Indian troops were killed and 21 wounded in the operation. In a radio broadcast, Tamils put the rebel death toll at eight. One rebel spokesman, whose uses the nom de guerre <PERSON> Dinesh </PERSON>, said that 25 Indian soldiers had been killed. The figures could not be independently verified because communications with the town have been cut. `` The operation ... is still on,'' the Indian official said. The rebels, who are fighting for an independent Tamil homeland, have used the village as a smuggling base, Indian officials said. The offensive was the largest <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has launched since Oct. 10, when Indian troops fought two weeks to capture the northern <LOCATION> Jaffna </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> from the rebels. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has sent more than 50,000 troops to the island to enforce an Indian-sponsored peace accord signed July 29. The pact signed by <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> was aimed at ending a nearly five-year insurgency by Tamil rebels. Tamils, who are mostly Hindus and make up 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million population, claim they are discriminated against by the majority <PERSON> Sinhalese </PERSON> <PERSON> Buddhists </PERSON>, who control the government and the military. The <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eelam </ORGANIZATION>, the largest rebel group, has rejected the peace accord and vowed to continue its guerrilla struggle for an independent homeland in the north and east of the island, where most Tamils live. The <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> have been operating from jungle bases since the <LOCATION> Jaffna </LOCATION> offensive and still conduct hit-and-run raids on the Indian forces. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> is involved because its own 60 million ethnic Tamils are sympathetic to their Sri Lankan brethren. Before the latest offensive, more than 435 Indian soldiers had died since the troops were sent to the island July 30.

 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is likely to benefit only indirectly from President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s summit next week with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, scholars and political observers say. Whereas <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had a role in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> summit last December, the vice president will be far from the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> drama, meeting privately with <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders at his home in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, as many may remember, stood at <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s side during an improptu stop the Soviet leader made at a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> street corner. The <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit may present for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> another in the series of Catch-22-type problems that have followed his quest for the White House. The thinking is that if something goes wrong in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will be held as accountable as <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. But if there is some surprising positive development, the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people will give <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> credit. `` The truth is, he probably should gain something from the summit and he probably wo n't,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabato </PERSON>, a presidential scholar at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION>. `` I just do n't think it's going to make any difference for him because he's not going there,'' <PERSON> Sabato </PERSON> said. `` Besides, he seems to be having all the good things -LRB- in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> record -RRB- roll off, and all the bad things stick, these days.'' But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign aides hope the vice presient gets some advantage from the Reagan-Gorbachev summit. Communications director <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Teeley </PERSON> said that `` whatever you get out of the thing is going to depend on the accomplishments, the mood and the tone.'' <PERSON> Sabato </PERSON>, <PERSON> Teeley </PERSON> and others said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will almost surely benefit, to a certain degree, if the summit proceeds without incident or problems. They said that he would be credited with being a part of an administration that is advancing the prospects of peace and easing tensions with the Soviets. `` Much of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> public believes that relations between these two countries are getting better, so the -LRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> -RRB- experience factor is important,'' <PERSON> Teeley </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in fact, met with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> before <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> ascended to the top <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> position, and the vice president attended the funerals of fallen <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> leaders <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>, <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Andropov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Konstantin </PERSON> <PERSON> Chernenko </PERSON>. On the campaign trail, he's fond of telling how he observed <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>'s wife doing the sign of the cross as she hovered over his dead body. During the December summit, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made a big play over his one-on-one meeting with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> at the Soviet Embassy. Pictures were taken as the pair sat smiling on a sofa, and the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign depicted the vice president as a person who would provide continuity in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dealings with the Soviets. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON>, a presidential scholar at <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said the chief advantage the summit presents to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is that `` it basically takes a critical issue from the Democrats _ the fear of war with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. It takes a scary world and makes it less scary.'' But <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would gain a much greater advantage if he were to attend the summit, and said modern communications and other precautions could remove the obstacles to both the president and vice president being together on foreign soil. But he said `` I do n't see the people around the president being willing to share the glory'' with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> if there is some stunning accomplishment there. `` We know that the vice president is in the worst of all possible situations,'' <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> said., `` He can not take credit for the administration's successes and he has to share the blame for its failures. Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Leach </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Iowa </LOCATION>, a former aide when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, claimed it was <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> who talked the West German government into accepting Pershing II missiles, even though there was a burgeoning anti-nuclear movement in that country and Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> was under tremendous political pressure. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have said they believe the Soviets would never have come to the table to negotiate an intermediate-range missile treaty had it not been for the willingness of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and other <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> allies to have <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> missiles placed on their soil. <PERSON> Leach </PERSON> said that because `` the personal dimensions of summits are almost always presidential,'' it would be difficult for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to get close enough to center stage to get a big political bounce at home. <PERSON> Sabato </PERSON> said, `` If politics were fair, I think he ought to get some credit, just because the summit is happening.

<HEAD>U.S. To Urge Soviets To Seek Cuban Withdrawal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA </BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The superpower summit in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> next week is expected to include a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> appeal to Soviet leaders to promote a peaceful settlement in southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> by encouraging the withdrawal of Cuban forces in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. Following an unsually intense period of diplomatic exchanges, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say they see the southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> issue as the Third World conflict that offers the best hope for a settlement. It is not clear how much personal attention President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will pay to the issue but other officials said that, at a mimimum, it will be discussed at lower levels. Under Secretary of State <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Armacost </PERSON> said last week that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been seeking from the Soviets use of their influence with <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> `` to encourage a realistic and prompt timetable'' for the withdrawal of Cuban forces. According to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> estimates, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> has increased by at least 6,000 its troop strength in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> to between 43,000 and 45,000 over the past several months. It also has deployed its forces to within a few miles of the border with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> African-controlled </LOCATION> <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, also known as <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, for the first time. Aside from the Cuban troop issue, the administration also has been asking the Soviets to promote a process of national reconciliation between the Marxist government in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and the U.S.-backed rebel group, <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION>. The two sides have been at war for almost 13 years. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> sent up to 3,000 troops into <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> last year in support of <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> although Angolan estimates of <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>'s involvement have been much higher With Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON> playing the key role, the administration has for years been attempting to promote the withdrawal of all foreign forces from southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> _ Cubans from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africans </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. As the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sees it, this would free the area of both superpower competition and colonialism, enabling the region to concentrate on development after years of warfare. <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> is <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s last colony. The administration has been calling for parallel movement on both the Angolan and Namibian issues. The stumbling block thus far is that while the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africans </LOCATION> have agreed to turn <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> over to an independent government under a one-year timetable outlined in a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> resolution, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> has proposed a <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> departure from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> over a four-year time frame. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> believes the Angolan timetable is excessive. With <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has said it will not relinquish control over <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> unless there is an early timetable for a full Cuban withdrawal from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. As described by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, the principal Soviet advantage in encouraging a peaceful settlement is that the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> would be spared continued large-scale losses of military equipment. The South African military has said that during a 1987 Angolan offensive against <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> and South African forces, Soviet-made equipment losses included eight MiG 23s, four MiG 21s, eight helicopters and 94 tanks, among other items. But the Cuban military has said that in recent fighting, a South African escalation was given a `` firm, decisive and crushing response.'' <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> has defended its presence in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> as an effort to protect that country against `` racist aggression'' by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Lately, the pace of diplomacy has increased. Earlier this month, officials from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> met in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to explore the possibilities for a settlement. The parties expressed satisfaction with the outcome of the unprecedented encounter and agreed to meet again.

<TEXT>
 Senior <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> advisers urged superpower leaders Thursday to bury remaining Cold War differences and praised President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s comment that he heads to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on a mission of peace. The task at next week's summit is to bury `` this corpse of the Cold War, which with the help of artificial means ... has been maintained in a semi-living state,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> affairs expert <PERSON> Georgy </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Arbatov </PERSON>, one of several foreign affairs advisers who predicted improved U.S.-Soviet relations in a meeting with reporters. The state-run press also painted a rosy picture of superpower ties. The labor newspaper Trud invoked <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> public opinion in pressing for a successful summit, claiming most Americans want better relations with the Soviets. And Socialist Industry declared that the two nations have entered a `` political thaw.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> arrives Sunday for five days of meetings with <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. It will be the fourth summit between the two leaders. `` Previously, our goals were more limited,'' said <PERSON> Arbatov </PERSON>, observing that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in the past focused on easing tensions built up since World War II. `` Now we have the possibility to move toward demilitarization of Soviet-American relations,'' he said. Asked about <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s comment Wednesday that he viewed his journey to the Soviet capital as a mission of peace, <PERSON> Arbatov </PERSON> smiled and replied: `` I think there is something symbolic in this, that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is now coming with an olive branch to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>.'' He said his view of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had changed from that of a Cold Warrior to a statesman. But <PERSON> Arbatov </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had brought about the improvement by coming around to the Soviet way of thinking on disarmament and international relations. Marshal <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Akhromeyev </PERSON>, military chief of staff and first deputy defense minister, joined in the spirit of `` new thinking,'' as the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> refers to the force behind its foreign policy shifts over the three years since <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> came to power. <PERSON> Akhromeyev </PERSON> declared himself a `` completely different person'' as a result of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms and said many other officials are experiencing the same feeling. But he clung to standard Kremlin positions alleging that there is no Soviet superiority in conventional weapons in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> or excessive spending on arms. But asked for details on Soviet defense spending, <PERSON> Akhromeyev </PERSON> made the rare acknowledgement that the reported defense budget does not reflect spending on research, development and production of weapons. <PERSON> Akhromeyev </PERSON> declined to say how much of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s gross national product is invested in defense, claiming he was privy only to the budget approved by the Supreme Soviet, which amounts to about 5 percent of government spending. That would put it at about $ 33.9 billion. Western estimates have put Soviet defense spending as high as 19 percent of the gross national product, which measures the value of all goods and services produced in a nation. <PERSON> Arbatov </PERSON> dismissed foreign assessments as `` speculation'' but said Soviet spending on the military is proportionally higher than in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> because the Soviet gross national product is lower, while the demands of security are equal. Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrovsky </PERSON> told reporters that the talks would help in `` overcoming the heritage of the Cold War.'' All of the advisers contended that the Reagan-Gorbachev meetings could produce important advances in negotiations toward a treaty that would halve <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet strategic nuclear arsenals.

 A federal judge has thrown out the 1974 murder conviction of a black death-row inmate in the slaying of a white policeman, ruling that blacks and women were improperly excluded from the jury. <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> X. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, now 48, was convicted by a <LOCATION> Colquitt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> jury of 12 white men in the shooting death of <LOCATION> Moultrie </LOCATION> police Lt. <PERSON> Tommie </PERSON> <PERSON> Meredith </PERSON>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Dudley </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON>, in a ruling made public Wednesday, said blacks and women were intentionally excluded from the pools used in selecting the grand jury that indicted him and the trial jury that convicted him. The judge said there is no evidence that the lack of blacks and women was due to `` neutral selection criteria and procedures.'' <PERSON> Lamar </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>, district attorney in the state's <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judicial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION>, said he will seek to re-indict <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, was scheduled for execution after <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>'s new capital punishment law was upheld by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in 1976, but the condemned man's appeals delayed the execution. <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>' younger brother, <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, testified at his trial that <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> was the trigger man in the slaying. <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> served a prison term for kidnapping and robbery and was released in 1987.

<TEXT>
 A man shot a woman he apparently mistook for his wife, offered to take her to a hospital, then killed himself with a shot to the head, authorities said. `` We're going on the assumption that it was a case of mistaken identity,'' <LOCATION> Marshall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's Capt. <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Amos </PERSON> said after the shootings Wednesday. Officials said <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowman </PERSON>, 32, shot <PERSON> Marsha </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Atchley </PERSON>, 26, at <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guntersville </LOCATION>. She was in fair condition Thursday at <ORGANIZATION> Carraway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think he realized just what a mistake he had made, and he could n't handle that,'' police Lt. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Fulmer </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Atchley </PERSON>, of <PERSON> Arab </PERSON>, told witnesses she had never before seen the man who shot her once in the chest with a .32 - caliber Witnesses said the woman was in a bathing suit and lying on a chaise lounge at a lake when <PERSON> Bowman </PERSON> drove up, walked over to her and knelt beside her. `` One witness said he heard the woman scream and then heard a gunshot,'' <PERSON> Amos </PERSON> said. `` She begged <PERSON> Bowman </PERSON> not to shoot her again, and he told her it was all a mistake and then asked her if he could take her to the hospital.'' Ms. <PERSON> Atchley </PERSON> refused and walked to her car and got in, <PERSON> Amos </PERSON> said, while <PERSON> Bowman </PERSON> walked back to his truck. <PERSON> Fulmer </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bowman </PERSON> traveled about one-third of a mile, then `` pulled out a gun and shot himself in the head while the truck was moving.'' He said the truck traveled about 300 more yards before stopping in a ditch. <PERSON> Bowman </PERSON> apparently was upset that a warrant charging him with parole violation was issued Wednesday. If convicted, he would have faced serving the remaining three years of a 10-year sentence for the Aug. 23, 1980, robbery of a package store. He was paroled about a year ago and had fulfilled all the requirements of his parole until this month, parole Officer <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said. On May 3, <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said, he was arrested and charged with public intoxication, assault and harassment of his wife. He was found guilty on May 9. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said that was sufficient cause to revoke his parole and issue a warrant for his arrest.

 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiators worked today to clear away the remaining obstacles to a U.S.-Soviet treaty banning medium-range nuclear missiles and headed toward almost certain approval of the first arms-control treaty to be ratified in 16 years. Meetings on the remaining issues resumed today between the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s leaders and senior members of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> and Intelligence committees. `` I'm very optimistic about finishing this matter,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., who noted that the areas of disagreement had been whittled down to two or three `` I'm confident that everybody is going in the same direction,'' he said The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, on a vote of 96-0, today approved an amendment incorporating into the treaty agreements reached two weeks ago in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> by Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, dealing with warheads using `` futuristic'' technology and clarifying on-site verification rules. Leaders had conferred late into Wednesday night in an effort to settle what appeared to be the thorniest dispute, one between the administration and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> over possible future reinterpretation of the treaty. `` We're not there yet, but we've made a good deal of progress,'' said Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. Va.. A key to progress on the treaty was the decision on Wednesday by the leading opponent of the pact, Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, to drop his <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> said he did so in the face of a probable vote by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to shut off debate. `` That was the end of it,'' <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> conceded in a floor speech. `` I've had no illusions about defeating this treaty. The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people are beginning to understand that this is a dangerous treaty.'' <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>' concession ended more than a week of delay and raised hopes that the accord could be approved in time to be shipped to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> so that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> could formally exchange ratification documents with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> at the summit meeting that begins Sunday. The primary remaining issue did not affect the treaty itself, but the modified conditions under which the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> would grant its consent. Democrats sought to attach a condition stipulating that any attempt by a future president to reinterpret the treaty would have to be approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in order to become effective. Backers of the change have said it is an attempt to preserve the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s constitutional power of advise and consent on treaties. The debate stems from a dispute with the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration over its attempt to reinterpret the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty to permit more latitude in developing <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s Star Wars missile defense. That treaty with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was the last arms-control pact to win <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approval. The treaty on intermediate-range nuclear forces, which <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> signed in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Dec. 8, requires elimination within three years of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> nuclear missiles with a range of 300 miles to 3,400 miles. It would result in the elimination of 867 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> missiles in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and elimination of 1,752 Soviet missiles. While the treaty is regarded as militarily insignificant because it leaves most of both sides' nuclear arsenals intact, it holds potentially great political significance as a model for a follow-up treaty to provide for deep cuts in long-range nuclear missiles. As leaders wrangled throughout the day Wednesday in an effort to clear remaining procedural hurdles, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved a pair of relatively mild amendments to the accord and overwhelmingly defeated two others. On a voice vote, the lawmakers approved a non-binding provision urging negotiators in future talks on reductions in long-range missile arsenals not to give up the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> right to maintain stocks of conventionally armed air - and sea-launched cruise missiles And the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> urged the president to keep human rights in the forefront of U.S.-Soviet relations and `` insist on sustained and demonstrable human rights progress.'' That language was added on a voice vote. <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> was rebuffed in an attempt to add a provision stipulating that if either side provided `` materially misleading or false data,'' the other side would be free to withdraw from the treaty. The amendment failed on a vote of 89-9. And Sen. <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION>, failed on a 69-28 vote to win an exemption from the ban for conventionally armed cruise missiles. <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON> argued that keeping such missiles in the allied arsenal would help offset <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact superiority in conventional forces, but opponents pointed out it would be impossible to verify that the missiles were not nuclear-tipped.

 Seismic technology is sensitive enough to confidently monitor all but the smallest Soviet underground nuclear tests, a congressional scientific study said Thursday. The conclusions could help to reach a ban on all underground testing, one of the unresolved issues between the two superpowers, said Rep. <PERSON> Dante </PERSON> <PERSON> Fascell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Fascell </PERSON> called the study `` an important contribution'' to the effort to develop a test ban. The study, carried out by the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assessment </ORGANIZATION>, an arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, was released as President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> rested in <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, while en route to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will travel to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> this weekend for his fourth summit with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, and one of the issues on the agenda is underground nuclear testing. The two leaders are expected to sign a pair of protocols designed to improve monitoring procedures. Open-air tests are banned by a 1963 treaty, while two separate treaties, signed in 1974 and 1976, limit underground tests to 150 kilotons. Both sides claim to adhere to the 1970s accords, although neither treaty has been formally ratified by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has promised to submit the pacts to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> if adequate verification procedures can be worked out. The two protocols will set the ground rules for joint experiments this summer in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Semipalatinsk </LOCATION> to measure the force of detonations. The Soviets want to use seismic monitoring systems, similar to the kind used to watch for earthquakes. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> prefers a system known as CORRTEX, which involves inserting a cable in a shaft about 30 feet from the test hole and taking measuresment from it. The <ORGANIZATION> OTA </ORGANIZATION> study said `` seismology now provides a means to monitor underground nuclear explosions down to low yields, even when strenuous attempts are made to evade the monitoring systems. By doing so, seismology plays a central role in verifying arms control agreements that limit the testing of nuclear weapons.'' Seismic monitoring systems, even if none of the stations are in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, can readily monitor tests down to the 10-kiloton level `` with high confidence,'' the study said. In fact, `` expert opinion about the lowest yields that could reliably be monitored ranges from 1 kiloton to 10 kilotons,'' the study said. One kiloton has the explosive force of 1,000 tons of TNT. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> atomic bomb dropped Aug. 6, 1945 on <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, had an explosive force of about 20 kilotons. Once a seismic signal is detected by the underground monitoring stations, <ORGANIZATION> OTA </ORGANIZATION> said, its source could be reliably tracked down. `` Over 90 percent of all seismic events in the U.S.S.R can be classified as earthquakes simply becuase they are either toop dee or not in a plausible location for a nuclear explosion,'' the study said. `` The combination of all methods, when applied in a comprehensive approach, can differentiate between with explosions, down to low yields, and earthquakes.'' The report also looked at a comprehensive test ban, saying it `` could be considered adequately verifiable if it were determined that the advantage of such a treaty would outweigh the significance of any undetected clandestine testing belo the monitoring threshold.'' A total test ban has long been a goal of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms control advocates and the Soviets have recently backed such a restriction. For 18 months ending in February 1987 the Soviets unilaterally suspended all testing, but the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration declined to join the moratorium. In each of the past two years, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> has voted to ban atomic tests above the one-kilton level, but the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> rejected such a ban and the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> has strongly opposed the limitation. <ORGANIZATION> OTA </ORGANIZATION> suggested that a phased approach could be adopted setting the first step at 10 kilotons. `` This is a level that can currently be well monitored seismically,'' the study said.

 Rebel and Sandinista government leaders started a new round of talks today aimed at ending their 6 -LCB- - year war, and the rebels said they were proposing a peace plan focusing on democratic reforms The rebels, who have been supported by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government, said they would lay down their arms and rejoin the political life of the country if the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> guarantee democratization. At the center of the proposal is the demand that the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> ease their control over the army and government. The rebels, also known as Contras, also ask for constitional reforms, freedom of expression and freedom of the press. `` We are not optimistic,'' however, said <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON>, leader of the Nicaraguan Resistance rebel delegation. Gen. <PERSON> Humberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, the nation's defense minister, led the government delegation to the third round of top-level peace talks held in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. Tight security was in effect at the Camino Real Hotel, where the negotiators met. The witnesses are <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> Cardinal <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> y Bravo and <PERSON> Joao </PERSON> <PERSON> Baena </PERSON> <PERSON> Soares </PERSON>, secretary general of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION>. The rebel plan sets a flexible timetable that eventually would have Contra fighters lay down their arms before Christmas. The government said it was ready to offer political reforms to guarantee clean elections. It offered to give congressional representation to parties not in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, to set a timetable for municipal and other elections, and to change the makeup of the electoral council to assure `` pluralistic representation.'' <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> told reporters late Wednesday, `` We have come here to present a comprehensive proposal to the government for a global solution to the war.'' The rebels, he said, were prepared to make a `` special effort to achieve a definitive cease-fire.'' But he said he was not optimistic because the government has not complied with a preliminary peace plan worked out March 23 in <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION>, a small village on the Costa Rican border. The rebel delegation arrived Wednesday evening, ending a dispute over where the talks would be held. The rebels had refused to return to <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, the site of two previous sessions. They complained the government restricted their access to opposition political leaders. The government insisted the talks be held in the capital and agreed to let the rebels meet with the opposition Nicaraguan Democratic Coordinate and visit the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> bishops' conference, the opposition newspaper <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> and relatives Col. <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON>, the rebel military leader, arrived from <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, to take part in the negotiations, marking his first trip to <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> since the war started in late 1981. `` My presence here is due to the fact that I'm a Nicaraguan and that I'm opposed to the state of affairs in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>,'' he told a news conference. `` I have come here to try to see <PERSON> Sapoa </PERSON> fulfilled, to discuss a cease-fire and an end to the war because this is my country,'' he said. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, an aide to <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, said on Tuesday the rebels planned to offer to disarm themselves by Sept. 1. The two sides earlier agreed to a 60-day cease-fire to give them time to arrange a permanent truce. The cease-fire was to expire on May 30, but President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> announced earlier in the week that he would extend it for an additional 30 days. <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> told reporters the rebels do not want repeated extensions of the cease-fire, but rather a permanent halt to the fighting. If the cease-fire ends on May 30, he said, the rebels will take up `` defensive positions'' but will not break the truce. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> says the war has killed 26,500 people and caused $ 3 billion in damage to the economy. A major obstacle to agreement has been the question of how non-lethal aid will be delivered to rebels gathered in cease-fire zones inside <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. Under the <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION> agreement, the aid was to come through a neutral international organization. Contras insisted in the talks that they had the right to choose the organization. Contra leaders were quoted as saying they would accept a proposal for delivery of humanitarian aid to their forces inside <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> by an agency with ties to the Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

 A small, <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> college has won a reprieve from liquidation, but will have to come up with a plan by June 3 to repay its $ 20 million debt, a federal judge has ordered. Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON> acted in response to a motion from <ORGANIZATION> Bishop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>'s attorneys to quash his March order that would have changed the college's status from Chapter 11 reorganization to Chapter 7 liquidation as of Wednesday. That would have closed the 107-year-old, predominantly black school. <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON> said Wednesday he would set a hearing on the reorganization plan for creditors for the week of June 27, with a confirmation hearing the week of July 25. The plan would take effect Aug. 15 and school officials promised they would raise enough money to pay for the entire 1988-89 school year. Officials said without that money in hand, <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> would not open in the fall. `` In order for the community to regain confidence, we need to show we are fiscally responsible,'' said <PERSON> Trip </PERSON> <PERSON> Finley </PERSON>, a Bishop attorney. `` But we not only have to convince our creditors, but also the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>.'' He said <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> will be re-evaluated by the association this fall for its accreditation. In March, <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON> ruled the 300-student college could remain open on the condition officials raised at least $ 50,000 every two weeks. The ruling further stipulated that without a substantial change in the college's finances, <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> would be ordered to liquidate its assets to repay $ 20 million owed 400 creditors. School officials say <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> has raised more than $ 617,000 in two months and has pledges for $ 158,000 more. <PERSON> Finley </PERSON> said it will take seven to 10 years to repay all the school's debts. The college has failed to meet Chapter 11 obligations to keep all bills current, said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> McElreath </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION> trustee overseeing the case. But he conceded the school had complied with the $ 50,000 bi-monthly payments since March and officials seemed willing to work out the remaining debt. <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Swift </PERSON>, who represents the <ORGANIZATION> Faculty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said she was concerned that faculty members had not been paid about $ 500,000 in back salary and wages. But <PERSON> Finley </PERSON> said a $ 125,000 payment to the salaries was made Wednesday and that school officials hoped to pay $ 122,000 more _ the usual payroll _ from the next funds received.

 An FEB agent told a congressional hearing today the government did not entrap <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Alcee </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> when it was investigating allegations of bribery involving him and a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lawyer. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who headed the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s investigation in the case, said the federal government attempted to determine the truth of the allegations made by an informant who said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> A </PERSON>. Borders had bragged that he could bribe several judges, including <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>. `` We were only trying to prove or disprove what -LRB- the informant -RRB- said,'' <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> judiciary subcommittee holding impeachment hearings on <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>. Rep. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>, R-Ga., said the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> had no evidence against <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>, only the informant's statement about Borders `` Is n't this a classic textbook entrapment?'' he asked. Borders was arrested after an undercover agent allegedly gave him $ 120,000 in $ 100 bills in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to bribe <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> into giving a lenient sentence to two men on trial before him in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. `` Would there have been a crime had the federal government not given Borders the money?'' <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> asked. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said Borders approached the informant `` and he laid out to -LRB- him -RRB- what he would be able to do.'' <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said the undercover meeting with Borders, when the money was exchanged, `` was a tool to respond to -LRB- the informant's -RRB- allegations. If Borders did n't show up at the meeting and did n't say the things he did, the case would have stopped `` The information we were trying to prove or disprove was that Borders and Judge <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> were going to do a crime,'' he said. `` We did n't decide one day in the office to get Judge <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>.'' Borders refused to testify Wednesday at a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> subcommittee </ORGANIZATION>'s televised impeachment proceedings against <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>, citing his Fifth Amendment guarantee against self-incrimination. After serving 33 months of a five-year sentence in federal prison, paying a $ 35,000 fine and being disbarred by the <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Borders </PERSON> said, `` I believe that my legal debt to society expired on May 22, 1988, after my release from parole.'' Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Mich., the chairman of the inquiry, said the subcommittee will decide later whether to grant Borders immunity from prosecution and compel his testimony <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> was acquitted five years ago of conspiring with Borders to solicit a bribe from two convicted racketeers, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Romano </PERSON>, in exchange for the promise of a lenient sentence. But a special five-judge investigative panel of the 11th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> concluded in September 1986 there was `` clear and convincing evidence'' that <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> committed the crime and tried to conceal his role by lying under oath and manufacturing evidence at his trial. <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> insists that he knew nothing of the bribery plot and accuses Borders of using his name in an attempt to shake down the <PERSON> Romano </PERSON> brothers. <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> was allowed Wednesday to cross-examine the two fellow judges who filed misconduct charges against him six weeks after his acquittal. One of them, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Terrell </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodges </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, said it was a `` gut-wrenching decision'' to file the complaint, and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Alaimo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Brunswick </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Hodges </PERSON> was `` on the verge of tears.'' Retorted <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>: `` I've cried a lot, <PERSON> Tony </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>, who is <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s first black federal judge, has charged repeatedly that his prosecution was racially and politically motivated. But <PERSON> Hodges </PERSON> told the subcommittee that <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>' race had `` absolutely not'' any bearing on his decision to file a complaint. <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON>, laying the groundwork for <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>'s testimony, said it was `` amazing'' that <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents arrested Borders and seized $ 125,000 in bribe money before Borders had a chance to pass it along to anyone else. <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> was staying at a hotel a couple of miles away when Borders was arrested Oct. 9, 1981, inside a car with the payoff money supplied by an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> undercover agent posing as <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Romano </PERSON>. The judicial panel said that when <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> learned of Borders' arrest, he hurriedly flew back to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> from a <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> airport because he wanted to avoid questioning by <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Doar </PERSON>, chief counsel to the judicial panel, said there was sufficient circumstantial evidence to implicate <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> in a conspiracy. But he agreed with Rep. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, D-Calif., that the case against <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> would have been `` almost impregnable'' if he had actually received bribe money from Borders A few hours after Borders' arrest, <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> was to have appeared at a boating party given by lawyer friends in Borders' honor.

<HEAD>Weekly Doses of Cancer-Fighting Drug Safe for Arthritis</HEAD>

 A potent cancer-fighting can safely relieve symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis in patients unresponsive to other medication, a doctor reported today. The drug, Methotrexate, has been used to treat arthritis in the past, but daily use is thought to cause cirhosis of the liver. Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brick </PERSON>, assistant professor of medicine at <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>, said in a report at a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rheumatism </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> that weekly doses of the drug were found to be safe in a 1980-87 study of 96 patients. Mild and moderate amounts of fat and inflammation were found to be common in the livers of patients with rheumatoid arthritis even before they were treated with Methotrexate, <PERSON> Brick </PERSON> said. `` After treatment, these abnormalities increased in some patients but seemed to decrease in others,'' <PERSON> Brick </PERSON> said. `` None of the patients developed cirrhosis as a result of Methotrexate therapy.'' `` We believe our data indicates that Methotrexate can be safely given, from an hepatic standpoint, to selected patients with rheumatoid arthritis for a period of several years,'' he said. Treatment for people with rheumatoid arthritis ordinarily involves a combination of medication, physical therapy, education and surgery. Patients that are unresponsive or intolerant to the simplest drugs progressively receive more potent medications such as Methotrexate.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> today abruptly canceled one of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s meetings with General Secretary <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and questioned the composition of a religious group scheduled to meet with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. But a White House spokesman said the session at the <PERSON> Danilov </PERSON> monastery was `` going to proceed as scheduled.'' The spokesman, <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> <PERSON> Popadiuk </PERSON>, said the decision to scrub one of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s meetings with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was `` mutual.'' However, on the president's flight Wednesday from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, chief spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> put the cancellation differently. He said the Soviets had suggested dropping a meeting and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> side was trying to clarify the reason. Despite the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s efforts to smooth over any differences, the schedule change and rumors that the Soviets were attempting to restrict access to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> contributed a measure of uncertainty to his fourth summit meeting with the general secretary. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, meanwhile, passed the day relaxing and keeping his distance from the hundreds of reporters following in his footsteps. A brief press notice said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and his wife <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> strolled along a lake near their guest house. During the 30-minute walk the president skipped stones along the water, the press release said. The session, called off because of what the Soviets cited as `` some internal function,'' was one of five that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had scheduled over four days with his <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. Overall, the president still will spend six hours with the Soviet leader because the remaining sessions will be expanded, said <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. `` I regard it as routine,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, as <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> spent the day in seclusion at a government guesthouse making preparations for his talks in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The summit encountered another glitch when word reached the presidential party taking a rest stop in <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> that the Soviets had questioned the participation of one of the religious groups due to meet with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> at a monestary on Monday. `` The meeting itself is still on as far as I know,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. He said he did not know which religious group might be excluded. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also plans to meet separately with a group of Jewish `` refuseniks'' who had been unable to obtain exit permits for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said he was unable to verify a report that two of them had been intercepted by Soviet authorities on their way to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>. On the official level, the Soviets have shown no concern over the meeting planned between <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet refuseniks. At a press conference to discuss the forthcoming summit, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> affairs expert <PERSON> Georgy </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Arbatov </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Shishlin </PERSON> both stated that they considered <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s meeting partners his own business <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s first visit to the country he once denounced as `` the evil empire'' was already clouded by failure of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> effort to oust Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, the military ruler of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. After the summit, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will preside at the first full-fledged <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> conference since 1941, but there was no immediate word on whether the cancellation of the second of Reagan-Gorbachev sessions on Monday had any connection with the party meetings. For the Soviets, the party conference has tended to overshadow <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s fourth summit meeting with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, since it will serve as a test of the Soviet leader's economic reform policies and his three years at the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> helm. At the same time, the summit itself has lost any expectation of major results with the failure of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet negotiators to complete a treaty to sharply reduce long-range nuclear weapons. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> had hoped to make such an accord the centerpiece of the 77-year-old president's first trip to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. In an interview Tuesday with a group of West European jouralists, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> left open the possibility of a fifth summit with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> before he leaves office in January _ if negotiators can complete the treaty to reduce strategic nuclear weapons. `` I wo n't rule it out,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in a text released here today. `` I wo n't say it's impossible ... I would hope that we can iron out the still undecided points before I leave..'' Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> joined <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on his summit trip early today, carrying a full report on the collapse of negotiations to remove <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> from power <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> was greeted briefly and without ceremony by Finnish Foreign Minister <PERSON> Kalevi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sorsa </PERSON> before climbing into a black limousine for the 15-minute ride to the guest house where <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was staying. `` I do n't feel weakened,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had assured reporters after his post-midnight landing. But he seemed disappointed _ and at a loss on what he might try next to force out <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> had stayed behind to supervise the negotiations held in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> between <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. Apparently, the general's aides had given the impression the deal would go through, but <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> turned <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON> down and the emissary was ordered home. `` It seemed for a time as if he had some plan ...,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, his voice trailing off, `` but evidently he changed his mind about this.'' Asked what he might do next, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, `` That's going to take some studying and consultation.'' Evidently, any serious planning will have to take a back seat to the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s first visit to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, beginning on Sunday. In any event, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said: `` No other negotiations are planned. No agreement has been left on the table.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic sanctions against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> would remain in place. Earlier, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> seemed to expect a positive outcome in the negotiations. `` ` We can hear something at any time,'' he told reporters aboard Air Force One. Under the proposed deal, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> would have left <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> this summer and not returned until after elections were held in May 1989. The president also was hoping for word from <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> that the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> had ratified his treaty to abolish <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> nuclear missiles in the range of 300 miles to 3,400 miles. Another key aide, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the White House chief of staff, stayed behind to oversee maneuvering by <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democratic and <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> leaders to choke off debate and bring <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s only nuclear arms control agreement to a vote before the president opens talks with General Secretary <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> on Sunday. If the administration's strategy is successful, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> will fly the ratified pact to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Saturday so <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> can have a formal exchange of the documents. The Supreme Soviet, the nominal parliament, endorsed the treaty on Monday and sent it to the Presidium, the highest executive body, for ratification. <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON>, head of the foreign ministry's arms control office, said the Soviets should not ratify the treaty before the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> In a pre-departure interview with a group of foreign reporters, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he still believed a treaty to cut strategic nuclear weapons could be completed during the eight months that remain in his term. But, he said, that would require `` hard work and constructive negotiating by both sides.'' He said his overarching goal was `` to bequeath to my successor next January the firm basis for a stable, sustainable relationship with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.''

 A 16-year-old Jewish seminary student walking through <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s walled old city Thursday was stabbed in the back by an Arab, police said. Authorities said they rounded up 27 suspects. The victim's mother said her son told her the assailant shouted `` <PERSON> Allahu </PERSON> <PERSON> Akhbar </PERSON>!'' -LRB- God is Great -RRB- as he plunged in the knife. In the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, where a Palestinian rebellion began Dec. 8, the army lifted curfews on eight villages and refugee camps. Curfews remained in effect on <LOCATION> Idna </LOCATION> village and the Dheishe refugee camp in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Chanoch </PERSON> <PERSON> Albeck </PERSON> was wearing a black skullcap and was in the old city's Moslem sector when the attack occurred. Two other students helped him to the nearby Jewish quarter, where he was given first aid and taken to a hospital with the knife still in his back. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials said his mother, <PERSON> Plea </PERSON> <PERSON> Albeck </PERSON>, is a government lawyer who has handled cases of land confiscation in the occupied territories, but they said they believed it was a random attack. Mayor <PERSON> Teddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kollek </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> issued a statement saying he was `` shocked and disgusted.'' `` The Arab public in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> must understand that such actions in the end will only hurt Arabs,'' <PERSON> Kollek </PERSON> said. Arab attacks on Jewish civilians have been rare in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, where Jews and Arabs often live side by side, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> in the 1967 war, along with the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, and has formally annexed it. <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> was taken from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in 1967. At least 195 Palestinians have been killed in the Arab rebellion in the occupied territories. An <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier and a Jewish settler also have been slain. According to figures compiled by Law in the Service of Man, a human rights group founded by Palestinian lawyers, 17,000 Arabs have been detained since Dec. 8., and 7,300 remain in jail, 1,800 of them without being tried or charged Most are said to be men aged 15 to 35. The organization, an affiliate of the Geneva-based <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jurists </ORGANIZATION>, said <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers had blown up 36 houses of Arabs suspected of security offenses. <PERSON> Rafi </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON>, spokesman for the <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> police, said <PERSON> Albeck </PERSON> was attacked from behind by a single Arab. He said the student was walking along a narrow lane in the Moslem Quarter, apparently on his way to a seminary in the adjacent Jewish quarter. Dr. <PERSON> Oded </PERSON> <PERSON> Zamir </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Hadassah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> said the knife passed very near the heart but <PERSON> Albeck </PERSON> was was in stable condition. `` Only his lung was injured,'' the doctor said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio. Mrs. <PERSON> Albeck </PERSON> said on the radio her son was conscious and feeling `` relatively good.'' `` He said he heard somebody saying ` <PERSON> Allahu </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON>' and then he felt a push,'' she said. `` Afterwards he ... felt a knife sticking in his back. He called for help and walked but nobody would help him until he reached the Jewish area.'' <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Yosipo </PERSON>, a merchant in the Jewish quarter, told the radio: `` He said he was alone when it happened. ... There apparently was no scuffle.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Albeck </PERSON> said she hoped the stabbing would not increase tensions in the old city. `` During the years we have all lived here and there was progress,'' she said. `` With hope, with God's help, there will be improvement in the future, more understanding.''

<HEAD>Senators Propose Radio-TV Ad Campaign to Combat Drugs</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday introduced a bill to provide $ 75 million annually for a three-year radio and television advertising campaign aimed at reducing demand for illegal drugs. The broadcasting industry branded some provisions of the legislation unconstitutional. The media blitz would have the `` intensity of a presidential advertising campaign,'' said Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, ranking Republican on the panel, who introduced the bill with Sen. <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION>, committee chairman. `` When people turn on their TV in the evening, we want them to see at least once during the evening a commercial that is very hard-hitting about the drug issue,'' <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON> said at a news conference. Under the measure, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> in the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> would oversee production of the ads and buy time to air them on commercial radio and TV stations nationwide. The bill would authorize $ 75 million a year over three years for the program. Broadcasters would be required to provide the government reasonable access to all time periods to air the spots and to charge their lowest rates. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasters </ORGANIZATION> said the bill is unconstitutional because it mandates government access to broadcast facilities. Broadcasters support anti-drug efforts and already contribute more than $ 1 billion a year in air time and facilities to the anti-drug campaign, said <ORGANIZATION> NAB </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fritts </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON> cited precedents for the federal government advertising on radio and TV, including the armed forces' recruiting ads and promotions for <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION>. But the <ORGANIZATION> NAB </ORGANIZATION> said that in none of those cases is a broadcast station required by law to accept an ad. <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON> said an anti-drug ad campaign should be at least as successful as anti-smoking campaigns, which have had to compete against counter-advertising by the tobacco industry and relied mostly on public service announcements. Despite the obstacles, anti-smoking campaigns produced a 25 percent decline in cigarette smoking among Americans over the past two decades, he said.

 An overturned propane tanker burned itself out after two days this morning, enabling hundreds of families to return home and promising some relief from the monumental traffic jams caused by the accident. Fear of an explosion had prompted evacuation of about 500 families within a half-mile of the wreck and the closing of roads and rail lines connecting <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to its eastern suburbs. `` As of 6:28 a.m., the flames extinguished and the tank is empty,'' Officer <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Scibilia </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Nassau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> police spokesman, said today. `` People are being allowed to return to their homes.'' Rail service was restored by the end of the morning rush. County Executive <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Gulotta </PERSON> said the highway would probably reopen in the afternoon. Tens of thousands of commuters had been forced to use alternate rail lines or other transportation after the truck carrying 2,500 gallons of propane burst into flames Tuesday morning on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>'s Seaford-Oyster Bay Expressway. Water had been shot toward the flames from unmanned pumpers for days. Emergency workers watched the slow burn through binoculars from a quarter-mile away. Firefighters avoided trying to extinguish the blaze until the gas was spent in order to avoid an explosion. Firefighters opened a vent on the tanker Wednesday to increase the fire's consumption of the propane. Earlier, Fire Chief <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuhner </PERSON> said that if the `` accelerated burn'' did n't work, the fire could go on for eight days. At a news conference, <PERSON> Gulotta </PERSON> defended the precautions, saying, `` If this tank had exploded it would have devastated everything within a 1,000-foot radius.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rail </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Road </ORGANIZATION> said 30,000 rail commuters were directly affected by the closing of several stations. The truck caught fire about 2,000 feet from the track. The closing of the Seaford-Oyster Bay Expressway and the Sunrise Highway, used by about 70,000 vehicles a day, had forced motorists to go out of their way to get to and from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Pearce </PERSON>, a spokesman for a motorist information service on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, said trips that usually took 45 minutes were taking 3 -LCB- hours. `` I would say the western half of <LOCATION> Nassau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> is backed up solidly,'' he said. `` This is the worst traffic I've seen here in 22 years on the job,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Freeport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Officer <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendricks </PERSON>. Most of the evacuees stayed with relatives or friends. About 300 stayed at the <ORGANIZATION> Seaford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. `` I never thought I'd have to be here a second night. I thought it would be all over with today,'' <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Crinion </PERSON> said late Wednesday. `` If there's a house left when we get home, we're going to be very, very, very happy.''

 Iranian gunboats today attacked a Norwegian-operated oil tanker in the <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION> and set it ablaze. Persian Gulf-based shipping executives identified the stricken tanker as the 15,530-ton liquefied petroleum gas carrier <PERSON> Mundogas </PERSON> <PERSON> Rio </PERSON> and said it was fully laden and sailing out of the Hormuz when attacked. It was the third attack by the Iranians on neutral shipping since <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> broadened the duties of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> in the gulf, allowing warships to intervene in attacks on commercial vessels, even if they were sailing under flags other than the Stars and Stripes. The executives, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they were not aware of any <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships in the area at the time of the attack. They said the captain of the vessel which flies the Liberian flag reported a small fire aboard the vessel, but no casualties among the crew. Two salvage tugboats in the vicinity rushed out to the help the tanker, they said. The attacks are an offshoot of the 7 -LCB- - year-old Iran-Iraq war

<HEAD>Separation Benefits for Railroaders Ruled Fully Taxable</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Separation benefits paid 4,500 employees who lost their jobs with the <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> railroad are fully taxable, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled Thursday. The court held in a test case involving two of the laid-off workers that the benefits are not unemployment compensation, which would have exempted part of them from tax; have not been granted a specific exemption by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and must be fully included in income subject to tax. The benefits were authorized by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> as part of a 1982 law aimed at cutting the expenses of <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION>, which took over seven bankrupt railroads in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. The ruling came in the cases of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> of </PERSON> <PERSON> Girard </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Spanski </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, both of whom were laid off by <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> in 1982 and filed claims for subsistence allowances. <PERSON> Spanski </PERSON> chose an option under which he gave up all seniority rights in exchange for a lump-sum payment of $ 20,000. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> elected a second option, under which he retained his seniority, was listed as furloughed and received a daily subsistence allowance, reimbursement for moving expenses and other benefits, with the package limited to $ 20,000. No money was withheld from either allowance and neither <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Spansky </PERSON> received a W-2 form at yearend listing income received during the year. In May 1984, the two laid-off workers received a notice from the <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retirement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> announcing that the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> had ruled that such benefits, except for health and welfare premiums, were fully taxable. After the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> billed <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Spansky </PERSON> for back taxes on the payments, they challenged the action in <ORGANIZATION> Tax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. The parties agreed that the outcome of their cases would determine those of other laid-off <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> employees.

<HEAD>Financial Woes Reduce PTL Workforce by 66 Percent in Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT MILL, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> laid off 162 employees, shut down its dinner theater and religious music service and cut back on its TV operations this week as time and money continued running out for ministry built by <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>. The layoffs Wednesday were the second such mass dismissal in six weeks. Financial problems have forced <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> to dismiss 66 percent of its work force in the last year. Earlier this week, <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s new trustee, M.C. `` Red'' <PERSON> Benton </PERSON>, said in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> that <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> might have to go off the air and cease all operations within weeks. From last June, when it filed for reorganization under federal bankruptcy law, through the end of April, <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> had piled up $ 3.6 million in operating deficits. It already owed as much as $ 130 million in back debts. Contributions have dropped steadily and dramatically in the last six weeks, since the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> revoked <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s tax-exempt status. Among the operations shut down Wednesday at <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> theme park were, according to spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> West </PERSON>: _ The <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION>'s dinner theater, which drew 77,000 patrons in 1986; _ Park <ORGANIZATION> Road </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Productions </ORGANIZATION>, which produced advertisements and other services for commercial television; _ <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which produced `` This is a major blow,'' said singer <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Stainback </PERSON>. `` There's only four singers left and a rhythm section There were many tears shed this afternoon. It was like another death.'' The biggest cuts Wednesday came on the television side of the ministry, an area that had not been cut seriously in previous layoffs. About 50 of 100 employees lost their jobs, sources told The <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, Observer. `` Today hurt so bad I was n't sure I could go on,'' said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Aldridge </PERSON>, host of `` The <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> Show.'' <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> is for sale, although <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> hopes to salvage its religious functions, including its TV broadcasting, by spinning them off in a separate non-profit entity to be called <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministries </ORGANIZATION>. The ministry built by <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> before his downfall in a sex scandal last year now has 509 full-time employees, compared to 1,480 a year ago.

 <PERSON> Faye </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunaway </PERSON> says her performance as an icy, manipulative <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> in `` Mommie Dearest'' was too believable for her own good, but her portrayal of an alcoholic in `` Barfly'' may have helped save her career. `` I was too good as <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>,'' she said in an interview published in the June 13 issue of <LOCATION> US </LOCATION> magazine. `` I think that changed the notion of who I was. ... It created a kind of monstrous element which I do n't think had been part of my life before.'' In `` Barfly,'' she said, she was able to show the results of analysis in which she `` learned to relax as a person.'' `` I'm more accepting of my vulnerability now,'' she said. `` I've always had enormous insecurity, but I was always frightened of showing that before, so I sort of hid behind whatever kind of facade I could. In her newest film, `` Midnight Cruising,'' Ms. <PERSON> Dunaway </PERSON> plays an ophthalmologist blinded by glaucoma, which required her to learn what sightlessness is like. `` Hearing became very important,'' she said. `` She -LRB- her character -RRB- was always seeing with her ears. ...

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two white policemen were sentenced Thursday to hang for the murder of a young black man who was beaten and then shot through the head after drunken officers went on a `` black-bashing expedition.'' They are the first white policemen in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to face execution for crimes committed while on duty in a black township. Only six whites ever have been hanged here for killing blacks. The pivotal testimony against Warrant Officer <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Villiers </PERSON>, 37, and Constable <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Goosen </PERSON>, 27, came from other members of their 10-man riot unit who abandoned a cover-up attempt after being pressured by investigators. Several officers testified that <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Villiers </PERSON>, the unit leader, ordered <PERSON> Goosen </PERSON> to `` take out'' <PERSON> Mlungisi </PERSON> <PERSON> Stuurman </PERSON> because the youth had been beaten too severely to be set free. <PERSON> Stuurman </PERSON>, 18, was led to a river bank and shot in the back of the head on July 26, 1986, in the black section of <LOCATION> Cradock </LOCATION>, in eastern <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Province </LOCATION>. The non-jury trial took place in the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Grahamstown </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Cradock </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Goosen </PERSON> and <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Villiers </PERSON> stood impassively as the sentence was read. Their wives and some court employees broke into tears. Their lawyer expressed his clients' regret for <PERSON> Stuurman </PERSON>'s death, and the officers were embraced by relatives and fellow policemen before being led away. There was no date set for the execution. Justice N.W. <PERSON> Zietsman </PERSON> convicted the two men Wednesday, agreeing with prosecutors that <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Villiers </PERSON> had led his unit on a `` black-bashing expedition'' in which residents were assaulted indiscriminately. On Thursday, <PERSON> Zietsman </PERSON> rejected the mitigation arguments presented by the defense and also refused to grant permission for the defendants to appeal the sentence. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Villiers </PERSON>' lawyer, <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Jansen </PERSON>, had said his client was of below average intelligence and was drunk at the time of the shooting. <PERSON> Jansen </PERSON> said the defendants deserved sympathy because they had been living with `` a sword over their heads'' for two years. <PERSON> Goosen </PERSON> testified that he suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder because of repeated exposure to violence in black townships. He also said he had an unhappy childhood during which he was taunted because of his dark complexion. According to testimony during the trial, members of <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Villiers </PERSON>' squad drank heavily, conducted a blood-oath ceremony swearing themselves to secrecy, then entered the township at about 3 a.m. and assaulted several blacks Following another bout of drinking at their base, the squad returned to the township after daybreak. <PERSON> Stuurman </PERSON>, who was wearing a T-shirt bearing the slogan `` Forward To <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION>,'' was chased and grabbed by officers when he tried to walk away from them, then was assaulted, several officers testified. The officers said <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Villiers </PERSON> ordered that <PERSON> Stuurman </PERSON> should be `` taken out'' because of the severity of his injuries. The defendants contended that the shooting was an accident. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Villiers </PERSON> said he did not report the incident immediately because he was still under the influence of alcohol. <PERSON> Stuurman </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON>, and his 21-year-old brother, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON>, said in interviews last week in <LOCATION> Cradock </LOCATION> that they could not forgive the policemen. They were not in court this week. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Stuurman </PERSON>, who was present in 1986 when the officers grabbed his brother from their yard and forced him into a van, recalled testifying against de Villiers and <PERSON> Goosen </PERSON>. `` I can still remember their faces very clearly, and when I had to give evidence in court and I saw them again, I felt dizzy and had to be taken outside.'' `` <PERSON> Mlungisi </PERSON> was a good boy,'' said <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Stuurman </PERSON>, 63. `` Even while I am sitting here, I can see his face.''

<HEAD>New Warning to Japan in Feud Over Beef Import Curbs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> must quickly reach agreement on lowering import barriers to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> beef or face retaliatory action, a <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> senator said Thursday. `` <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has been saying for weeks that they'll come up with an agreement, but it has not come home with the bacon,'' Sen. <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Baucus </PERSON>, D-Mont., told a news conference also attended by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> Unless <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> moves swiftly to drop barriers to beef imports the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is likely to begin steps that could lead to retaliation, <PERSON> Baucus </PERSON> said. An agreement under which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> accepted Japanese quotas on its exports of beef expired March 31. Since then, the countries have been deadlocked on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> demands for an end to the curbs and no increase in tariffs. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> already represents the largest export market for American beef. In 1986, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> beef exporters sold $ 500 million worth of the product to the Japanese. The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> estimates, however, that sales could be expanded dramatically if <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> would eliminate its quota system that limits imports of restaurant grade beef, for example, to 58,400 tons. <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> says exports might increase to $ 2 billion without the restrictions. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said it was `` just imperative that the government of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the people of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> commit themselves to true market liberalization.'' He said the system of restrictions was `` not mildly protectionist, it is blatantly protectionist.'' Sen. <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallop </PERSON>, R-Wyo., who like <PERSON> Baucus </PERSON> is a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on international trade, reiterated that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was `` not asking for a guaranteed market. `` We've never asked for a guaranteed market,'' <PERSON> Wallop </PERSON> said. `` We're asking for guaranteed access to that market.'' He emphasized that Japanese beef prices are far above those in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> because of the restrictions. `` They are cheating their own consumers,'' <PERSON> Wallop </PERSON> said. `` They are actually stealing from their own consumers.'' The massive trade bill that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> recently passed contains a non-binding provision expressing the sense of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> that the Japanese should drop their barriers to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> beef and citrus imports.

No weapons were seen among the people who occupied the embassy in the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> capital. There were no known threats to harm anyone or do any damage. The protesters demanded to talk with Attorney General <PERSON> Horacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Serpa </PERSON> and the managers of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>'s departments of electric power and water. The Mexican ambassador, <PERSON> Rudolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Figueroa </PERSON>, was not at the embassy when the activists rushed into the embassy at 9 a.m., the embassy's press officer, <PERSON> Constantino </PERSON> <PERSON> Morales </PERSON>, said in a telephone interview from the embassy with the radio chain <ORGANIZATION> Caracol </ORGANIZATION> Three embassy officials and an undetermined number of Colombian employees were in the embassy when the protesters arrived, <PERSON> Morales </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Morales </PERSON> said the three officials were himself, political adviser <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> and the consul, <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> <PERSON> Savedra </PERSON>. The protesters had hired a bus, the bus driver, <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> <PERSON> Conti </PERSON>, said in an interview with the <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> radio station <ORGANIZATION> RCN </ORGANIZATION>. As the bus approached the <ORGANIZATION> Mexican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, the people on the bus pulled on black hoods, <PERSON> Conti </PERSON> said. Two Colombian policemen guarding the embassy, following standing <ORGANIZATION> Mexican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> instructions about such takeovers, did not try to use their pistols. The intruders said they were members of the April 19 Movement. The military wing of the April 19 Movement, known as M-19, seized the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>'s embassy and held 16 ambassadors hostage there for two months in 1980. The M-19 also stormed the government's <ORGANIZATION> Palace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> in 1986. Ninety-five people, including 11 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> justices, were killed. This is the third time in four years the <ORGANIZATION> Mexican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> has been occupied by people with grievances against the government. The previous occupations, by university students, were peaceful. Many of the poorest areas of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, in the south, have had water and electricity rationed for two months as the capital goes through its worst drought in 53 years. The middle-class and upper-class homes in the northern part of the capital have not been affected.

<HEAD>Six More Bodies Recovered From Golden Temple</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AMRITSAR, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Municipal workers recovered six more decomposed bodies and human bones from the Golden Temple complex Thursday, and a police officer said as many as 15 more corpses could be buried around the shrine. Two human skeletons, one male and the other female, were recovered by the workers from the complex on Wednesday. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Ramaswamy </PERSON> <PERSON> Venkataraman </PERSON> promulgated an ordinance to prevent religious institutions from being used by radicals and political parties. The ordinance bans the use of religious places for campaigns against the state and calls for five years of hard labor for violators, government officials said. The Golden Temple is the Sikhs' holiest shrine. Militant Sikhs have been fighting for a separate state in the northern <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> region, where they form a majority. The workers in <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION> on Thursday were joined by relatives of people missing and feared killed by extremists in the temple. <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION> Police Superintendent <PERSON> Baldev </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> said the remains were `` people tortured and then killed by Sikh terrorists'' and said a search was under way for more. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> said the bodies recovered Thursday were of two females and six males. `` We are getting lots of human bones and some skulls. It is a terrible job down here,'' <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. The workers were seen removing two bagfuls of human bones recovered from the debris. Sikh extremists had turned the <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> into an armed camp. The radicals were forced out during a police siege of the shrine earlier this month. The siege, from May 9 to 18, resulted in the surrender of more than 200 extremists and sympathizers. At least 46 people, most of them Sikh radicals, were killed during the siege. Three other radicals committed suicide by swallowing cyanide rather than face arrest. There had been frequent reports that people were being detained and tortured by militants inside the shrine. Several people were reported missing by families after they went to the temple to pray. The Sikh religion was formed about 500 years ago as an alternative to <LOCATION> Hinduism </LOCATION> and Islam. Sikhs, who make up less than 2 percent of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 800 million population, claim they are discriminated against by the majority Hindus. More than 1,150 people have been killed by Sikh extremists in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> state since the start of the year. In 1987, 1,030 people were killed. Indian security forces raided the <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> in 1984, killing 1,200 people, mostly Sikhs. Prime Minister <PERSON> Indira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> ordered the raid. Two of Mrs. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s Sikh guards assassinated her five months later.

<TEXT>
 A former <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> official indicted in the disappearance of some $ 186,000 is believed to have fled the country, authorities say. County Attorney <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> announced Wednesday that a grand jury had returned indictments against <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> Darville </PERSON>, who was fired last month by the university's Office of Minority and Special Student Affairs. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said authorities believe he is in the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>. `` We will immediately begin pursuing a federal warrant for unlawful flight,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. `` He is from the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>, he has family there.'' If <PERSON> Darville </PERSON> is found in the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>, extradition could be a lengthy process, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Darville </PERSON> was fired after a university audit showed $ 186,000 missing from the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minority </ORGANIZATION> and Special Student Affairs since 1983. <PERSON> Darville </PERSON> told auditors he had given money to 17 minority students, including nine football players. Evidence shows <PERSON> Darville </PERSON> used some of the money himself, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. He said he did n't know how much of the money was spent on athletes or other students. One former student athlete, <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Baylor </PERSON>, told the <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Darville </PERSON> gave him about $ 5,000 in cash over a six-year period. He said the money was handed to him in envelopes. <LOCATION> Baylor </LOCATION>, 24, who played football for the university from 1982 to 1985, said he received money on `` several occasions'' and used it to fly home to <LOCATION> Harrisburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, to pay rent and to buy food. Asked if he thought the arrangement might be illegal, <ORGANIZATION> Baylor </ORGANIZATION> said: `` At that time, it did n't even matter to me ... as long as it was understood that I did n't have to pay any of the money back. `` If they keep pursuing it, there's going to be a lot more information about the athletic department,'' <ORGANIZATION> Baylor </ORGANIZATION> went on. `` Some of the fellows might be willing to speak out later on, if they get angry, and tell the real story. It stems deeper than <PERSON> Darville </PERSON> giving out money.'' He declined to elaborate. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Collegiate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Athletic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> rules prohibit `` the award of financial aid to a student-athlete that exceeds commonly accepted educational expenses -LRB- i.e., tuition and fees, room and board, and required course-related books -RRB-, other than legitimate loans, based upon a regular repayment schedule, available to all students and administered on the same basis for all students.'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawton </PERSON>, <PERSON> Darville </PERSON>'s attorney, has said <PERSON> Darville </PERSON> broke no laws and said he had never denied that <PERSON> Darville </PERSON> had assisted athletes. University attorney <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Donohue </PERSON> said the school was uncertain whether <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION> rules had been violated. <PERSON> Donohue </PERSON> said the county attorney had requested that the university hold off investigating possible violations. <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION> officials said they had no comment on the case.

 Appealing for an increase in foreign aid, Deputy Secretary of State <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> told senators Thursday that other countries increasingly see <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military bases as a liability rather than an asset. `` This is a disturbing situation,'' he said. <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> mentioned <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, in all of which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is negotiating on the future of its bases. The House on Wednesday approved a bill to provide $ 14.3 billion in aid for the fiscal year beginning Sept. 30. The final amount will depend on agreement between the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The administration is asking for a 3.7 percent increase in military aid, with all equipment being transferred for the first time as grants rather than loans. `` Loans only add to our allies' burden of debt, which may not be repaid anyway,'' <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> said. He was testifying before the foreign operations subcommittee of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> said an overall aid increase of 2 percent over this year's level is needed to restore funds for key programs in <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> which either got no money this year or were drastically cut. `` We can not expect others to be dependable friends if we can not be one ourselves,'' he said. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON>, undersecretary of state for security assistance, said there is no debate about the need of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> for aid. `` As a newly restored democracy, an ally, and a country facing a dangerous communist insurgency, the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> is looking for significantly higher assistance levels from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, its principal security partner,'' he said. Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, in charge of foreign aid at the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, called the request of $ 110 million for the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> a reasonable amount, saying that it was $ 15 million less than <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> earmarked for this year. `` In addition, the amount of assistance that the Philippine armed forces can optimally absorb this year is limited,'' he said. `` The <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> requires a great deal of assistance to resolve its security problems, but it should be applied in the context of an efficient and reliable long-term program.'' <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> questioned whether $ 45 million asked for <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> will be enough as five million Afghan refugees in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> seek to return to their homes following the withdrawal of Soviet troops.

 Black South African guerrilla leaders and white opponents of apartheid sharply disagreed Thursday over the use of violence to attain their common goal, but they pledged to hold further talks. Four representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> met in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> with eight members of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>. The meeting occurred the same day as two bomb blasts in <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>. Four people were injured in the blasts, which <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s justice minister blamed on the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> The <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> is the largest guerrilla group fighting <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s white-led government. <PERSON> Wynand </PERSON> <PERSON> Malan </PERSON>, a member of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and the leader of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> delegation, was asked if the two sides had discussed violence carried out by the guerrillas to promote their goals. `` We voiced not only our position, but our difference to that strategy,'' <PERSON> Malan </PERSON> told reporters after the meeting. `` We also got an explanation from them again as to the origin of the armed struggle. We can understand from their perspective exactly what they are saying, but from our position we are still fundamentally in disagreement to it,'' <PERSON> Malan </PERSON> said. The guerrilla group, based in <LOCATION> Lusaka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>, wages a bombing and sabotage campaign in its bid to oust <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s government. By law and custom, South African apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services. In a joint statement after Thursday's meeting, the two groups said: `` Common ground was found in relation to the kind of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> we would like to see. However, there were important differences with respect to some aspects of the strategy through which this could be achieved.'' Also attending the press conference was <PERSON> Thabo </PERSON> <PERSON> Mbeki </PERSON>, spokesman for the guerrilla group in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. He defended use of force by the group, which was outlawed by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in 1960. `` That left us no choice but to take up arms. If those conditions were to change, then of course the issue of whether to continue or not continue the armed struggle would be reconsidered,'' <PERSON> Mbeki </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Malan </PERSON> earlier defended the decision to meet the four executive committee members of the guerrilla organization. `` This is a normal further discussion with the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>, seeking a common ground and strategies out of the impasse,'' in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, he told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> at an interview in a <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> hotel. `` It's the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>'s policy to meet with all political groupings,'' said <PERSON> Malan </PERSON>. He said the goal of the meeting was to seek `` common ground'' with the black resistance movement. <PERSON> Malan </PERSON> said <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> was chosen as the meeting site because `` it was the quickest access to a mutually convenient venue.'' The two sides at the <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> meeting agreed to hold more talks, though no date was given.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Alcee </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> was a target of an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> bribery conspiracy investigation from its very beginning, a congressional panel conducting impeachment proceedings against the jurist was told Thursday. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Agent <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who directed the investigation, said an informant, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Dredge </PERSON>, told the agency that <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> A </PERSON>. Borders, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lawyer and close friend of <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>, had bragged that he could bribe several judges, including <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> had an undercover agent meet with Borders in the fall of 1981 to discuss the possibility of bribing <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>, who was then hearing a case involving two convicted racketeers, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Romano </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. `` We were only trying to prove or disprove what -LRB- Dredge -RRB- said,'' <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on criminal justice. Later, he said, the undercover agent met with Borders and gave him $ 120,000 as a partial payment to <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> in return for a lenient sentence to the <PERSON> Romanos </PERSON> and a return of a major portion of seized assets. Borders was arrested after the money changed hands. He was convicted in 1982 of arranging a $ 150,000 bribe for <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>, was sentenced to five years in prison and was fined $ 35,000. He served 33 months in the <LOCATION> Allenwood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, federal prison and 27 months on parole and was subsequently disbarred by the <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> was acquitted of bribery conspiracy charges. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> `` was a target from the outset. His name was mentioned by Borders. We tried to prove or disprove the allegation and it turned out to be true.''

<HEAD>State to Pay Nursery Owner $2.6 Million</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A nursery owner has been awarded $ 2.6 million for 510,000 citrus trees the state destroyed in 1985 in a program to control what was thought to be an incurable, fast-spreading citrus canker. A judge and six-member jury decided Wednesday the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> had to pay <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Polk </PERSON> for burning his stock as part of a statewide program that destroyed millions of trees. <LOCATION> Polk </LOCATION> had asked for $ 3 milllion in his suit. In a precedent-setting case in January, Circuit Judge <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Strickland </PERSON> ruled the <ORGANIZATION> agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> department </ORGANIZATION> unnecessarily destroyed <LOCATION> Polk </LOCATION>'s stock after scientists testified that canker had been misdiagnosed and there was never a real threat to the industry. `` It's a relief,'' said <LOCATION> Polk </LOCATION>. `` That's all an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizen can ask for is a fair day in court.'' Attorney <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> <PERSON> Connor </PERSON>, co-counsel for <LOCATION> Polk </LOCATION>, said he hoped the case might influence the state to settle other cases he plans to file for affected nursery owners. The state, however, said it would appeal the award. It's also appealing a $ 1.9 million award earlier this year to two <LOCATION> Hardee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> nursery owners.

 A House panel on Thursday approved a bill to limit the amount of advertising that may be shown during children's television programs The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> voted 39-3 to send the measure to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor, where it is expected to win approval.

The bill passed by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee would limit TV stations to no more than 10 -LCB- minutes of commercials per hour during children's shows on weekends and 12 minutes per hour during these programs on weekdays. It also would require the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to consider, when deciding whether to renew a station's license, whether the station complied with the advertising limits and served the educational needs of children in its overall programming. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasters </ORGANIZATION>, which has said it will not oppose the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> measure, says no stations would have difficulty meeting the limits in the legislation.

<TEXT>
 Corporations' after-tax profits edged up 0.5 percent in the first three months of the year, a much smaller increase than in the last quarter of 1987, the government said Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said after-tax profits rose to an annual rate of $ 146.4 billion, following a gain of 2.6 percent in the previous quarter. Manufacturing profits were up in the first quarter, with the chemical industry enjoying the largest increases. Profits in the transportation and utilities industries were down, while those in financial industries showed a tiny gain. Analysts said the slowdown in profits showed that companies were beginning to see some pressures from rising wages and higher costs for component parts, especially if those parts are imported. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, senior economist with <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said that faced with rising demand, companies are likely to begin boosting their prices in order to regain lost profit margins. `` Because of the squeeze on profits, there will be an incentive on firms to raise their prices,'' he said, and these increases will add to growing inflationary pressures. Among the details in the profits report: _ Before-tax profits fell 1.8 percent in the first quarter, to an annual level of $ 280.6 billion, after rising 0.2 percent in the fourth quarter _ Corporate profits, after adjusting for depreciation and inventories, fell 1 percent to $ 309.9 billion, the second consecutive quarterly decline _ Corporate cash flows, a measurement intended to show the funds corporations have for investment, rose 1.2 percent to an annual rate of $ 381 billion after a 0.5 percent rise in the fourth quarter _ Dividend payments to stockholders rose 2.1 percent in the first quarter to an annual rate of $ 99.3 billion following a 2.2 percent rise in the fourth quarter

<TEXT>
 Religious education will mean more than having a parochial school building in the parish, as <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> educators are charting a future that emphasizes adult education and teaching children outside the traditional setting. Faced with continued enrollment declines, educators moved toward a broader definition of <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> education during a weeklong symposium on their future course. The concerns of those working with adults and with <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> children attending public schools dominated discussions, while little talk was devoted to stopping the enrollment erosion at parochial schools. The 300 participants in the Catholic Education Futures Project left unfinished the work of writing a `` vision statement.'' But they developed a list of priorities. Sister <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, an organizer, said the list reflected a strong belief that <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> education must embrace `` radical aspects of the gospel, including education for peace and justice, respect for all cultures'' and elimination of racism and sexism. Twenty-two organizations sent representatives to the symposium at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dayton </ORGANIZATION>, organized by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> dioceses have lost 3 million students and 4,200 schools since 1965. Last year, 110 more schools closed their doors, and enrollment fell by 103,000 to 2.6 million in the 8,992 remaining schools. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> has more than 48 million members, making it the largest single body of Christians in the nation. By the new, broader definition, `` Catholic education is not getting smaller, it's getting larger,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON>, secretary of education for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>. `` We're not going out of business.'' Sister <PERSON> Georgette </PERSON> <PERSON> Zalewska </PERSON>, director of adult and religious education for the <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, diocese, said the church needs to move beyond `` that school mentality'' and find new ways to educate senior citizens, adolescents and adults. But Sister <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Bauch </PERSON>, an education professor at the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> who has studied largely black parochial schools in inner cities, said the conference ignored the needs of parents and other <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> school `` consumers.'' `` The church has come to see it is very expensive to operate schools and therefore is looking for other ways to educate people,'' <PERSON> Bauch </PERSON> said. Historically, the public school child who attended weekly religion classes `` was considered a second-class citizen,'' said <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Malone </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Youngstown </LOCATION>. But archdioceses around the country are hiring paid, full-time directors of religious education, like <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Kayser </PERSON>, a laywoman who runs the programs for <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Thomas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Parish </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Crystal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION> `` When the topic of <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> education comes up, there's too much emphasis in thinking it means only schools,'' said <PERSON> Kayser </PERSON>, who has 650 students in her programs. The Rev. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON>, pastor of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> James </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bridgeport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, said he is trying to rename the parish school the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> James </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Religious </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Formation </ORGANIZATION> to stress prayer classes, scripture study and other educational activities. But he said his parishioners `` get nervous'' about such a change. Catholic schools must emphasize the teaching of faith `` just as much as geography, math or anything else,'' said <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON>. He said he sees no reason to operate a parochial school that `` smells like and looks like the public school except for maybe a course in religion and an amorphous Catholic environment.'' Bishop <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Schulte </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, who heads the bishops' committee on education, said, `` There's no adequate substitute for the full-curriculum <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> school. But he acknowledged that `` very substantial areas'' exist where Catholic parents simply do n't have a parochial school available. Parochial schools flourished in big cities with immigrants from <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> lands like <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. `` In early times we saw ourselves in kind of a fortress mentality to the white Protestant culture that was here,'' said <PERSON> Brother </PERSON> <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitz </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dayton </ORGANIZATION>. When <PERSON> Catholics </PERSON> became more affluent and moved to the suburbs, churches followed, but schools did not.

 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposed on Thursday that companies lacking `` drug-free programs'' be denied government contracts. He also called for creation of an international strike force to find and destroy drug crops. A <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spokesman said the first proposal might include some form of mandatory drug testing. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in what aides described as a major anti-drug initiative, said, `` I will make adoption of drug-free programs a condition of obtaining federal contracts and I will ask the states to do the same.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> outlined his drug plan, an expansion of previous anti-drug proposals, at a <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> breakfast in nearby <LOCATION> Secaucus </LOCATION>, then underscored his proposals with a visit to a drug rehabilitation center here, where he talked with patients who had been drug addicts. Later, he was flying to his vacation retreat in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, where he will spend a week on strategy and meetings with <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> leaders and advisers. On the drug issue, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that an international strike force, possibly under the auspices of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, could `` wipe out crops wherever they are grown and take out drug labs wherever they exist.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> involement would be coordinated by a military officer reporting to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s vice president. `` Our military forces have already made a substantial contribution to our interdiction effort and today they're being called upon to do more. Their primary target should be the production of drugs abroad,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also reiterated an earlier call for a <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION> drug summit and said he would put his vice president in charge of anti-drug efforts. On another topic, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also renewed his call for a federal special prosecutor to investigate the finances of <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. Speaking to an Italian-American group at lunch, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` We hear a lot of flak from the Democrats on current ethical problems in the administration,'' an apparent reference to the legal investigation of Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. `` I wonder if <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> will join me in calling for the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> to appoint a special prosecutor to look into its own troubles, starting with the speaker,'' he said. The private lobbying group <ORGANIZATION> Common </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cause </ORGANIZATION> had earlier called for an investigation, and Rep. <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, R-Ga., filed a formal complaint about <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> with the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee Thursday <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>'s complaint, accompanied by a supporting letter signed by 71 <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Republicans, asked for an investigation in four areas, including published reports that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> received unusually high book royalities from a printing company that did business with his campaign committee. In <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also told the Italian-American audience that, while <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> should be proud of his Greek-American ancestry, `` he's not going to be the champion of ethnic <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. I'm going to be the champion of ethnic <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s comments on private companies and drugs marked the first time he had sought to tie the war against drugs to government contracts. His chief of staff, <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>, told reporters that the thrust of the proposal was `` the vice president's notion that employers should do everything possible to get drugs out of the workplace.'' `` We did n't come today to write the regulations,'' <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> said. However, he said it was `` conceivable that testing of some kind could be part of it.'' <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> said that the vice president saw `` a lot of merit to random drug testing'' for government contractors. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has already proposed mandatory testing for airline pilots, prison guards and others who hold safety-related jobs. On still another subject, <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> denied that the decision of <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Teeley </PERSON> to step down as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign communications director reflected dissension. Campaign aides said on Wednesday that <PERSON> Teeley </PERSON>, a longtime adviser to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, would be reassigned to work on political issues. No reason was given for the change. <PERSON> Teeley </PERSON> has been known to be at odds recently with <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>. However, <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> said, `` I do n't think there was a rift. There was n't a resignation.''

<HEAD>Former Hostages, Relatives Said to Join in Hamadi Trial</HEAD>

 A court official said Thursday that six Americans who were aboard a <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> jet commandeered in 1985 and relatives of a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver killed in the ordeal will help prosecute one of the suspected hijackers. <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> goes on trial July 5 in a specially-built, $ 7.5 million courtroom on charges of air piracy and murder in the hijacking. The Americans' legal intervention allows their attorneys to ask questions during court sessions. During a tour to show reporters the courtroom inside <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>'s Preungesheim prison, court spokesman <PERSON> Falk </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said eight Americans _ including six people who were on the hijacked jetliner _ had formally intervened in the `` Six are former hostages. The other two are relatives of <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>, I believe the parents,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> told reporters. He declined to provide the names. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> was shot to death during the hijacking. His parents, who live in <LOCATION> Waldorf </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, could not be immediately reached for comment. The practice of legal intervention, common in the German system, is sometimes called acting as a `` private prosecutor.'' It is designed to ensure that victims' interests are properly represented in criminal trials. It also gives the intervenors the right of appeal to a higher court. They are not required to be present in the courtroom. However, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> indicated that at least some of the Americans would be here. During to tour, the court spokesman said, `` Some of those people who are coming as witnesses or intervenors in the prosecution could feel threatened, and we do n't want that to happen.'' Four armed men hijacked the plane on June 14, 1985, on a flight from <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, and forced it to land in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Thirty-nine Americans were held captive for 17 days. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government officials have indicted <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, but <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> refused to extradite him. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> is in a <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> prison awaiting trial. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> judge acting as spokesman for the <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> trial, said that the construction costs of the courtroom came to $ 7.5 million. Seats for 100 journalists and 80 members of the public are separated from the judges, witnesses and defendant by huge plates of bulletproof glass. The spectators will listen through a loudspeaker system. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said the trial will start July 5 with reading of the indictment and a chance for <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> to make a statement. A juvenile court then will decide whether <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> was under 21 years old when the hijacking preparations started. If it rules he was 21 or younger, then <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> would be subject to a maximum of 15 years in prison. If the court tries him as an adult, <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> could receive life in prison. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> has told West German authorities he was born on June 13, 1964, but he later said he was younger. West German and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials believe he is 23 years old. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s 29-year-old brother, <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, was sentenced by a <LOCATION> Duesseldorf </LOCATION> court to 13 years in prison for kidnapping two West Germans in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in a failed attempt to gain freedom for his younger brother.

<HEAD>Authorities Unusually Tolerant At Pre-Summit Jewish Demonstration</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Authorities allowed an unusually large demonstration Thursday by Soviet Jews who have been denied permission to emigrate and who urged President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to take up their cause at the superpower summit. Despite the tolerance of the protest, a <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> refusenik, the term for Jews refused permission to leave the country, said the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> secret police has warned him against accepting an invitation to meet <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Monday. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> plans to meet Monday afternoon at <ORGANIZATION> Spaso </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador's residence, with the activists and refuseniks to underscore his concern for human rights problems. The Soviet government has not objected to the meeting. On Thursday, Soviet officials holding a news conference on the summit said who the president meets with is his business. `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> president, who will be our guest in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, is certainly free to decide who of Soviet citizens he finds interesting and useful to meet with outside the framework of the official events,'' said Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrovsky </PERSON> said. But, he added, `` This American move is hardly aimed at improving mutual understanding between the <LOCATION> U.S.A. </LOCATION> and U.S.S.R.'' Dozens of uniformed and plainclothes policemen shouted at the demonstrators to disperse and ripped down some of the protester's posters during the 1 -LCB- - hour protest within sight of the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will meet starting But unlike past protests, the officers did not arrest or detain any of the demonstrators, gathered outside the <ORGANIZATION> Lenin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION> as Western journalists watched. One uniformed militiaman, asked why the demonstrators were not hauled away, responded in one word: `` Perestroika.'' That is <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of restructuring Soviet society, including some greater tolerance of dissent and somewhat freer emigration. `` A World Without Missiles or Refuseniks,'' proclaimed one large banner, made of wallpaper. `` We Welcome the Summit,'' read another poster, which plainclothes <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> officers ripped from the hands of 30-year-old <PERSON> Marina </PERSON> <PERSON> Durnovo </PERSON>. <PERSON> Roald </PERSON> `` <PERSON> Alec </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Zelichonok </PERSON>, who has been refused permission to emigrate for more than 10 years, said he received a letter and telephone call Tuesday from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> inviting him to take part in Monday's meeting with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. Shortly after the embassy phone call, he said, a <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> officer telephoned. `` This officer called and said in light of security measures around <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, my departure for <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> will not be permitted,'' <PERSON> Zelichonok </PERSON> said by telephone from his <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> home. <PERSON> Zelichonok </PERSON>, 51, said the officer warned him that if he traveled to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, `` administrative measures'' carrying possible penalties of detention, house arrest or up to 15 days in jail would be taken against him. He said he thought the warning may have been prompted by his plan to present <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> a book he and another refusenik wrote about 18 would-be emigres who died awaiting permission to leave the country. <PERSON> Zelichonok </PERSON> said he intends to attend the meeting with his wife despite the warning. Soviet authorities have cleared the capital of `` undesirables'' during previous international events, such as the 1980 Summer Olympics. The demonstrators said they want human rights to figure prominently in the Reagan-Gorbachev meetings. `` We very much hope that the summit brings success in the area of freedom of emigration,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Durnovo </PERSON>. `` America is our hope, our support, the only country the opposes our country.'' Asked why she wanted to leave the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and settle in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, Ms. <PERSON> Durnovo </PERSON> replied: `` It's impossible to live in this country. I wo n't be alive by the time there are results of perestroika,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Durnovo </PERSON>, a 30-year-old <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Jew who applied to emigrate about six months ago. She said she had not been denied permission to leave yet, but that `` there's never a guarantee.'' Many of the protesters were from <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>, although demonstrators said about 15 of them who tried to travel to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> were taken off a train bound for the capital by <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> officers. Other protesters came from the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Moldavia </LOCATION>. The U.S.-based National Conference on Soviet Jewry reported last week that 1,086 Jews were allowed to leave the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in April, the highest monthly total in nearly seven years. The figure has been rising for about a year, but it falls far short of the 1979 levels, when the monthly average was about 4,000 departures.

<HEAD>State Will Tear Down Shoreham Nuclear Power Plant</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto NY15</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> nuclear power plant, long a burden to <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lighting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, will be taken over by the state and torn down under an agreement reached Thursday by state officials and the utility. If the agreement, which is subject to many conditions, goes through, it would be the first time a completed nuclear power plant was abandoned before it opened. The deal calling for <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION> to sell the $ 5.3 billion plant to the state for $ 1 was a victory for opponents of the facility 55 miles east of <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> on the north shore of <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. At a news conference Thursday, Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said the plant should be torn down, rather than mothballed, to prevent its resurrection. `` That would be very much like taking a loaded rifle and storing it in the closet,'' said <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>. `` Maybe someday that <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- will take over and then we can use it.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Hochbrueckner </PERSON>, whose district includes the plant, agreed. `` We've shown Shoreham the cross, but we have to put a stake through its heart,'' he said. While <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said a few details remain to be worked out, he insisted, `` We have gotten everything we wanted.'' `` <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> has to die, <PERSON> Shoreham </PERSON> will die,'' he said. The Shoreham project, begun in 1965, ended up 10 years behind schedule and more than 80 times as expensive as originally predicted, driving <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION> to the edge of bankruptcy. Completed in 1984, it never went into service because of the refusal by state and local officials to participate in emergency evacuation planning. They argued that <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, because of its geography, could not be safely evacuated during a nuclear accident. The densely populated, narrow island, with about 2.5 million residents outside of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, extends eastward about 120 miles from <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. In the event of an evacuation, residents would have to leave either by boat or head westward. Without such a plan, the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> refused to issue anything more than a low-power testing license for <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION>. State efforts to close <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> accelerated after the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> in October eliminated the rule requiring state and local government participation in an evacuation plan. The state had been proceeding with a possible takeover of the company, and <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> had set a midnight Wednesday deadline for the conclusion of negotiations. The announcement of a tentative agreement between the state and <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION> came about 1 -LCB- hours after that deadline. For <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION>, the settlement would allow it to continue to operate as a privately owned utility. The entire agreement must be approved by the state <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, and some parts of it need the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>'s approval New generating plants would then be built on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> to ensure an adequate supply of electricity. The deal also is subject to <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION> being able to obtain an investment rating that will allow it to refinance $ 2 billion of its debt at lower interest rates. And any decommissioning plan would be subject to <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> approval, said agency spokesman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Ingram </PERSON>. While that could give the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> the ability to block the dismantling, <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Fryer </PERSON> said he felt the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> would consider only safety issues in ruling on plans to raze the plant. Under the tentative agreement, <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION> would pay for decommissioning, which could cost $ 500 million, said <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> aides. But the utility would be allowed to raise its electric rates by 5 percent annually for the next three years, and rate increases of 5 percent annually would be the target for the following seven years. <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION>'s nearly 1 million customers pay the second-highest electric rates in the country, second only to neighboring <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> area. The governor said the agreement, if finalized, would have no negative impact on rates for customers of other utilities in the state. The settlement calls for action by the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on the rate structure issue within 90 days of the proposal's filing with it, expected in a few days. During the 90-day period, <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION> agreed not to turn up the power at <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> even in the unlikely event that it obtained the 25 percent power operating license it had been seeking from the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> has called <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION>'s management `` arrogant and cynical,'' and insisted on company reforms. But he said Thursday that <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION> and the state had yet to work out exactly what they would be. He said it might be good if <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Catacosinos </PERSON> remained `` for the time being.'' In addition to the tentative settlement with the state, <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION> is also trying to negotiate an end to a $ 8.7 billion racketeering case filed against the utility by <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> officials and individual homeowners.

 Authorities filed charges of passport violations Thursday against a man they suspect is one of nine <ORGANIZATION> Japanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> terrorists who hijacked a Japanese airliner to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> in 1970, when he was only 16. <PERSON> Hideo </PERSON> <PERSON> Marutani </PERSON> of the district prosecutor's office in <LOCATION> Kobe </LOCATION>, western <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Yasuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Shibata </PERSON>, 34, would be turned over to <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> police `` in the next couple of days'' for investigation on possible hijacking and related charges. Investigators from <LOCATION> Kobe </LOCATION>, who arrested <PERSON> Shibata </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> on May 6, said he obtained the passport in <LOCATION> Yokohama </LOCATION> in July 1986 using the name of a <LOCATION> Kobe </LOCATION> man with dual Japanese and North Korean citizenship. The man had returned to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> in 1972 without disclaiming Japanese citizenship, they said. <PERSON> Marutani </PERSON>, interviewed by telephone, gave no further details. He said <PERSON> Shibata </PERSON> could be sentenced to three years in prison if convicted on the passport charges. A convicted hijacker not charged with murder in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is subject to a maximum term of life in prison, the prosecutor said. Hijackers seized the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727, which had 138 people aboard, on a domestic flight. They went first to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, where they traded some passengers for a Japanese vice minister of transportation, then to <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION>, capital of communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, where the rest of the hostages were freed. Police said <PERSON> Shibata </PERSON> returned to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in April 1985 by an unknown route, held part-time jobs and traveled several times to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> on the false passport. <PERSON> Shibata </PERSON> is the only one of the nine alleged hijackers arrested, and police say he is the only one known to have returned to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. One of the others is said to have died in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> recently of an undisclosed illness. A spokesman for the national police said recently, on condition of anonymity, that he was certain North Korean officials knew of <PERSON> Shibata </PERSON>'s return to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. `` He could n't have left <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> without the permission of the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> government,'' the spokesman said. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> called Japanese allegations of North Korean complicity `` groundless slanders'' and said of the hijackers: `` We did not mind where they went, regarding it as their right proceeding from their free will.'' Japanese officials said police had questioned <PERSON> Shibata </PERSON> about his activities in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> but said it still was too early to say whether <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> was being used as a <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> base. <PERSON> Osamu </PERSON> <PERSON> Maruoka </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s reputed No. 2 man, and <PERSON> Yu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON>, an alleged <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> member arrested in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in April for possessing explosives, are believed to have traveled in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> before their arrests. <PERSON> Maruoka </PERSON> was arrested in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in November. Two more <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> suspects, <PERSON> Junzo </PERSON> <PERSON> Okudaira </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fusako </PERSON> <PERSON> Shigenobu </PERSON>, are being sought by police in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> for suspected involvement in a car bomb attack at a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military club in <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION>, also in April. The arrests and bombing have caused speculation that the long-dormant terrorist group is planning a comeback, possibly on the occasion of the <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> summit of seven industrialized countries June 19-21, or the 1988 Olympics in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, beginning in September. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> was formed in 1968 and had no more than 300 members at its peak, police say. Following police crackdowns in the late 1960s, about 30 members slipped out of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to operate abroad.

<HEAD>Ethics Committee Gets Formal Complaint To Investigate Wright</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID PACE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A conservative <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> congressman, supported by 71 <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> colleagues, asked the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee Thursday to investigate allegations that Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> has violated <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics rules. The request from Rep. <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, a leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> right in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, came one week after a similar call from the government watchdog group <ORGANIZATION> Common </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cause </ORGANIZATION> for an ethics committee investigation of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. Under House rules, <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>'s complaint will require the panel, formally known as the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Official </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conduct </ORGANIZATION>, to vote on whether to investigate <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>. The committee is made up of six Democrats and six Republicans. Rep. <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Calif., chairman of the committee, declined comment on <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>'s complaint, but <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> told reporters he hoped the committee will resolve the issue quickly `` I feel certain I have not violated House rules,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said. `` I most certainly have never intended to do so.'' As for <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, who has been calling publicly for such an investigation since December, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said, `` My views toward him are similar to those of a fire hydrant toward dogs.'' <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>'s complaint asked the ethics committee to investigate published allegations about <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> in four areas, two of which involved his book, `` Reflections of a Public Man.'' The complaint cited reports that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> received unusually high royalties of 55 percent on the book, which was published by a printing company that received nearly $ 300,000 worth of business from <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s campaign committee in 1985-86. The complaint asked the committee to determine if the royalty arrangement violated House rules and if <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s relationship with the company was used by the speaker as a way to convert campaign funds to personal use. The complaint also asked for an investigation into published reports of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s 1979 intervention with Egyptian President <PERSON> Anwar </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON> in behalf of a businessman who earlier had allowed <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> to invest in a proven oil well, and his 1979 intervention with the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> to influence a gas lease decision involving a company in which <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> owned $ 15,000 worth of stock. He said the incidents provide `` direct examples of the use of public office for personal enrichment.'' Common Cause cited <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s book and his financial dealings with its publisher in its call for an investigation last week, but not the two 1979 incidents. The self-styled citizens lobby also asked for an investigation into allegations that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> violated federal ethics rules while seeking special treatment from the federal <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> for <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> constituents and Democratic contributors.

 An intense propane fire ran out of gas Thursday, ending a two-day ordeal that forced 500 families from their homes and shut down a commuter railroad line to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The fire in a 2,500-gallon tanker, overturned on the <LOCATION> Seaford-Oyster </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Expressway </LOCATION>, burned itself out at 6:30 a.m. `` The tank was empty,'' Inspector <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Finkelman </PERSON> of the county fire marshal's office. `` It literally ran out of gas.'' `` It was the equivalent of a small bomb,'' <LOCATION> Nassau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Executive <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Gulotta </PERSON> said. `` If this tank had exploded it would have devastated everything within a 1,000-foot radius.'' <PERSON> Finkelman </PERSON> said the fire burned out sooner than expected, probably because the tanker was not full when it overturned Tuesday. It also burned faster after firefighters opened a vent on the tanker Wednesday to increase consumption of the liquid. Within three hours after the fire was out, <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rail </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION> began operating trains again on the Babylon line. The truck overturned just 2,000 feet south of the <ORGANIZATION> LIRR </ORGANIZATION> track. The Sunrise Highway and the Seaford-Oyster Bay Expressway also were reopened. <ORGANIZATION> LIRR </ORGANIZATION> said 30,000 rail commuters were affected. And 70,000 motorists were forced to find alternate routes. About 500 families were urged to evacuate, and many slept in cots in school gymnasiums. The accident occurred when defective springs in the truck broke, shifting the truck's weight, which in turn caused the drive shaft to separate and the rear portion to dig into the ground. The broken shaft acted as a catapult, overturning the truck, said <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Cynar </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> Gulotta </PERSON>. The driver and a passenger escaped with minor cuts and bruises. The driver was charged with driving with a suspended license. <PERSON> Gulotta </PERSON> said the county may sue Conservative Gas of <LOCATION> Wyandanch </LOCATION>, which owned the tanker and serves 40,000 residential and commercial customers. <LOCATION> Nassau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Comptroller <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> said the emergency cost the county more than $ 300,000 in overtime, salaries and equipment.

<HEAD>Study Says Rival Afghan Guerrilla Groups Will Rush for Kabul</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BEN DOBBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Rival Afghan guerrilla groups will race to seize <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> from the Communist government when Soviet troops are gone, and the result could be chaos, the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. It also predicted in its annual survey that the U.S.-Soviet summit starting Sunday in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> will produce a reasonable chance of agreement before President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> leaves office on cutting stocks of long-range nuclear weapons in half. `` I do n't expect a deal to be cut at the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit, but I think we can forsee progress,'' <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Binnendijk </PERSON> told a news conference Wednesday before the `` Strategic Survey 1987-88'' was released. He is director of studies for the London-based research group. `` There is a reasonable prospect that this can be settled before the end of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration'' in January, he said. The survey said the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> may try to retain influence in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> by exploiting ethnic rivalries and would prefer Lebanon-style chaos to the total collapse of the government it leaves behind. The Soviets have agreed to withdraw their estimated soldiers within nine months. `` If and when the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> withdraws from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> ... there will be a race to <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>'' by guerrilla groups, according to the 240-page report. It said the seven-party alliance of Moslem guerrillas probably will collapse and the remnants of President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s administration `` could seek out local alliances with parts of the warring factions.'' `` There could be a power vacuum in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> and isolated fronts fighting each other on the basis of ethnic and political rivalries, allowing the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to retain a foothold,'' the survey said. `` Chaos and the ` Lebanonization' ... are better outcomes for <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> than signing the death warrant'' of <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s regime. A tribally fragmented <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> would suit <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> as a buffer zone with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, and also <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, which wants to retain supremacy with the Shiite Moslem minorities, the study found. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> are <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s neighbors on the east and west. <PERSON> Binnendijk </PERSON>'s organization sees the possibility of the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> retaining bases in northern <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and direct influence over the area. `` Were this to turn out to be the eventual ` solution,' it would at best produce a stabilization of the ` warring kingdoms' under a weak central government; at worst it would result in complete chaos, leading sooner or later to yet another Afghan crisis,'' the report said. Moslem guerrillas began fighting after a Communist coup in April 1978, and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> sent military forces to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979. The Soviet withdrawal began May 15 and half its soldiers are to be out by Aug. 15. The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> is an international, non-governmental center for research on security and arms control funded largely by private foundations. Its members and staff come from 70 countries. On East-West relations, the survey said the superpower agreement to eliminate medium-range nuclear missiles and other developments during 1987 created `` the sense that significant, and perhaps fundamental, changes were under way was almost palpable.'' Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms coincided with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s `` vision of a non-nuclear world and his apparent wish.. to leave his stamp on history,'' the report said. `` It was the confluence of both superpowers' views that each could gain from a change in their security relationship and their respective adjustments to economic difficulties that produced the sense that 1987 might be a watershed year,'' the researchers concluded. They reached these conclusions in two other areas: <LOCATION> MIDDLE </LOCATION> <LOCATION> EAST </LOCATION> _ There is `` a shift of focus among key <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> governments'' to the view that the Iran-Iraq war, nearly eight years old, is a greater threat to their security than <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> LATIN </LOCATION> <LOCATION> AMERICA </LOCATION> _ Drug dealers emerged as `` a pre-eminent national security concern'' in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, and in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> narcotics traffickers led by Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> `` have become the government... In its ability to subvert societies and seize control of governments, ` narcoterrorism' may already be on a par with communism as a threat to Western interests in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.''

<HEAD>First Blood Tests On `Ranch Hand' Sprayers Shows High Dioxin
Levels</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Blood tests on <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> veterans who were assigned to spray defoliants like Agent Orange in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> show `` unusually heavy'' levels of exposure to dioxin, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> said Thurdsay. The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> reported results of blood testing among 147 <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> men who served in the `` Operation Ranch Hand'' defoliation activities. But the report drew no conclusion about how _ if at all _ the men's dioxin exposure might affect their health. At least 1,200 men participated in `` Operation Ranch Hand,'' the code name for the continuing aerial spraying conducted by the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> during the Vietnam War. The high levels exposure to the toxic chemical among the Ranch Hand personnel did n't necessarily come as a surprise, said Dr. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Needham </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> researcher. Sixty-two percent, or 91, of the 147 Ranch Hand veterans who were tested showed blood-dioxin levels of more than 20 parts per trillion, commonly regarded as the upper threshold for dioxin exposure in the general population, <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> researchers said. The average blood-dioxin level among the men was 49 parts per trillion; three Ranch Hand airmen had exposure levels over 200 parts per trillion and two had levels over 300 parts per trillion, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said. In a `` control'' group of 49 veterans, tested for comparison purposes, only one man had a blood-dioxin level over 20 parts per trillion _ and he had been exposed to industrial chemicals since 1980 at an <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> steel foundry, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said. The blood tests indicate `` that some Ranch Hand personnel had unusually heavy TCDD -LRB- dioxin -RRB- exposure,'' the Atlanta-based agency said. However, the agency noted, `` no threshold level has been determined as yet for the health effects of <ORGANIZATION> TCDD </ORGANIZATION> in humans.'' Earlier, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> reported on blood-dioxin levels among Army ground troops potentially exposed to Agent Orange, <PERSON> Needham </PERSON> noted. `` The one big difference we are seeing,'' he said, `` is the ... Army ground troops ... did not seem to have elevated exposures.'' Only two out of 646 such soldiers had blood-dioxin levels over 20 parts per trillion, <ORGANIZATION> Needham </ORGANIZATION> said. Dioxin is a toxic chemical to which virtually all people have been exposed somewhat, through the environment. However, dioxin contamination of Agent Orange and other herbicides used to clear the jungles in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> war operations has prompted concern about the health of military personnel exposed to such agents. A study released in March showed no unusual health problems to date among more than 1,000 <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans who were involved in the spraying of Agent Orange. That study drew criticism because it used estimated exposure levels. New techniques make it possible for scientists to detect dioxin levels in human blood even years after exposure. The test results announced Thursday, part of a 1987-88 <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> investigation, are from the first `` appreciable'' number of those tests performed on Ranch Hand personnel, <ORGANIZATION> Needham </ORGANIZATION> said. A report on the 1987-88 <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Study </ORGANIZATION> will be published after blood-dioxin tests have been completed on all participants and the report passes executive branch review, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said.

He said <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> was committed to 13 episodes of `` Frank's Place.'' `` The decision to cancel the Emmy-winning drama ` <ORGANIZATION> Cagney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Lacey </PERSON>' was a close call and was not made until Tuesday,'' said <PERSON> LeMasters </PERSON> `` But the show had suffered the slings and arrows.

News show writers are not member of the striking <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> LeMasters </PERSON> said the shows were kept on the schedule on the basis of quality.

 A decomposed body found Thursday in a mortician's bag may be that of reputed mobster <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> DiGilio </PERSON>, who disappeared three weeks ago, state and federal officials said. `` There's every reason to believe it is <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> DiGilio </PERSON>,'' said Col. <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pagano </PERSON>, superintendent of state police. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Alito </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said credit cards with <PERSON> DiGilio </PERSON>'s name on them were found on the body. If the body is not too decomposed, fingerprints could be taken for identification, he said. `` We want to get the dental records,'' said <LOCATION> Bayonne </LOCATION> police Capt. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Lavin </PERSON>. `` That's how badly decomposed it was.'' Authorities identify <PERSON> DiGilio </PERSON>, a 55-year-old former boxer, as a soldier in the Genovese organized crime family. After his disappearance was reported May 7, law enforcement officials speculated he was killed in an organized crime dispute. <PERSON> DiGilio </PERSON> was a colorful figure, acting as his own attorney in a federal waterfront racketeering trial that ended with his acquittal last month, often inviting boxing celebrities to court and filing a harassment suit against federal officials. That flamboyance, authorities say, may have led to his death. Intelligence indicated that other <PERSON> Genovese </PERSON> family members were dissatisfied with <PERSON> DiGilio </PERSON>'s high profile, and that reputed family boss <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> `` Chin'' <PERSON> Gigante </PERSON> sanctioned the hit, officials said. <PERSON> DiGilio </PERSON> was to be sentenced on a state loansharking charge May 19, and authorities had also speculated his disappearance was a ploy connected with sentencing. He has won frequent delays in trials through claims of mental problems. But at the sentencing hearing, <PERSON> DiGilio </PERSON>'s lawyer said the only likely reason for his client's absence was foul play. At the court proceeding, the judge issued a warrant for <PERSON> DiGilio </PERSON>'s arrest.

 Constitutional grounds probably exist to appeal the sentence of an 18-year-old woman convicted of child abuse and ordered to practice birth control for the remainder of her child-bearing years, her defense attorney said Thursday. Also Thursday, <PERSON> Debra </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Forster </PERSON>'s mother said she understood the judge's decision `` to an extent'' but hoped the birth-control requirement could be dropped eventually. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Billar </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Maricopa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> deputy public defender, said he will recommend that his office appeal the Ms. <PERSON> Forster </PERSON>'s sentence, including `` obviously the provisions for mandatory birth control.'' Possible grounds include `` constitutional rights to privacy, religion and so forth,'' he said. Ms. <PERSON> Forster </PERSON> is Roman Catholic; the church opposes artificial birth control. On Tuesday, a <ORGANIZATION> Maricopa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge sentenced Ms. <PERSON> Forster </PERSON> to lifetime probation, with the provisions that she remain on birth control during her child-bearing years and not see any of her three children, one of whom was born in jail. She had pleaded guilty in April to two counts of felony child abuse for leaving her two young sons alone in an apartment during a hot-weather spell, without food or water, for three days last May. She could have received 30 years in prison. Ms. <PERSON> Forster </PERSON>'s two boys, 18-month-old <PERSON> William </PERSON> and 6-month-old <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, were hospitalized eight days for malnutrition, lesions caused by a rash and dehydration. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> was close to death from dehydration when he was found by Ms. <PERSON> Forster </PERSON>'s estranged husband, police said. Ms. <PERSON> Forster </PERSON> told Judge <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> <PERSON> Budzyn </PERSON> she left the children because she could not cope with the pressures of taking care of them alone. <PERSON> Budzyn </PERSON> said Wednesday the birth-control requirement was the only way she could make sure the woman would not abuse other children. Society offers little or no support to help those who are under stress so that they do not abuse their children, the judge said. `` We do n't have a lot of help out there for people,'' she said. <PERSON> Budzyn </PERSON> indicated that Ms. <PERSON> Forster </PERSON>'s probation terms, like those of all cases, could be modified in the future if requested by Ms. <PERSON> Forster </PERSON> or her probation officer. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Golotte </PERSON>, Ms. <PERSON> Forster </PERSON>'s mother, said Thursday from <LOCATION> Amelia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, she understood the sentence `` to an extent'' and that the birth-control requirement is reasonable for the next several years while the daughter gets life `` back together.'' However, Ms. <PERSON> Golotte </PERSON> also said she hoped the requirement could be dropped eventually. `` Later, down the road, people do change, and what if she decides to get married and start her life all over again? What is there for her to look forward to?''' the mother asked. Ms. <PERSON> Golotte </PERSON> also said she disagreed with <PERSON> Budzyn </PERSON>'s statement that Ms. <PERSON> Forster </PERSON>'s case was an example of children having children. `` I think a lot of it has to do with drugs,'' she said. `` I do n't think it was because <PERSON> Debra </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> was not mature enough to have children.'' Ms. <PERSON> Golotte </PERSON>, 33, said that she was 15 when her daughter was born and that her own mother gave birth to her also at age 15. A Catholic church official joined civil liberties advocates in criticizing the sentence. The Rev. <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Davern </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diocese </LOCATION> vice chancellor, said that he objected to the sentence on the grounds of religious liberty and what he called its contradictory message. Ms. <PERSON> Forster </PERSON> has been sentenced to a lifetime of probation counseling, he said, but `` the judge seems to be saying that no amount of counseling could help this person grow to be a whole person.'' `` I'm not trying to minimize what she did, but how much does the average person change between the ages of 20 and 30?,'' <PERSON> Davern </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Forster </PERSON> gave birth to a daughter while in jail awaiting trial on the child abuse charges. According to court records, a family friend adopted the daughter, and the sons were being placed through an adoption agency.

 The Soviet parliament approved legislation Thursday making it easier for private cooperatives to compete with state-run businesses and giving local authorities power to promote certain goods and services with tax breaks. The Supreme Soviet, the country's nominal parliament, made some rare amendments to the law and held back the tax structure for further changes. The moves came in a three-day session that ended Thursday after much debate. The Supreme Soviet normally only approves laws put forward by the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Debate over the cooperative law, which delayed the vote for a day, underscored a greater willingness and ability to speak out under Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of greater openness Officials said that in three months of public debate about the law before it reached the Supreme Soviet, 42 of its 50 articles had been amended. The amended law, which passed unanimously Thursday as is traditional, goes into effect July 1. `` Local Soviets -LRB- governing councils -RRB- and other state bodies can set a preferential tax system on cooperatives and ... members,'' said <PERSON> Alexei </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponomarev </PERSON>, the head of a Supreme Soviet commission that reported on the cooperative law to the parliament Thursday. The law, as initially presented, had given only national officials the right to give tax breaks. The adopted law also guarantees that cooperatives can not be run out of business by state-run enterprises. It allows them to conduct business with foreign companies and receive hard currency as payment; to own buildings and other property; and to appeal decisions by authorities not to license a cooperative. Cooperatives are owned by the people who work in them and represent a small sector of the Soviet economy, which is dominated by state-run ventures. The arrangement is permissible under Marxist theory, which teaches that workers are exploited if they work for anyone other than the state or themselves. A law permitting formation of cooperatives has been adopted under <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. Soviet Premier <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> said Tuesday that 14,000 cooperatives were formed in the first 18 months of the law and another 6,000 in the past three months. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has said he is depending on their development to provide consumer goods and services that the inefficient state-run economy can not provide. Restaurants are one of the most popular forms of cooperatives that have opened. Others have formed to make clothing, pump gas, make home repairs and provide other services. In debate Wednesday in the Soviet of Nationalities, one of the two chambers of parliament, deputy <PERSON> Georgy </PERSON> <PERSON> Tarazevich </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Minsk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Byelorussia </LOCATION>, said local authorities should be given the right to give tax breaks to encourage production of goods and services they think are necessary. `` In my view, it's necessary to transfer to local Soviets the tax policy regarding cooperatives,'' he said in remarks reprinted by the government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Ponomarev </PERSON> said the overall tax structure also would be reworked, allowing flexibility depending on `` market conditions as well as the activity of cooperatives.'' But he did not say whether the specific tax rates in the law would be reconsidered. Under the law as presented on Tuesday, personal income taxes would be 27 percent on a monthly income of $ 1,600 and 53.5 percent on an income of $ 3,200. The tax rate eventually reaches 90 percent. The average industrial worker in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> makes about $ 320 a month. Officials have said the aim of the progressive tax system is to encourage the cooperatives to invest in expanding business rather than paying high salaries to workers.

 The nation's mayors complained to a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel on Thursday that local governments face continued delays in receiving federal monies for anti-drug programs. <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, Mayor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Berkley </PERSON>, speaking on behalf of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mayors </ORGANIZATION>, blamed the delays on administrative problems of state governments as well as the federal government. `` Frankly we are frustrated with the bureaucracy and we are disheartened by the lack of support from the federal government,'' <PERSON> Berkley </PERSON> said in prepared testimony. `` The drug problem is in the streets, the schools, the playgrounds of our cities. The hand-to-hand combat is in the cities.'' <PERSON> Berkley </PERSON>, president of the mayors group, asked the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Narcotics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abuse </ORGANIZATION> to change the law so federal aid could be sent directly to cities. State agencies now distribute most of the money after receiving it from the federal government. State and local governments are to receive about $ 456 million for drug programs in the current budget year, of which $ 70 million is for enforcement, $ 230 million for education and $ 156 million for treatment, according to the mayors. A <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official acknowledged to the committee that there had been `` some delay'' by states in preparing and submitting applications for anti-drug monies in 1987, but he maintained `` all of those are understandable'' because of the time required to collect needed data and prepare spending plans. `` There is no delay on the part of the federal government,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Abell </PERSON>, assistant attorney general in the dpartment's office of justice programs He said the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> took an average of 37 days to release monies to a state after it submitted its drug program plan. <PERSON> Berkley </PERSON>'s remarks reiterated criticisms made last year by the mayors that federal and state government were not quickly distributing monies to cities for programs established after a highly publicized 1986 anti-drug crusade by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. <PERSON> Berkley </PERSON> also objected to the administration's proposed elimination of federal aid for drug law enforcement in fiscal year 1989, which starts Oct. 1. `` This is not the way to wage a war on anything,'' <PERSON> Berkley </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Berkley </PERSON> welcomed <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s proposed 1989 increases of $ 10 million for treatment and $ 20 million for drug education.

 A 78-year-old retired farmer will serve at least 28 months in prison for the shooting death of his wife, who suffered from Alzheimer's disease, a judge ruled Thursday. <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>, who has said he shot his 71-year-old wife, <PERSON> Agnes </PERSON>, in February to end her suffering from the disease, will begin serving his time at the <LOCATION> Stillwater </LOCATION> state prison immediately. <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON> gave <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> a 43-month sentence. With good behavior, <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> would be eligible for parole in 28 months. <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON> recommended that <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> later be placed in one of the state's least restrictive facilities. That decision would be made by the state commissioner of corrections. With good behavior, <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> would be eligible for parole in 28 months. Before the sentencing, <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> told <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON> that he was `` so sorry'' for what happened to his wife of 45 years. Speaking in a faltering voice and sometimes breaking into tears, <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON> to place him in a nursing home instead of sending him to prison. `` I hope you will put me in a home, someplace where I can be of some good to somebody,'' <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>'s attorneys had hoped that <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>, who they said had never even received a traffic ticket, would not have to serve time in prison. <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> pleaded guilty several weeks ago to second-degree murder after <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON> said he would consider a maximum 43-month sentence. That agreement departs from state sentencing guidelines, which call for an 18-year sentence for second-degree murder. <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> said in court Thursday during a pre-sentence hearing that he snapped when he received the news Feb. 28 that his wife had broken her hip and would have to be hospitalized. The next day, he took an old pistol to the <LOCATION> Crestview </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Manor </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nursing </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Home </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Evansville </LOCATION> where she lived and shot her four times. `` I just cracked up. I just could n't take no more,'' <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> said. Douglas County Attorney <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrott </PERSON> had opposed the 43-month sentence. She said that she feels compassion toward <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>, but believes sentencing guidelines should be followed. She also presented a witness Wednesday who suggested that <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> had abused his wife and another who said he had complained about the high cost of his wife's care prior to her death. However, the nursing director of the home testified under cross-examination that an investigation had shown no abuse of Mrs. <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> testified last month that his wife asked to be shot. <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> said he shot her four times with a .22 - caliber pistol and then sat down to pray and watch her All three of <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>'s daughters testified last month that they hoped their father would be shown leniency because of the strain he was under and his age.

 Iranian gunboats attacked and set ablaze a fully-laden Norwegian-operated tanker Thursday as it was sailing out of the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, shipping executives said. No casualties were reported. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said its anti-aircraft gunners shot down an Iranian F-5 fighter over the battlefield in the <LOCATION> Salamcheh </LOCATION> sector near <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s southern port of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said it sent thousands of volunteers Thursday to the battlefront after their positions east of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION> fell in a lightning assault Wednesday. Iranians hit the 15,530-ton liquefied petroleum gas carrier <PERSON> Mundogas </PERSON> <PERSON> Rio </PERSON> at 7:45 p.m. as it sailed out of the Strait of <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION> and tried to jam its radio communications, said the shipping executives, speaking on condition of anonymity. But the signal for help by the Liberian-flagged tanker, which carried a shipment of Saudi Arabian oil products, was picked up by another unidentified commercial ship in the vicinity, the executives said. It was the third attack by the Iranians on neutral shipping since <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> broadened the duties of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> in the gulf, allowing warships to interevene in attacks on commercial vessels, even if they are not sailing under the Stars and Stripes. The executives said they were not aware of any <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> warships in the area at the time of the attack. They said the captain of the stricken vessel reported a small fire aboard the ship but no casualties among the crew. The fire was quickly extinguished and the vessel sailed at full speed toward the <LOCATION> Omani </LOCATION> port of Fujairah, outside the <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION>, said the sources. Elsewhere, a <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> communique said <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> warplanes `` scored effective and accurate hits'' in a raid on the Imam <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> oilfield in southwestern <LOCATION> Khuzestan </LOCATION> province in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s bombing campaign against Iranian oil lines. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> reported heavy artillery and mortar battles in the <LOCATION> Salamcheh </LOCATION> sector, recaptured Wednesday by an estimated 35,000 Iraqi troops. Wednesday's 10-hour battle, <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s third major military defeat in five weeks, underlined a dramatic turnaround in the 7 -LCB- - year-old war The Iraqis recaptured the <ORGANIZATION> Faw </ORGANIZATION> peninsula south of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION>, ending two years of Iranian occupation, in a two-day April offensive. On April 18, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> sank an Iranian frigate and several other craft and disabled a second frigate. The official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, acknowledged that Iranian forces `` had to retreat from parts of the area they had captured earlier.'' It said the Iranians were now in `` new positions'' but gave no details in one of <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s rare declarations of a military setback. <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION>, also monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, said `` large numbers'' of volunteers have been dispatched to the battlefront from 19 cities across <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> by <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s government.

<HEAD>Boatmen, Fishermen Threaten to Resume Fishing Boycott</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Fishers threatened Thursday to end a weeklong truce in the Great Anglers' Strike after they spotted government inspectors checking for fishing licenses. Fishers and boatmen said they would renew a boycott of Irish lakes and rivers Friday to protest the new law requiring anglers to buy licenses for the first time. After the law was announced in April, angling clubs declared their waters off-limits to fishing. Hotels told guests to stay away, and fishing stores refused to sell licenses. The Roman Catholic archbishop of <LOCATION> Tuam </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Cassidy </PERSON>, announced he had negotiated a deal with the government that prevented the law from being implemented until further talks. Fishers said the appearance of the two inspectors in western <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> betrayed the terms of the deal. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boatmen </ORGANIZATION>, which represents lake fishing boats, said the boycott would resume Friday. `` The only talking we will do is through Archbishop <PERSON> Cassidy </PERSON> directly to the government,'' <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> said. The licenses cost from $ 15.60 to $ 26.50, depending on the type of fish sought. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinnott </PERSON>, chairman of <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tourism </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, said more protests could harm western <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s $ 60 million dollar tourism industry.

<HEAD>Autos, Textiles Free-Trade Agreement Losers, Study Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM BOVEE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> auto and textile industries would be losers in barrier-free trade between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, while industrial machinery, electronics and energy-intensive businesses would be winners, a private study concluded Thursday. The study by the <ORGANIZATION> Northeast-Midwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, issued as congressional committees considered whether to recommend approval of a free-trade treaty between the two countries, said the agreement broke new ground in easing trade barriers but failed to eliminate some long-standing trade problems. If approved, the agreement `` probably will increase bilateral trade, particularly between <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Northeast-Midwest </LOCATION> region,'' the study said. `` However, the impact of the proposed agreement likely would be uneven, with some industries gaining and others losing. `` While the agreement would provide freer trade, its overall impact on the balance of trade remains uncertain,'' said the institute, which is a nonpartisan research group established at the behest of members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to serve senators and representatives of 18 northeastern and midwestern states. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> automotive industry would suffer because the agreement would retain through 1996 Canadian programs giving breaks on duties to third-country manufacturers. That provision would enable Canadian parts suppliers to build long-term ties with foreign-owned auto manufacturers, and `` the program's distortive trade and investment effects would remain in effect long after these duty remissions schemes were terminated,'' the study said. The treaty's requirement that at least half the content of any auto crossing the border duty-free be <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> is not stringent enough to prevent the purchase of engines, drive trains and vehicle electronics from third countries, the study said. The proposed 10-year phaseout of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s 9.2 percent tariff on automotive goods would discriminate against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> makers while giving their Canadian counterparts duty-free access to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> markets, the study said. Canadian tariffs on textiles, which range from 17.5 percent to 25.5 percent, would remain higher than <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> duties throughout a 10-year phaseout period, `` maintaining a more restrictive barrier for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> producers selling in the Canadian market,'' the study said. The agreement would give Canadian textile makers a 56 million yard quota for duty-free treatment of apparel made from imported fabric, double last year's shipments to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, while <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturers could ship only 11.5 million yards, the amount of last year's exports to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, the study said. That lower level for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` would limit opportunities for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> producers to penetrate the Canadian market,'' the study said. The free-trade agreement, by eliminating over five years tariffs on most industrial machinery produced for shipment to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, would allow exports of such products to become a leading growth sector in the region, the report said. <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> is the largest market for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> electronics exports. Immediate removal of tariffs on data processing equipment and telephone sets and gradual elimination of tariffs on telecommunications equipment would increase <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> electronics exports further, the study said. Chemical processors, fertilizer manufacturers, food processors, metal casting plants and pulp, paper and lumber mills would gain greater reliability in their supply of low-cost Canadian hydroelectric power and natural gas through provisions of the agreement preventing new quotas, taxes or price requirements, the study said.

<HEAD>Vietnam Says It Will Withdraw From Cambodia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> announced Thursday it will withdraw 50,000 soldiers from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> beginning next month and will complete the pullout from its Southeast Asian neighbor in 1990. The development came in advance of Sunday's start of the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit, at which President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he would ask Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to encourage the Vietnamese to resolve the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> conflict. From <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> quoted <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s defense and foreign affairs ministries as saying the pullout would cut the number of troops in half, or to about 50,000. According to American estimates, the move would leave 70,000 to 75,000 of <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>'s forces battling guerrillas in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. The withdrawal, by land and sea routes, is to take place between June and December. Communiques from the defense ministries of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> said the two governments had agreed the remaining Vietnamese troops would be placed under the command of the Phnom Penh government. The announcements, monitored in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, were carried by radio <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> and the official Cambodian news agency <ORGANIZATION> SPK </ORGANIZATION>. The Soviet-armed Vietnamese invaded <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in late 1978, overthrowing the regime of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> and setting up a pro-Hanoi government in <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION>. They are fighting guerrillas backed by <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, non-communist Southeast Asian countries and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The 50,000 or more guerrillas, including the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, are grouped in a coalition led by Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, the former head of state. In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Igor </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogachev </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s planned withdrawal could improve relations between the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and indicates `` a political decision can be reached'' in the conflict. `` We think this opens a direct avenue for the speedy solution to the problems around Kampuchea -LRB- <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> -RRB- and for turning it into a zone of peace,'' <PERSON> Rogachev </PERSON> said at a press conference. He noted the withdrawal will eliminate two of the three issues considered obstacles by the Chinese in normalizing relations between the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The Chinese have said relations will improve only when the Soviets withdraw from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, a process begun May 15; the Vietnamese end their occupation of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>; and the Soviets agree to reduce troops along the Sino-Soviet border. The Cambodian news agency said that over the past nine years, the <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> government `` has gradually undertaken the defense work by itself, thus creating the conditions for six annual withdrawals of Vietnamese volunteer troops from Kampuchea -LRB- <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> -RRB-. `` This time, the command of the Vietnamese volunteer army in <LOCATION> Kampuchea </LOCATION> will also be pulled out ... and the remaining Vietnamese troops in <LOCATION> Kampuchea </LOCATION> are to be placed under the command of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kampuchea </ORGANIZATION> until their complete withdrawal in 1990.'' In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the official <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanoi </ORGANIZATION>, monitored by <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, quoted <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> as announcing that outsiders would be allowed to watch the pullout. This year's partial withdrawal would be by far the largest of the six that <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> claims to have made since 1982. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> says the only genuine withdrawal occurred last November, when 20,000 troops went home. Although pledging to completely withdraw by 1990, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has warned it will take action if <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas try to retake power. In <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, a spokesman for <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Eng </PERSON>, said he welcomed the announced withdrawal but said <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> should accept <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>'s proposal for an international peacekeeping force to verify the pullout and to prevent the Vietnamese and the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> from returning. A senior Western embassy official said <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> was able to withdraw forces last November because of the low level of military activity in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in the past year. The strategy of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, the most powerful of the guerrilla groups, has been to gain control of the villages and avoid direct clashes with the Vietnamese, apparently to preserve its forces for the 1990 withdrawal, he said. He said the Vietnamese were moving into the interior, leaving the <ORGANIZATION> Phnom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penh </ORGANIZATION> forces to guard the <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> border area, the traditional zone of fighting.

 <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>, an ex-Secret Service agent who once guarded President <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s family, quit Thursday as head of the police department after a 2 -LCB- - year tenure that restored morale to a force laced with corruption and reeling from the MOVE catastrophe `` It was a high honor and privilege to serve this city,'' <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>, 47, said at a news conference. His resignation takes effect June 10. Mayor <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> <PERSON> Goode </PERSON> praised <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> for bringing `` integrity and pride to a department in crisis.'' <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> said he wants to spend more time with his wife and children living in nearby <LOCATION> Medford </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J </LOCATION>. He has been living in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, as is required under home rule charter. `` I do n't want to go into the specifics of my personal reasons, but I have a lease that is expiring and I have been wanting to spend more time with my kids,'' <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> said. `` One of my disappointments was being away from my family.'' <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> indicated that he will take a little time before taking on an undisclosed job in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>'s private sector. `` I leave with a very good feeling for this city, and I look forward to being part of this city as a citizen,'' he said before the news conference. <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> took over a morale-shattered department, reeling from extortion convictions of 34 people, including a deputy commissioner, in January 1986. Seven months earlier was the confrontation with the radical group MOVE, in which police dropped a bomb that killed 11 people and destroyed 61 houses. The police commissioner's job was vacated by <PERSON> Gregore </PERSON> <PERSON> Sambor </PERSON>, who was in charge during the MOVE siege and the federal investigations that led to extortion charges against members of the force. When <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> took over, he was the first outsider to head the 6,700-member force in more than 60 years. He told <PERSON> Goode </PERSON> then he did n't plan to make it a lifetime career and only wanted to instill pride in the police force in the nation's fifth-largest city. During his tenure, he even earned the respect of the Fraternal Order of Police, who often opposed his clean-the-house methods that included shakeups of personnel, drug examinations and lie detector tests. FOP President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurst </PERSON> blamed the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and mayor for <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>'s resignation, alleging that failure to provide money to hire more officers and pay for needed reforms had soured him. `` They've devastated and ruined the department, and as a result the only shining star in the <PERSON> Goode </PERSON> administration is walking out on them. He is a visionary. It is demoralizing to lose him,'' <PERSON> Hurst </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>, who was a police officer in <LOCATION> Rahway </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, before joining the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in 1965, spent four years traveling around the world providing security for <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s widow, <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON>, and their two children. He was agent in charge of the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> office before resigning in May 1985 for a job in private business. <PERSON> Goode </PERSON> said he would appoint a successor from within the department, hopefully by the time <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> leaves. Among the leading candidates were two deputy commissioners, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> and <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, who were with <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> when he announced his resignation. <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>, the department's No. 2 man, declined to be drawn into a discussion of a successor except to say `` the choice is going to be competitive and I am proud to be part of the process.'' All <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> would say was `` there is a cadre of good men in the department who are capable of taking over the job.'' If appointed, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, 44, a member of the force since 1964 who was made a deputy commissioner by <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>, would be <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>'s first black police commissioner `` The decision will be made by the mayor, and I think he has a very difficult decision because of the good talent of people within this organization,'' <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Caplan </PERSON>, who headed a task force that studied the department for a year, said <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> `` got worn down'' trying to improve the department. `` None of it came easy,'' <PERSON> Caplan </PERSON> said. `` He not only had to educate the department, but develop a constituency within the city government, something that cost him an enormous emount of energy.''

<HEAD>Farm Exports To Hit Four-Year High This Year</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The value of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agricultural exports is expected to reach a four-year high of $ 33.5 billion this fiscal year, up from $ 27.9 billion in 1986-87, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. Actual quantities of shipments were forecast at 145.5 million metric tons, up from 129.2 million tons last year. Export values dropped to a decade low of $ 26.3 billion two years ago but improved slightly to $ 27.9 billion in 1986-87. The tonnage of shipments dropped to 109.5 million tons in 1985-86 before recovering in 1986-87. Despite this year's gains, the current estimates are still far below the record of $ 43.8 billion and 162.3 million tons established in 1980-81 before world economic conditions, high interest rates, foreign competition, a rising value of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar and other factors triggered the slide. The new forecast also was up by $ 1 billion and 3 million tons from <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s previous estimate on Feb. 25. Officials attributed the boost to a growth in animal and horticultural products and soybeans. The boost in tonnage `` reflects improved prospects for wheat, feed ingredients and soybeans,'' the report said. The value of animal products was boosted $ 600 million from the February forecast to a record of $ 5.6 billion this year, due to `` stronger-than-expected demand for hides, red meats and animal fats,'' the report said. `` Most of the increase in volume stems from larger grain exports as the Export Enhancement Program -LRB- EEP -RRB- and tighter competitor supplies boost the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> share of world markets,'' the report said. `` Also, higher prices are expected for grains, oilseeds and cotton.'' Under the <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> arrangement, selected countries _ including the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> _ have been getting wheat and other designated commodities at prices subsidized by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government. Imports of agricultural products this fiscal year were forecast at a record $ 21 billion, up $ 500 million from the February estimate. Last year's imports dropped slightly to $ 20.6 billion from $ 20.9 billion in 1985-86, the previous high mark. But as a result of export values climbing more rapidly, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agricultural trade balance _ the difference between exports and imports _ is expected to rise sharply to $ 12.5 billion from $ 7.3 billion last year. However, the 1987-88 balance would still be far less than the $ 19.1 billion edge <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farm exports had over imports in 1983-84.

<TEXT>
 An <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> medical unit's training trip to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> has been canceled, but an officer denied political developments there were the reason `` From what I can tell, the mission just was n't there,'' said Lt. Col. <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. `` There has to be things for the soldiers to do when they arrive, medical support missions, those kinds of things. There just was n't a mission that had enough things for them to do, I guess.'' The training exercise was scrapped after a Guard team had looked at the area, he said. Though Guard officials were monitoring the Panamanian situation, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said he doubted it was a factor. He said the decision against the trip was made earlier this month before the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> broke off negotiations with <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> military leader <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> for him to step down. The <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> unit's physicians, nurses, pharmacists and other medical personnel had been scheduled to work Aug. 4-18 in support of the staff at the <ORGANIZATION> Gorgas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> military facility in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Because of the change in plans, most of the unit's 156 members will spend that period at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> McCoy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, said Maj. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmid </PERSON>, executive officer of the 109th Medical Battalion. Another 34 will be assigned to duties in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> physicians, dentists, paramedics, dental technicians and other health personnel will work with medical forces from that country. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said the assistance had been requested by the Guatemalan government. The <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> will be the first unit to train in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, he said.

<TEXT>
 A decision by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to loosen up acreage controls on 1989 wheat production `` indicates the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> intends to be a grain seller, not a grain storer,'' the head of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wheat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Growers </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Johannsen </PERSON>, a wheat farmer from <LOCATION> Bayard </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, referred to a <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> announcement on Wednesday that producers would be required to idle no more than 10 percent of their wheat base acreage to qualify for 1989 program benefits. The acreage set-aside was 27.5 percent for 1988. <PERSON> Johannsen </PERSON> said the smaller land-idling requirement `` requires a continuing federal commitment'' to operate the Export Enchancement Program, or <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION>, which has helped reduce surplus <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat stockpiles. Under <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION>, selected foreign countries _ including the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> _ have been able to buy huge quantities of wheat at subsidized prices. `` We intend to work closely with <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to see that existing export assistance programs are used effectively and that the past over-supply of wheat not be allowed to reoccur,'' he said in statement released by the association's <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> office. `` For 50 years _ and often to its detriment _ the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has held virtually all the world's surplus grain,'' <PERSON> Johannsen </PERSON> added. `` With the 1989 wheat program, we shift that burden to our competitors.''

<HEAD>Senators Urge Administration To Halt Effort To Bar Abortion
Counseling</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A bipartisan group of 23 senators asked the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration Thursday to drop efforts to restrict counseling services at family planning clinics in light of three court injunctions against the policy. `` We urge you to abandon efforts to implement these unconstitutional regulations,'' Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Chafee </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-R.I. </LOCATION>, and 22 colleagues said in the letter to <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Otis </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON>. The administration has said its regulations were designed to strengthen the wall between federally funded family planning services, primarily aimed at low-income women, and abortion services, which the government does not subsidize. Among other things, doctors and counselors at clinics receiving federal grants would not be able to tell a pregnant woman that abortion was one of her options. Federal judges in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> issued injunctions against the regulations. The senators said recent statements indicate the administration plans to determine which family planning grant recipients are not affected by the injunctions and proceed with implementation and enforcement `` for these few and unfortunate programs.'' The nine Republicans and 14 Democrats said they were troubled by a policy that `` continues to press illegal, unconstitutional and medically unethical rules onto providers of such an important service.'' Th net result of pursuing the policy will be costly litigation and reduced services for the poor, they said. `` We respectfully urge you to put an end to this dispute and formally withdraw the regulations in question,'' the senators said. In addition to <PERSON> Chafee </PERSON>, those signing the letter were: <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, R-Wash.; <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Alaska </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, D-Ill.; <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stafford </PERSON>, R-Vt.; <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON>, R-Conn.; <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif.; <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON>, R-Ore.; <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kassebaum </PERSON>, R-Kan.; <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, R-Calif.; <PERSON> Spark </PERSON> <PERSON> Matsunaga </PERSON>; <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, D-Mich.; <PERSON> Quentin </PERSON> <PERSON> Burdick </PERSON>, D-N.D.; <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Mikulski </PERSON>, D-Md; <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, D-Wash.; <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>, D-Mich.; <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, D-Conn.; <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, D-Vt.; and <PERSON> John </PERSON>

<HEAD>Testing And Counseling Bill Approved By House Panel</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An AIDS testing and counseling bill in the works for more than a year cleared its first congressional panel Thursday, stripped of a controversial provision outlawing discrimination against victims of the fatal disease. The bill, approved on a voice vote by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> health subcommittee, authorizes $ 400 million next year and each of the following two years for new and expanded testing programs run by states, localities and private groups. Testing would have to be voluntary and accompanied by counseling. Anonymous testing and use of pseudonyms would have to be permitted to the extent possible under state laws. Health professionals or others who violated confidentiality standards outlined in the bill, intentionally or negligently, could be fined up to $ 10,000 for each offense. The measure is to be taken up by the full <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> next month, after which it goes to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor. A similar bill is pending in a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee. House members and their staffs haggled over the AIDS testing bill for six months before it was introduced last July, and negotiations continued right up until Thursday's vote. The key compromise was dropping the anti-discrimination section before considering the bill in subcommittee. `` Unfortunately, that policy is caught up in such controversy that we will not be able to pursue it at this time,'' subcommittee chairman <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>, D-Calif., said Monday when the panel began work on the bill <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Levi </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lesbian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, said the bill is worthwhile even without the discrimination ban `` because of the confidentiality provisions and because it mandates a minimum level of counseling'' including information on AIDS and how to avoid it. <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON> said federal laws and policies already make it clear that discrimination by government employers and contractors is unacceptable and he said many private employers `` already are acting responsibly.'' But Rep. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyden </PERSON>, D-Ore., said he would fight to restore the discrimination ban this year and, if he has to, in the next <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> `` There is a real question about the private sector,'' <PERSON> Wyden </PERSON> said. He also contended that `` many Americans will be reluctant to come forward for voluntary testing if they are then open to blatant discrimination on the basis of the results.'' The subcommittee considered dozens of amendments in the course of three days of work this week on the bill. The panel approved mandatory testing of people convicted of intravenous drug use, prostitution or a crime related to sexual assault and made it a crime for a person to contribute to a blood bank or have sexual relations if he knows he has AIDS or carries the AIDS virus. Amendments requiring testing of marriage license applicants and people admitted to hospitals were rejected. The subcommittee also refused to require that public health authorities be given the names, addresses and phone numbers of people who do n't have AIDS but test positive for the virus that causes it. In a final compromise Thursday, the subcommittee agreed to a section saying money under the bill can not be used for counseling `` that promotes or encourages, directly, homosexual or unsafe heterosexual activity or intravenous substance abuse.'' The amendment also says counselors must supply `` the most current scientific knowledge available ... provided that any informational materials used are not obscene.'' The amendment arose from an educational comic book and videotape produced by the Gay Men's Health Crisis in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, which receives federal money. Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Dannemeyer </PERSON>, R-Calif., said the comic book `` depicts two males in every state of undress and sexual contact the mind can conjure. AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is transmitted through sexual contact, needles or syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products, and from pregnant women to their offspring. There is no cure for the disease, which damages the body's immune system.

 A $ 110 million tax increase is on its way to <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' desk, a package that state Republicans hope will embarrass <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as he campaigns for president on a reputation as a tax-cutter. `` He's projecting himself as a tough law-and-order governor, as a hands-on manager and as a budget-balancer. He's none of those,'' Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Locke </PERSON>, a state co-chairman for Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, said Thursday. The tax package includes $ 70 million to couple the state income tax with the federal code and $ 40 million from a tobacco sales tax. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> approves the former but has sent mixed signals on the latter. The cigarette tax passed the state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday following a bizarre lock-out protest by Republican legislators. It is expected to land on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' desk after a rubber-stamp final vote by both houses. The governor's administration and finance secretary, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Keefe </PERSON>, supports the measure but <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aides hastily said that <PERSON> Keefe </PERSON> was speaking for himself. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, before leaving to campaign in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, insisted that the state can balance its books without the tax proposal. `` The governor's position has been, ` I'll take a look at it, I'm not supporting it,''' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' chief secretary, <PERSON> Hale </PERSON> <PERSON> Champion </PERSON>, said Thursday Asked about the cigarette tax, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told reporters Thursday, `` They'll be working this out, and when the budget gets to conference we'll sit down and decide if we need additional revenue.'' In an unusual legislative tactic, six <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republicans failed to return to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> chamber Wednesday evening. They locked themselves in a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> office and either took the phones off the hook or ignored calls from <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leaders. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democrats, in a voice vote, quickly passed the cigarette tax as well as the $ 70 million income tax coupling bill. The Republicans said they were hoping to delay action on the tax increase proposals while at the same time trying _ and succeeding _ to draw media attention to the tax bills. `` I would not be surprised if it were almost a Machiavellian plot -LRB- by Democrats -RRB- to put tax bills on his desk and have him veto them,'' <PERSON> Locke </PERSON> said. `` He is desperately trying to assume the mantle of a tax-cutter.'' Fellow GOP Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Cellucci </PERSON> sees the cigarette tax as a relatively minor issue compared to the state's budget woes. Lower-than-expected state revenues have forced several downward revisions in the $ 12 billion budget plan <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> filed in January. `` Why is the budget he filed at least half a billion dollars out of balance, if not more?'' <PERSON> Cellucci </PERSON> said. `` The answer is a simple one: there's been no discipline in spending.'' During floor debate, <PERSON> Locke </PERSON> called the proposal `` a premonition of what lies ahead for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' `` When they elect the Duke, this is exactly what you are going to get _ when they run out of dough, they raise taxes,'' he said. Senate President <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bulger </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> Democrat who supports <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, derided the Republican lock-out as a publicity stunt. `` The minority party was well aware of what's been going on,'' <PERSON> Bulger </PERSON> said. `` I'm not sure what constitutes childish behavior on the part of Republicans. There's no reason for them to have been gone for so long. ... Republicans know they're not smart. What they do is look for attention.''

 Democratic presidential front-runner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> pressed his demand Thursday for `` a full explanation'' of <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> links with <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and ridiculed Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s comments on the subject. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, campaigning in advance of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s June 7 primary, also gave the back of his hand to several of the vice president's recent drug proposals `` The question is, ` Why have n't these been done the past seven years?' Is n't the vice president in charge of this effort?'' he asked. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor also said it was `` proper and appropriate'' that <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> pledged his cooperation with any ethics committee probe into allegations of financial irregularities. Beyond that, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> offered no defense of the Democratic speaker, but he said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> should not try to exploit any difficulties <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> might face. `` This administration has very serious problems,'' he said. `` We've got a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> that's a laughing stock and we've got this <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> mess on our hands. At a news conference, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also said, `` I'm going to continue to insist on a full explanation from the administration about what's going on'' concerning <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. `` The vice president was asked a few weeks ago whether we are paying <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. He said, ` I ca n't confirm that or deny that.' He's not running for press spokesman of the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> He's supposed to be running for president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` Are there links with the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>? Who were the people that were involved in drug-running and profit-skimming? And who was it in this administration who thought that that made sense?'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> made his comments as fresh poll results showed him leading <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in advance of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> primary and running ahead of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the state as well. The <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Poll said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has the support of 53 percent of the state's voters compared to 40 percent for the vice president among those making a choice. The comment about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> came at a news conference during a day designed to depict the governor as a future-oriented leader. He visited a company-sponsored day care center, and aides later distributed a prepared statement calling for improved day care around the country. In a speech to <ORGANIZATION> Syntex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> employees, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> needs to redirect some research and development money away from the military and into civilian use. Responding to a question at the news conference, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> repeated his stance that he's unable to guarantee he wo n't raise taxes if he reaches the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, although he said that would be his last resort. He also declined to say whether he would sign a cigarette tax increase moving through the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>. ` They'll be working this out, and when the budget gets to conference we'll sit down and decide if we need additional revenue,'' he said.

 Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> on Thursday gave his `` Golden Fleece Award'' for May to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> `` for wasting $ 1.9 million on two unneeded helicopters.'' The <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> Democrat said in a prepared statement that <ORGANIZATION> NOAA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> circumvented budget processes to purchase the pair of Bell 212's, but now can not identify a specific program to justify them `` OAO got the rotors and the taxpayers got the shaft,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> NOAA </ORGANIZATION>'s office of public affairs said the agency had no immediate comment on the award. <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>, who makes the monthly award for `` ridiculous, ironic or wasteful'' spending, said the aircraft office originally justified the choppers as a way of improving safety in <ORGANIZATION> NOAA </ORGANIZATION>'s program in the Arctic He said that the aircraft operations office, which was established in 1983 to better manage <ORGANIZATION> NOAA </ORGANIZATION> aircraft use, `` neglected to mention to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that the -LRB- Arctic -RRB- program's funding was being phased down.'' He quoted an unidentified <ORGANIZATION> NOAA </ORGANIZATION> manager as saying it was highly uncertain that the program would even continue after 1988. `` As a result of these cuts, one of the helicopters logged only 40 hours of flying time last year,'' <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> said. `` I doubt that many of these hours were spent exploring the Arctic continental shelf, since the helicopter was kept at OAO headquarters in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> for the last 20 months.'' Only one new <ORGANIZATION> NOAA </ORGANIZATION> program, a porpoise survey in the eastern tropical <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>, will need helicopters, but the Bell 212's `` are n't suited for this project,'' according to the senator `` It would be easy to call this a fly-by-night scheme, but even that would overstate these helicopters' actual usefulness,'' <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> said. `` For a purchase that should never have seen the light, Northern or otherwise, <ORGANIZATION> OAO </ORGANIZATION> deserves this month's Fleece.''

 A leader of a black coalition said Thursday `` there is a price'' for Democratic presidential front-runner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to win black votes in November. A 28-page report released by the coalition called for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> `` stringent and comprehensive'' sanctions against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, recognition of the government of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and an end to aid to the South African-supported group <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION>. `` It is the strong feeling throughout the black American community that on the issues of foreign policy that the objectives, the recommendations of this report must be thoughtfully responded to in exchange for black support in November,'' <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, head of the anti-apartheid group <ORGANIZATION> TransAfrica </ORGANIZATION>, told reporters. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> can lose with our support, -LRB- but -RRB- they can not win without it,'' he said. `` So all those who turned out in the black community for the primary must turn out for <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> if he has any chance of the White House.

Throughout the long primary campaign, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has made few overtures to black voters in deference to the popularity of <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. In response to the report, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> released a statement that outlined his support for the primary concerns of the group. `` Apartheid is morally repugnant to all those who cherish freedom and human dignity. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has engaged in terrorist acts,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said.

 A fire broke out Thursday in the restaurant being built next to the Air and Space Museum, causing minor damage. The two-alarm fire, which started just before 3 p.m., sent heavy smoke into the air but did n't spread to the popular museum where countless irreplaceable exhibits of aviation and space history are on display. `` Seeing all that smoke coming out of it, it was a frightening sight,'' said <PERSON> Madeleine </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>. She said, however, the fire was n't as serious as it appeared and visitors to the museum were not disturbed. The $ 14.3 million restaurant, a two-story glass structure supported by white steel tubing, is scheduled to open in September. `` Apparently a spark from a welder's torch ignited some paper that was being used to line the windows,'' said <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Givs </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. No injuries were reported. <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> said the blaze caused little structural damage, although firefighters had to knock holes in the glass walls to vent the heavy smoke.

<TEXT>
 The military put its forces on high alert Thursday following several bombings, peasant marches and the seizure of the <ORGANIZATION> Mexican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> by leftist guerrillas. President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> but was reported by a <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> minister to be in control of the government. Clashes this week between the army and peasants demonstrating for land reform and nationalization of foreign oil companies have left 11 people dead and 26 injured, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. In the last three days guerrillas have blown up a bridge on one of the country's most important highways, dynamited an oil pipeline and a gas pipeline and destroyed an electricity transmission tower. The defense minister, Gen. <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Samudio </PERSON> <PERSON> Molina </PERSON>, said in a communique that he was putting the armed forces on top alert. He spoke a few hours after 40 leftist guerrillas wearing black hoods seized the <ORGANIZATION> Mexican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> to protest water and electricity shortages in lower-class areas of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>. The protesters said they belonged to the group M-19, whose military arm has been active since the 1970s. In <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement Thursday that the embassy takeover was peaceful and the protesters said they wanted `` to call attention to questions related to human rights.'' The protesters apparently were unarmed, it said. Three embassy officials and an undetermined number of Colombian employees were in the building, officials said. The protesters demanded to talk with <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s attorney general, <PERSON> Horacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Serpa </PERSON>, and the managers of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>'s departments of electric power and water. Water and electricity have been rationed in many areas of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> during the past two months as the capital goes through its worst drought in 53 years. The poor have been especially hard hit. Barco is being constantly informed of developments in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and is giving instructions to the minister of government, <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaviria </PERSON>, said the minister of communications, <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Cepeda </PERSON>, who was with the president in <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION>. He spoke in an interview on the Colombian radio network <ORGANIZATION> Caracol </ORGANIZATION>. In the western city of <LOCATION> Cali </LOCATION> assailants threw bombs Wednesday night at the seven-story Cosmocentro department store, causing $ 17 million in damage, police said. No one claimed responsibility. Ten more bombs were found outside other stores and were deactivated, the police said. Four bombs exploded in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, in northwest <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, causing slight damage to two banks, a government office and and recreation club, the police said in a communique. A fifth bomb was deactivated, the police said. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla group, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s most active rebel group, claimed responsibility for the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> bombings. In the central Colombian city of <LOCATION> Barrancabermeja </LOCATION>, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardona </PERSON>, leader of a petroleum workers' union, was slain Wednesday night, police said. No one claimed responsibility for the killing. Unionized workers at the refinery run by the state oil company <ORGANIZATION> Ecopetrol </ORGANIZATION> called a 48-hour strike to protest the slaying. Right-wing death squads have killed more than 800 people in the last three years, including union leaders, leftist political workers and people believed to be guerrilla sympathizers. Thousands of peasants took part in protest marches in half a dozen northern towns Thursday, said <PERSON> Caracol </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> radio station <ORGANIZATION> RCN </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> claims leftist guerrillas have organized the protest marches which began Monday. Nine peasants and two soldiers have been killed in gunfire during the marches, and 24 peasants and two soldiers have been wounded, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said. Broadcast and newspaper reports have said between 17,000 and 30,000 peasants have taken part in the demonstrations. The military wing of M-19, or the April 19 Movement, seized the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in 1980 and held 16 ambassadors hostage there for two months. It also stormed <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Palace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> in 1986. Ninety-five people, including 11 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> justices, were killed. The April 19 Movement takes its name from a 1970 presidential election which critics said was fraudulent.

<TEXT>
 Democratic presidential contender <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said Thursday that the upcoming superpower summit is a step in the right direction, but that other nations should be included in future meetings. `` When <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> meet in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, they represent 500 million people, one-eighth of the human race. Seven-eighths will be locked out of the meeting ... that has to change,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. Still, he said, holding the summit `` is the right thing to do _ to talk it out and not shoot it out. ... our future is to choose negotiation over confrontation, the human race over the arms race.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> made his remarks at a rally with about 1,000 students at racially mixed <ORGANIZATION> Independence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, 50 miles south of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. He was concluding a 10-day campaign tour of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, where polls suggest he is running far behind <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for the June 7 primary. In his campus rally, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he believed he was having an impact on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' views on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has been urging that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> be designated a terrorist state, and has been trying to bring <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> around to that view. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> says he would n't rule it out, but also says he believes economic sanctions would be a more effective first step. `` He is adjusting to a new agenda,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. He said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is following his lead on the matter, as well as on drug issues. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> again criticized the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration for `` the disgraceful practice of negotiating with drug dealers, which discredits our government and is beneath our dignity.'' He repeated his familiar anti-drug message to the students. `` I challenge you today. Let's stop drugs, crack, heroin, cocaine, PCP. Drugs are dream-busters. Drugs destroy your mind, your body, your character, your good judgment ... As president, I can stop the supply of drugs. You must stop the demand for drugs,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>General Says Soviets Had 100,300 Soldiers In Afghanistan</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> said Thursday it had 100,300 soldiers in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> when the withdrawal began May 15. It was the first count the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> had given in the eight years since it joined the Afghan civil war. The number provided by Marshal <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Akhromeyev </PERSON>, chief of the general staff and a first deputy defense minister, was nearly 15,000 below Western intelligence estimates. Soviet military forces entered <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979, replaced one Communist government with another and stayed to fight Moslem guerrillas. <PERSON> Akhromeyev </PERSON> gave the figure at a news conference the day after Gen. <PERSON> Alexei </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lizichev </PERSON>, another ranking <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official, provided the first Soviet casualty count: 13,310 soldiers killed, 35,478 wounded and 311 missing. <PERSON> Lizichev </PERSON> had refused to reveal the size of the Soviet force. Western diplomats in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, said Thursday large Soviet convoys were moving at night in northern <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in an effort to speed the withdrawal. They said a major movement from <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> north through the <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> pass began early Wednesday and continued Thursday, but they did not have the number of soldiers involved. Night travel is unusual and risky, particularly in the <LOCATION> Shomali </LOCATION> area just north of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, where reports indicated heavy fighting recently, the diplomats said. The reports said guerrillas had taken <LOCATION> Qarabagh </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bagram </LOCATION>, towns about 30 miles north of the capital. The diplomats in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, all of whom spoke on condition of anonymity, said they had no indications from <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> that rebel pressure had impeded Soviet withdrawal. When journalists at the news conference asked Gen. <PERSON> Akhromeyev </PERSON> for the number of soldiers, he replied: `` The contingent in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> as of May 15 numbered 100,300.'' He said 9,500 soldiers had left since the withdrawal began. Reports have said about 20,000 would be out by Sunday, when the U.S.-Soviet summit begins in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Under the agreement signed April 14 in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, half the force is to be withdrawn by Aug. 15 and all Soviet soldiers must be gone within nine months. Earlier this week, reports from <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> quoted diplomats as saying only two Soviet units totaling about 3,000 soldiers had left since May 15. <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> mediator who arranged the accord, said Thursday in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> the agreement is `` slowly falling into place'' and `` we have a feeling that the implementation has started on the whole in an effective manner.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday designated scores of additional counties, generally in farther-out suburban areas, that must be considered part of urban areas failing to meet clean air standards. If the counties eventually are included in new air pollution control plans the agency is requiring, it could mean tighter controls on their industries and possibly auto pollution inspections if not already in force. The designation was made in formal notices to 44 state governors and the mayor of the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. The agency said it was disapproving air pollution control plans, or revoking previous approval, for cities and a handful of rural areas that do not meet air quality standards. The notices said the additional counties must be considered in new plans. States are being given 60 days to submit schedules on which they will draw up new plans, which can take two years; to fulfill promises in old plans; to begin new assessments of actual pollution as opposed to computer estimates; and to add monitors where <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> says they're needed. The ozone non-compliance areas gained 125 counties and the carbon monoxide areas gained 115. Only <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> do not have non-complying areas and thus are not getting Thursday's letter. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> announced on May 2 that 68 areas fail to meet ozone standards and 59 do not meet carbon monoxide standards, based on 1985-1987 data. It had warned last November that it would enlarge planning areas, but the decision just where the expansions would come was made during the last two months generally based on census and other economic data. The failure of the nation's cities to meet clean air goals has frustrated politicians and policymakers alike for at least a decade, and there has been no agreement on what to do about it. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last December barred the agency from imposing sanctions until Aug. 31 for failure to draw up acceptable control plans. Thus it shelved <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> plans to forbid the construction of major new sources of pollution in 14 areas where it considered control plans inadequate. It also told <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> to accelerate its annual designation of non-complying areas this year. In the meantime, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is considering a wide range of changes to the Clean Air Act, including provisions to deal with the failure of the 68 and 59 areas to meet the Dec. 31, 1987, deadline for attaining the air quality standards. Most provisions would award more time and require new anti-pollution steps. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> told a news conference he was doing nothing that would pre-empt congressional action, and `` Clearly what I'm doing is not sufficient to deal with the problem.'' If <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> fails to act, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said that in the fall he would begin to carry out a strategy he outlined last November to require new control measures against carbon monoxide and the precursors of ozone. Some measures are in the pipeline already, such as draft regulations to control gasoline evaporation, which helps form ozone.

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> canceled one of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s summit sessions next week with General Secretary <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and objected to the makeup of a religious delegation scheduled to see <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, White House officials said Thursday. Presidential spokesmen sought to minimize the last-minute glitches, which developed as <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and his wife <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> attempted to overcome jet lag and rest up for the start of the summit in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Sunday. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> neared pre-summit approval of the historic treaty eliminating intermediate-range nuclear missiles that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> signed at their <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> summit in December. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted overwhelmingly to restrict a future president's power to change the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interpretation of the treaty, settling the last major issue before floor action on the document. <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> <PERSON> Popadiuk </PERSON>, a White House spokesman, said the decision to scrub one of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s five face-to-face meetings with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was `` mutual.'' However, chief spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> had said earlier that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials were seeking an explanation. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, talking to reporters in this Finnish capital Thursday, said, `` I regard it as routine.'' A second Reagan-Gorbachev meeting scheduled for next Monday was canceled by the Soviets for what the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> cited as `` some internal function.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the Soviets had `` a scheduling problem'' with one of the Reagan-Gorbachev sessions, in particular one set for Monday afternoon. `` They needed the time for some internal function,'' he said, and his office later issued a statement saying the meeting had been canceled by `` mutual decision.'' There was no indication whether the cancellation was related in any way to a <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> conference, the first of its kind since 1941, that is scheduled to open in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> after the summit. Another problem developed when word reached the presidential party that the Soviets had questioned the participation of one of the religious groups scheduled to meet with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> at the <PERSON> Danilov </PERSON> monastery on Monday. `` The meeting itself is still on as far as I know,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. He said he did not know which religious group the Soviets objected to. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also plans to meet separately with a group of Jewish `` refuseniks'' who had been unable to obtain exit permits for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said he was unable to verify a complaint that two persons had been intercepted by Soviet authorities on their way to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>. A White House official, speaking on condition he not be identified by name, said the administration had been assured that `` everyone that's been invited will attend'' the Monday afternoon session. On the official level, the Soviets have shown no concern over the meeting planned between <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet refuseniks. At a press conference to discuss the forthcoming summit, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> affairs expert <PERSON> Georgy </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Arbatov </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Shishlin </PERSON> both stated that they considered <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s meeting partners his own business But Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrovsky </PERSON> said, `` This American move is hardly aimed at improving mutual understanding between the <LOCATION> U.S.A. </LOCATION> and U.S.S.R.'' As far as the planned <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> meeting with `` refuseniks'' and `` dissidents'' is concerned, <PERSON> Petrovsky </PERSON> said, it `` looks in a different light, since the point at issue is an obviously tendentious selection of the participants.'' <PERSON> Petrovsky </PERSON> said `` the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> president, who will be our guest in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, is certainly free to decide who of Soviet citizens he finds interesting and useful to meet with outside the framework of the official events.'' Dozens of refuseniks demonstrating in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Thursday said they want human rights to figure prominently in the Reagan-Gorbachev meetings. A <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> refusenik said in a telephone interview that <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> secret police has warned him against accepting an invitation to meet <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Monday. <PERSON> Roald </PERSON> `` <PERSON> Alec </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Zelichonok </PERSON>, who has been refused permission to emigrate for more than 10 years, said he received a letter and telephone call Tuesday from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> inviting him to take part in the meeting with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. Shortly after the embassy phone call, he said, a <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> officer telephoned. `` This officer called and said in light of security measures around <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, my departure for <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> will not be permitted,'' <PERSON> Zelichonok </PERSON> said by telephone from his <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> home. <PERSON> Zelichonok </PERSON>, 51, said the officer warned him that if he traveled to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, `` administrative measures'' carrying possible penalties of detention, house arrest or up to 15 days in jail would be taken against him. Despite the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s efforts to smooth over any differences, the schedule change and rumors that the Soviets were attempting to restrict access to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> contributed a measure of uncertainty to his fourth summit meeting with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. The pre-summit jockeying came as the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> remained in seclusion at an official Finnish guesthouse here _ a plush retreat furnished with an indoor sauna and pool and located in a wooded residential area. In a private, waterside park near the guesthouse, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s first couple took a 30-minute stroll, `` greeted local citizens'' and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> threw stones across the water, a White House statement said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> delivers a pre-summit address on human rights here Friday, and rests again Saturday before leaving Sunday for the five-day <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit. As he awaited word from the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on ratification of the treaty banning medium-range missiles, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s top arms negotiator, <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Kampelman </PERSON>, expressed confidence that the superpowers would dispense with some knotty problems on a more far-reaching pact aimed at halving their arsenals of strategic missiles. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also met briefly with his senior advisers to go over the final details of the summit schedule _ omitting the second Monday meeting and lengthening the times of other meetings, the White House statement said. Overall, the president still will spend six hours with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, because the remaining sessions will be expanded, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is going over a 3-inch briefing book and, six months after he started, has finished <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s book `` Perestroika,'' on his plans to revitalize his country's troubled economy. The advisers who huddled with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> were not identified, but it appeared most White House officials attempted to follow <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s laid-back approach by enjoying <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>'s light breezes and bright northern sun <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> refused to hold a formal press briefing and tried to flee reporters who peppered him with questions as he exited his hotel. Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and the president's top arms control advisers _ <PERSON> Kampelman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowney </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Nitze </PERSON> _ were spotted taking a cruise about the city's harbor. Unless the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> acts in time to rush the INF treaty to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for the formal exchange of ratification documents in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, the summit has no expectation of major results. In an interview Tuesday with a group of West European jouralists, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> left open the possibility of a fifth summit with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> before he leaves office in January _ if negotiators can complete the treaty to reduce long-range nuclear missiles. `` I wo n't rule it out,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in a text released on Thursday. `` I wo n't say it's impossible ... I would hope that we can iron out the still undecided points before I leave..

<HEAD>Foreign Nurses Get One-Year Visa Extension</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 In a stopgap measure to deal with a domestic nursing shortage, the federal government on Thursday granted a blanket one-year visa extension for thousands of foreign nurses working in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The Immigration and <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> acted following an appeal last Friday by 42 members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that it grant an extension. In addition to granting a blanket extension _ coverting five-year visas to six-year visas for foreign nurses _ <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said agency district director `` will have discretionary authority to grant additional time on a case-by-case basis.'' Guidelines for exercising the discretionary authority are being developed, <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said in a statement. Meanwhile, he urged hospitals to redouble their efforts to recruit and retain <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nurses and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to seek a long-term solution to a domestic nursing shortage that administrators say makes it essential for them to employ foreign-born nurses. Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, one of the lawmakers who urged the extension, called the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> response `` an act of compassion.'' `` There is a desperate shortage of nurses in many parts of the country,'' <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON> said. `` Even though we all agree that additional steps must be taken to expand training programs for more American nurses and improve their pay, we can not afford to wait at this point.'' <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON> pledged to work for legislation to attack the problem. `` The extension does n't solve the nation's nursing shortage, but it does buy time,'' he said. About 2,000 foreign nurses, 18 percent of the total recruited by American hospitals, would have been sent home this year had the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> not extended their visas. Most work in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. An estimated 300,000 nursing jobs are unfilled nationwide _ a vacancy rate that ranges from 10 percent to 20 percent in various cities. The call for visa extensions was backed by nurses unions as a temporary measure while more American nurses can be recruited and trained. Union leaders say the profession demands more status and higher pay _ especially for nurses with long-term experience, who tend to quit because of burnout and lack of incentives. But they say it will take time to accomplish those changes and that foreign nurses are needed in the meantime. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Raske </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Greater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said the visa extension `` averted a potential public health crisis in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'' were an estimated 4,000 foreign nurses work and about one-fifth faced deportation this year. Officials in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> estimated about 200 of the 918 foreign nurses working there would have been subject to deportation this year without the extension.

 Neighbors fed up with drug users and prostitutes using a nearby house followed up trashing the place by torching it, police said. About 25 residents on the city's southwest side stormed the house Tuesday night and routed the occupants with baseball bats and pipes, engaging some occupants in fist fights. Thursday morning, the house was set on fire, and authorities suspect the people simply finished the job they started. `` Get Out Now,'' and `` Move'' were spray painted on the front door when the house was ransacked. `` Sure it was a lynch mob,'' one resident said. `` But what are you going to do? We have to be vigilantes.'' Police, who learned of the row only after it ended, said no arrests were made. The fire, in which no one was hurt, likely will go unprosecuted too, police said. Some neighbors said the incidents resulted from years of frustration that had built up in the once tidy, ethnic neighborhood of mostly Polish, Lithuanian and Ukrainian families. `` The neighborhood has changed gradually over the past 20 years, but in the last five years it has accelerated,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Vassallo </PERSON>, a senior social planner and developer for the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Training </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> who has lived in the neighborhood 55 years. `` There are dope houses, car thefts, prostitutes, you name it. I really hate to see the neighborhood go down like this.'' Neighborhood residents said they had asked for police help numerous times, but authorities said they had no record of requests, except for a narcotics complaint late last year. `` You ca n't take the law into your own hands,'' 4th Precinct Cmdr. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> McKane </PERSON> said. `` I do n't care how frustrating your problem is.''

 President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said Thursday his <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is the best hope for ending the nation's deep racial divisions, which critics say the party created in 40 years of unbroken rule. Two bombs exploded at lunchtime on busy streets of <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>, wounding four white women, one of whom lost an arm. Law and Order Minister <PERSON> Adriaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> blamed the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the main guerrilla group fighting white domination. In a speech marking the 40th anniversary of <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> power, <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said the party is pursuing gradual reforms that have broadened democracy while guarding against revolution. His Nationalists are best known for the apartheid policy, which has formalized and strengthened racial segregation since they gained power in the election of May 26, 1948. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> has pursued limited reform since taking charge in 1978 but his party's objective remains the preservation of political and economic control for the 5 million whites. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s 26 million blacks have no voice in national affairs. On Thursday, <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> will never allow militant anti-apartheid groups to take power `` because we do n't want a dictatorship that restricts the freedom of people. He conceded some mistakes by the party during four decades in power, but did not name them and said, `` We did much more right than we did wrong.'' `` We will succeed just as we succeeded in the past when we brought great things into being in this country,'' he told his audience in <LOCATION> Parow </LOCATION>, just outside <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>. The bombs exploded within five minutes and two blocks of each other on busy street corners of the capital. The four women injured were librarians in their 30s returning to work from lunch, police and witnesses said. Spokesmen at the <ORGANIZATION> H.F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Verwoerd </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> said all the injuries were caused by the second bomb. In addition to the woman whose arm was blown off, they reported two had extensive facial burns and the fourth suffered back injuries. About five minutes earlier, a bomb destroyed a parked car but caused no injuries. `` These cowardly and unscrupulous deeds are characteristic of the desperate attempts being waged by the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> to practice terrorism,'' <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> military commander, <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Modise </PERSON>, said: `` Basically, we do have men with bombs, and no one else carries out this type of operation inside the country.'' <PERSON> Modise </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unity </ORGANIZATION> summit. More than 70 bombs have exploded in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> since a state of emergency was declared June 12, 1986, to thwart an uprising in black townships. In a signed article recently in The Sunday Star of <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> reflected on how the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has shaped <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> over four decades. `` Human resources are a country's most valuable asset,'' he wrote. `` That is why, since coming into power, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has pursued a policy which offers all the Republic of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s inhabitants maximal quality of life and development opportunities.'' Pro-government papers praised the party this week and said it is best qualified to resolve racial problems. `` The troubles we have had in the last two or three years are nothing compared with the troubles we would have if the government had not started to dismantle apartheid,'' The Citizen said in an editorial Tuesday. An editorial in The Star held the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> largely responsible for the nation's problems and said it had not offered solutions. `` Triumphant the government may feel, yet it is threatened by a mounting white backlash on its right and a mighty tide of anger from black <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and the outside world on its left,'' The <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. At its founding in 1914, the party was intended as a vehicle for promoting the interests of Afrikaners, descendants of the Dutch, French and German settlers who arrived in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in the 17th century. After losing to the British in the Boer War of 1899-1902, many Afrikaners felt dominated culturally and politically by English-speakers, who generally were richer and better educated. Afrikaners now make up 60 percent of the white population and their economic and educational levels are comparable to those of English-speaking <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africans </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s policy of limited reform has induced many English-speaking South Africans to support the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, but even more pro-apartheid Afrikaners have joined the far-right <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which emerged from the 1987 white election as the main opposition in Parliament.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats held high-level consultations with <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> democracies Thursday in search of new ways for encouraging military leader <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to leave <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said. Hours after the collapse Wednesday of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiating effort, Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said, ambassadors in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> capitals were ordered to meet with host-country presidents and foreign ministers on Thursday to discuss the issue. The envoys were asked to tell these governments `` what happened in detail and to ask for their advice in helping us move forward,'' <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> told reporters after testifying before a closed-door hearing of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Foreign Relations Committee. Appearing on the `` MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour'' Thursday night, Undersecretary of State <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Armacost </PERSON> indicated that the Central American democracies will play an increasingly active role in mediating a settlement in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. `` I think it's an excellent idea,'' <PERSON> Armacost </PERSON> said, noting that several Central American countries `` have a tremendous storehouse of experience in the transition to civilian democratic rule.'' Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> announced Wednesday the failure of the negotiation, which was aimed at inducing <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to resign as commander of the Panamanian <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> and go into exile. As part of the proposed deal, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug-smuggling indictments against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> would have been dropped. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s de facto ruler, rejected the proposal and <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said no further negotiations were planned. With <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> at his side, Sen. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Conn </LOCATION>., expressed regret over the setback, but many others in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> seemed pleased at the outcome Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON>, D-Mass., said, `` A lot of people are not upset that it fell apart. <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> said the negotiations hurt <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign policy `` and also sent a terrible message with respect to our ability to do something about the narcotics traffic.'' Panamanian Ambassador <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON>, who is allied with forces opposed to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, said `` the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should hold back and let other initiatives go forward.'' <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration negotiated in good faith but should not have dealt with a terrorist. `` The problem is <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is not an honorable person,'' he said. Later, <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON> conferred with <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials on the possibility of a Central American diplomatic effort to resolve the crisis. He said diplomatic contacts have been made since Wednesday with Guatemalan President <PERSON> Vinicio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cerezo </PERSON>, who is expected to play a lead role in any mediation effort by the four Central American democracies. The three others are <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. The administration has resisted significant involvement in the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> issue by other hemispheric governments, but has now shifted its strategy somewhat after calling a halt to its own initiative. Although <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has little overt support in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, hemispheric nations have indicated deep reservations about the administration's approach to the problem. One example of this was a meeting of 26 Latin American countries two months ago at which a resolution was passed criticizing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic sanctions against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. In the aftermath of the negotiating failure, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said they attributed the setback to one or a combination of reasons. The officials, who insisted on anonymity, said it was possible that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had no intention of a serious negotiation from the beginning and was stringing the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> along. Another possible explanation, they said, was that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s allies in the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> vetoed the proposed deal on the grounds that the arrangement offered them no guarantees that they would not be punished by a successor government for their association with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> Finally, the officials said, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> may have been negotiating in good faith all along but when the moment came for a decision, he was unable to agree to a package that would cost him his job and send him into temporary exile.

 Convinced that another oil crisis lies down the road, a group of environmentalists, oil companies and state governors Thursday announced a new attempt to forge solutions before problems crop up. The Denver-based group, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, said its members hope to stage a 48-hour simulated oil crisis in the third week of November, with 100 participants, and persuade one of the television networks to make an hour-long program out of it. `` Polls indicate that national leaders and the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> public are convinced there will be another energy crisis,'' said one of the organizers, Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinner </PERSON> of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>. But, he added, `` Energy policy has fallen off the national agenda,'' especially since crude oil plunged from $ 28 a barrel to less than $ 10 in 1986. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Ebinger </PERSON>, a staff member at the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> and an energy consultant, said, `` The purpose of the game is to convince everyone that on the basis of the current impasse, that no one is going to win their agenda. `` Environmentalists may see their interests run roughshod over in another crisis and oil and gas companies may have to accept price controls again, which is n't in their interests either,'' <PERSON> Ebinger </PERSON> said. The rules of the game have not been decided upon. When it is over, organizers of the group hope to get conflicting interests to start serious bargaining on a few unspecified topics where agreement might be possible. Crude prices have recovered to about $ 18, but are still considered low in the oil patch. Asked why an oil crisis was likely, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Beatty </PERSON>, senior vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Coastal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a Houston-based oil and gas producer, said, `` Low prices are stimulating consumption and rapidly expanding demand for cheap overseas oil.'' Crude and product imports now account for 39 percent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consumption, up from 34 percent this time last year. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>, president of the group, said it will try `` to grapple with conflicting solutions,'' such as the conservation-at-any-price vision backed by some environmental organizations and the expand-production-everywhere solution of some oil companies. `` We are working together with people whose views we vehemently disagree with,'' <PERSON> Beatty </PERSON> said. The group includes consevation advocate <PERSON> Amory </PERSON> <PERSON> Lovins </PERSON> and a consuming-state governor, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 A senator Thursday accused the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s civil rights chief, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>, of lying to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and of rejecting the advice of subordinates who called for an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> probe of a <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> voter registration challenge in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>. At a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> hearing, Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, disclosed memos by civil rights division subordinates urging that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigate possible criminal violations of the Voting Rights Act in connection with a <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> voter registration challenge aimed at predominantly black precincts in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> in 1986. In March 1987, <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> told the committee that it was the conclusion of `` everybody who looked at the matter'' from the division's voting section that `` there was no ... violation of the Voting Rights Act that would allow us to go in and prosecute.'' `` You misstated the facts; you lied to the committee,'' <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> at a <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> hearing Thursday. `` You state things in half-truths,'' responded Reynolds. `` What kind of half-truths, what kind of half-truths?'' yelled <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>. <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> said that another part of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, the criminal division, was consulted on the matter and concluded that no criminal investigation was warranted. <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> and a deputy, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, insisted that subordinates in the civil rights division ended up agreeing that no <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> probe was warranted. Since the case involved the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, `` I wanted to be darn sure I was n't going to do something they would question us about later,'' said <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>. <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> released an Oct. 7, 1986, memo by <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> <PERSON> Wertz </PERSON>, an attorney in the voting section, urging the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s entry into the matter. The senator also released another Oct. 7 memo _ this one to <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> from <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, chief of the voting section _ which called for discussions on the appropriateness of having the criminal section coordinate the investigation. In addition, civil rights division investigators wrote a three-page document that would have been sent by <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> to the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> director detailing the proposed scope of a criminal probe. Attached to the three-page document was a note from <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Turner </LOCATION> saying, `` As indicated in the earlier briefing papers we sent to <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> re the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> voter challenge matter, here is the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> request we propose to send out.'' But at the bottom of <PERSON> Wertz </PERSON>' memo, <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> said in a handwritten note: `` There is under the circumstances no legitimate reason to initiate an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigation of the La. activities.'' The note said that a state court injunction had brought the voter challenge activity to a halt, that no voters were denied registration rights and that there was `` no real prospect'' they would be. `` On the other hand, there appears to be a concern of possible harassment, fraud and intimidation of blacks in the upcoming election,'' said <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>' note. `` To the extent such behavior is found we may well want to initiate an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigation after the Nov. 4 elections.'' No such probe was ever launched. After the hearing, <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>' aides said they had provided <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> with additional documents on the proposed <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> probe. None of the additional documents, however, touched on any involvement by the criminal division in recommending against a probe, said aides to <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>. <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> is counselor to Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> as well as assistant attorney general in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s civil rights division.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> said it will send in soldiers Friday to end a 3-week-old bloodbath between rival Shiite Moslem armies in the slums of south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Hours later, assassins tried to kill <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s four top generals here. The ambush failed, the Syrians reported, and the generals escaped harm. Among the targets was Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Ghazi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenaan </PERSON>, the officer who earlier Thursday announced a truce in the south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> fighting and disclosed <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> plans to deploy its soldiers there. The generals' car was riddled with dozens of machine-gun bullets Thursday night, but none of the officers or bodyguards was hit, said Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Saeed </PERSON> <PERSON> Bairakdar </PERSON>, commander of <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s forces in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and a survivor of the ambush. <PERSON> Kenaan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s military intelligence chief in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, told reporters in the Lebanese capital upon his return from <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, `` Rest assured the slums war is over.'' A Syrian official told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> ending the slaughter will mean new hope for 18 foreign hostages, most of whom are believed held in the embattled enclave. He pledged that <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> will do its utmost to gain freedom for the captives, including nine Americans. Fighting in south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> dwindled to sporadic sniper fire exchanges Thursday after the cease-fire was announced. No casualties were reported. But at 9:10 p.m. -LRB- 3:10 p.m. EDT -RRB- gunmen opened up on the generals' five-car convoy as it drove through <PERSON> Ghobeiry </PERSON>, one of the embattled districts of south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bairakdar </PERSON> told reporters after arriving in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. He said the four officers were in <PERSON> Kenaan </PERSON>'s bullet-proof Mercedes 500 when it was hit with dozens of bullets `` and the gas tank was holed,'' forcing the generals to abandon the car and drive away in one of the others in the convoy. The other officers were Brig. <PERSON> Gens </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammoud </PERSON>, intelligence chief for the <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> area, and <PERSON> Zuheir </PERSON> <PERSON> Musattati </PERSON>, a deputy to <LOCATION> Bairakdar </LOCATION>. They were driving back from a meeting with <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Fadlallah </PERSON>, the spiritual guide of the Iranian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, when attacked, he said. It was not clear who the assailants were. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> controls most of the territory there. In south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> warplanes and helicopter gunships blasted <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> guerrilla bases and positions of <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> in two separate raids. Twelve combatants were reported killed and four wounded in the assaults, the first of which took place during the night and the second at 8 a.m. -LRB- 2 a.m. EDT -RRB- Thursday. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, is a group of <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> fundamentalists believed to be an umbrella for smaller organizations holding the foreign hostages. It is <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s main proxy force in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> and the Syrian-backed Amal militia have been locked in a bloody fight for control of the 16-square-mile south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> enclave since May 6. Police said the fighting killed 296 people and wounded 1,000. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> gained control of more than 90 percent of the slums during the struggle. On Thursday, <PERSON> Kenaan </PERSON> announced, `` Zero hour has been set. The Syrian deployment will begin tomorrow -LRB- Friday -RRB-.'' He refused to disclose the exact time of the deployment, but said <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> forces will set up buffer zones to disengage the combatants and patrol the suburbs to `` establish security.'' <PERSON> Kenaan </PERSON> said the warring factions will be allowed to operate `` only political and information offices,'' indicating that the militiamen will have to lay down arms. As he spoke, <PERSON> Kenaan </PERSON> was flanked by <PERSON> Bairakdar </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hammoud </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> is the main power broker in neighboring <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, which has been wracked by civil war for 13 years. The three generals conferred with Shiite religious leaders and politicians before <PERSON> Kenaan </PERSON>'s declaration. In <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, a Syrian government official said a cease-fire accord was worked out late Wednesday in a meeting between Syrian President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> and a <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> delegation in <LOCATION> Latakia </LOCATION>, northern <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>. `` Ending the fighting will create new hope for the hostages and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> will spare no effort to secure their release, regardless of their nationality,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. He told <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> correspondent <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Ludington </PERSON> that the accord has been approved by all parties concerned, including <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. It was not clear if the hostages were part of the deal. But <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s acting foreign minister, <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Besharati </PERSON>, predicted last week that the hostage problem would be solved after peace was restored in south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> has had thousands of troops ringing the slums for days, but a Syrian source in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> said <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> never believed it was possible to obtain release of the hostages by force. The source, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said the first priority was to preserve the hostages' lives _ `` then there can be hope for their release through negotiations.'' <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> correspondent for the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION>, is the longest held hostage. He was captured on March 16, 1985.

 <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, both targets of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic sanctions, were elected to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday in what was seen as a slap at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policies in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> also was elected. Western diplomats said the election of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, which has been accused by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of widespread human rights violations, had been expected because of its strong standing in the non-aligned movement. <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> replaces <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and is expected to vote in generally the same way. The secret-ballot vote for <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, however, appeared to be a strong sympathy vote for that government and a show of anger over <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sanctions and failed efforts to oust its de facto leader, Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is under indictment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on drug trafficking charges. The losers were <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, whose president, <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>, won the Nobel Peace Prize last year for his Central American peace plan, and <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> defeated <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> in a runoff ballot. <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> was elected unopposed as one of the African representatives in another regional vote. Ethiopian authorities have blocked food relief for famine-stricken regions in an effort to prevent it from reaching rebels. The three Latin American nations were seated for three-year terms on the major <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> human rights organization. They were elected by the 54-member Economic and <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, the parent body. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s ambassador, <PERSON> Leonardo </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamm </PERSON>, said the vote was a victorious `` message from the people of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to those conspiring to isolate our nation diplomatically. The votes cast for us demonstrate the political role my country continues to play in the international arena.'' Cuban Ambassador <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Oramas </PERSON> <PERSON> Oliva </PERSON> said the vote showed that his country had international support despite efforts by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials `` dedicated to a campaign of provocation and lies'' who sought to condemn <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> for purported human rights abuses. `` This is a victory for truth, reason and the people,'' he said, adding that <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> was committed to preserving human rights. <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> was elected on the first ballot, winning 38 votes _ 10 more than the required 28. <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> received 46 votes and <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> 31. The election was to fill three Latin American seats on the 43-member commission, which represents regional groups. The <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> is the major <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> organization working to promote and protect human rights. It meets for six weeks each year in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, the country's first black network television anchor, knows that people think his recent life-threatening illness might be AIDS, but he refuses to discuss it. `` I take the position that my health is a private matter,'' he told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> in an interview at his home in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. The Post, in a three-page profile of <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> published Thursday, noted that `` it is widely rumored that <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> has AIDS, and he's aware of that.'' `` The curiosity has at times annoyed me,'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said. `` I'm just not going to get into the subject of what I have. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, whose TV career took off when he became an anchorman in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in 1969, moved to the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> network in 1978 when he, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> and <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> were the three anchors on `` World News Tonight.''

When he was released nearly two months later, officials refused to discuss his illness. `` While in intensive care, he lay in an isolated room, and when he was moved to another ward, a warning was posted outside his room to medical personnel to gown and glove before performing certain tasks in caring for him,'' the newspaper said. `` I feel pretty good,'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said.

 They operate in the shadow of world leaders, these witnesses to history who work mostly in anonymity while greasing the skids of international diplomacy. They are the interpreters at superpower summits, and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> could not converse without them. For the summit in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> next week, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Obst </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Language Unit, is sending eight interpreters, who do oral translations, and four translators for written work. `` Language support is the most crucial element of the whole operation,'' says <PERSON> Obst </PERSON>, whose unit employs 50 interpreters and translators, with another 1,800 linguists on contract to supply the government with services in 60 to 70 languages. Turning Russian into English and vice versa is not their only role. As witnesses to the tete-a-tetes between <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, the interpreters take notes that constitute the only record of conversations that could determine the fate of nations. It's not enough to know one or more foreign languages. Quick wits and a broad general knowledge are essential. For instance, the interpreter assigned to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, Czech-born <PERSON> Dimitry </PERSON> <PERSON> Zarechnak </PERSON>, has one degree in mathematics, another in Russian literature. <PERSON> Zarechnak </PERSON>, 44, became the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s senior <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> interpreter in 1982 and attended the three previous Reagan-Gorbachev summits Interpreters must have great powers of concentration because they ca n't very well turn to a president and ask him to repeat his remarks. And being in shape is important. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Krimer </PERSON>, who until his retirement in 1982 was the country's top <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> interpreter, recalls being stuck in a motorcade several cars away from his principal. The motorcade stopped, <PERSON> Krimer </PERSON> ran up to offer his services, and as he finished, the cars began to move. Running back to his car, <PERSON> Krimer </PERSON> saw that he would n't make it. `` I opened the door of the nearest car to me, jumped in and landed in the lap of the joint chiefs,'' he said in an interview last year. That was not the only embarrassment <PERSON> Krimer </PERSON> endured. After just a few months on the job, <PERSON> Krimer </PERSON> was called to interpret at an arms control briefing. He kept careful notes of the Russian general's comments, and then sprang into action _ reading his notes back in Russian When he realized what he was doing and stoppd, he said, the director of the <ORGANIZATION> Arms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disarmament </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> smiled and told the Russians: `` Well gentlemen, at least you see you're getting an accurate rendition of the speech.'' Not all mistakes are so benign. An interpreter made President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> look a bit foolish in front of his hosts on a 1977 trip to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. When the president spoke about the Poles' `` desires for the future,'' interpreter <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON>'s rendition in Polish was `` your lusts for the future.'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s `` when I left the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>'' was translated into `` when I abandoned the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' When former Chinese Vice Premier <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiao-ping </PERSON> visited the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1979, he was presented with a 10-gallon hat in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The diminutive visitor, realizing the hat was way too big for him, handed the hat to his interpreter <PERSON> Ji </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaozhu </PERSON>, who dwarfed <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> by as much as a full foot. <PERSON> Ji </PERSON> was helpful in other ways. When a questioner tried to ask the vice premier about the delicate issue of a possible <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> invasion of <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, the interpreter jumped in, saying <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> had answered the question previously. His action reflected the fact that both the Chinese and Soviet chief interpreters are more than wordsmiths. <PERSON> Oleg </PERSON> <PERSON> Troyanovsky </PERSON>, for example, was the interpreter for the late Soviet leader <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> and later became Soviet ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> Sukhodrev </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s personal interpreter, also has a top foreign ministry post in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sukhodrev </PERSON> is a virtual legend on the summit circuit. Former Secretary of State <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> describes <PERSON> Sukhodrev </PERSON> in his book `` The White House Years'' as `` splendid'' and `` unflappable.'' <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> recalls only one time when <PERSON> Sukhodrev </PERSON> was stumped. Former President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> suggested at the 1972 <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit that certain <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet actions in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> were preparatory to `` the nut-cutting stage.'' <PERSON> Sukhodrev </PERSON> interpreted the phrase literally as `` cutting the fruit from a tree,'' <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> wrote, `` to the obvious mystification'' of everyone. <PERSON> Sukhodrev </PERSON> will probably be aided at the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit by <PERSON> Pavel </PERSON> <PERSON> Palazchenko </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Uspenskiy </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Obst </PERSON>. <PERSON> Zarechnak </PERSON> will be assisted by <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> and <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Afanasenko </PERSON>.

 Police said Thursday they had no information about a Belgian physician missing since the weekend, but Palestinian sources said Dr. <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cools </PERSON> was kidnapped in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The Popular Committee, which runs daily affairs at <LOCATION> Rashidiyeh </LOCATION>, a Palestinian refugee camp, said in a statement that Cools was abducted near the ancient port of Tyre by gunmen. It said Cools, 32, left his base at the <LOCATION> Rashidiyeh </LOCATION> camp Saturday in a taxi headed for Tyre, two miles to the north, and was `` abducted at a road junction leading to <LOCATION> Qana </LOCATION>,'' about midway. It gave no further details. His Norwegian employers, a relief group called <PERSON> Norwac </PERSON>, said the Cools left <LOCATION> Rashidiyeh </LOCATION> at 2 p.m. Saturday. Amal, the mainstream Shiite Moslem militia, seized control of Tyre and other sectors of south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in April after crushing the pro-Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> in the area. A statement from <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> said it was `` investigating the Belgian doctor's case'' and `` parties carrying out their own plots in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'' may have kidnapped him. It did not elaborate. Eighteen foreigners are missing, and most are believed to be captives of Shiite extremists linked to <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>. Held the longest is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, who was seized March 16, 1985.

 A <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officer who defeated fraternization charges brought against her because of her relationship with a <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> enlisted man said Thursday she loves the service and hopes her case will change military policy. `` I love my husband. I love the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, and I do n't see why the two are not compatible,'' Lt. <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazure </PERSON>, 29, told reporters at a news conference a day after a <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> general dropped the charges. Ms. <PERSON> Mazure </PERSON>, a dentist assigned to the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ground </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Combat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Twentynine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palms </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, was accompanied by her husband, former <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> <PERSON> Cpl </PERSON>. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON>, and her parents, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazure </PERSON>. `` I hope that from out of this the fraternization policy will become more defined, so that people wo n't have to go through what I had to, because it is very ill-defined,'' she said. Ms. <PERSON> Mazure </PERSON>, formerly of <LOCATION> Mercer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, was cleared of all charges after Tuesday's 4 -LCB- - hour hearing before Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Deegan </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenbaum </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> lawyer `` I'm very proud of my wife for holding up so well,'' said Price, 24, of <LOCATION> Eden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, who married her Nov. 28 and left the <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION> after the charges were brought. The charges brought Nov. 25 marked `` the first time in the history of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> ... that charges of fraternization have been brought against an officer for conduct with a member of another branch of the service,'' <PERSON> Rosenbaum </PERSON> said. He emphasized that Ms. <PERSON> Mazure </PERSON> and her husband were not in the same chain of command. On Jan. 11, a hearing was held to determine whether she should be court-martialed and on Jan. 19 the hearing officer recommended there should be no court-martial, <PERSON> Rosenbaum </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Deegan </PERSON> overruled the recommendation and on Feb. 16 the case was referred to a court-martial. On Monday the court-martial charges were dropped and on Tuesday <PERSON> Deegan </PERSON> held a non-judicial hearing that resulted in final dismissal of the allegation, the attorney said. A base spokesman, Chief Warrant Officer <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Hauth </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Deegan </PERSON> `` was of the opinion that because of her background and training and short time assigned to this <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> command, that fundamental fairness required that she not be held criminally accountable for her relationship.'' Ms. <PERSON> Mazure </PERSON> said she does not believe the incident will affect her career. `` I feel that the work I do and the way I am should be able to show for itself what kind of person I am, that I do intend to make the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> my career,'' she said. Ms. <PERSON> Mazure </PERSON> said she was stationed in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, when she met Price during an evening of dancing in July 1986, and that neither knew the other was in the service until after several dates. They kept in touch through letters when Price was transferred to the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> desert base. She said she was offered a post at Twentynine Palms and was transferred there on Sept. 27, 1987. <PERSON> Rosenbaum </PERSON> said items presented at Tuesday's hearing included a document from the office of the chief of naval operations `` that states that there is no formal policy regarding fraternization.'' Also presented was a 1985 study by the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> `` which found that fraternization ... within one's own chain of command ... was absolutely rampant and that the majority of individuals in the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> simply had no idea as to what constitutes wrongful fraternization,'' he said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman introduced legislation Thursday that would prevent healthy savings institutions from fleeing the ailing federal fund that insures their deposits. Sixteen Democrats and seven Republicans are backing a bill introduced by Rep. <PERSON> Fernand </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> St </PERSON> <PERSON> Germain </PERSON>, D-R. It would bar S & amp; Ls from leaving the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> until Aug. 10, 1989 _ one year longer than a ban currently in effect. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last summer included the initial moratorium in legislation providing for a $ 10.8 billion industry-financed infusion into <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION>, which insures S & amp; L deposits up to $ 100,000. Because the insurance premium charged by <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> is roughly 2 -LCB- times greater than the premium charged the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, legislators fear that thrifts eligible for admission to the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> will leave <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> and become banks. The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, the auditing arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, warned last week that the S & amp; L fund may not have enough money coming in to take care of the roughly 500 S & amp; Ls listed as insolvent. `` Any flight of -LRB- healthy -RRB- institutions whose insurance premiums help pay the bills would be a further blow to an already weakened fund,'' <ORGANIZATION> St </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Germain </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. <ORGANIZATION> St </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Germain </ORGANIZATION> introduced the legislation after receiving a letter Wednesday from the top federal regulator of savings institutions, <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON>, who supports extending the moratorium. <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> said the bank board did not know how many S & amp; Ls would leave the fund if they could, but, he said, `` The most important value in this equation at the moment is perception _ the perception that without the moratorium there may be a major exodus from <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, senior vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutions </ORGANIZATION>, the largest trade group in the industry, said extending the moratorium is unfair to savings institutions and breaks the agreement <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> made with the industry last year. `` We do n't advocate mass exodus. All we're saying is there ought to be free choice,'' <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said.

 The second anti-Castro terrorist bombing here this month forced a forum on U.S.-Cuba relations out of a downtown hotel Thursday, and some Cuban exile leaders say such incidents must end. The 3 a.m. blast Thursday injured no one, but demolished a garage door, tore away part of a concrete wall and blew out the windows of a car at the home of <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Christina </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Coral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gables </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Miami-Dade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> professor who heads a group advocating more dialogue with <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, sponsored a forum on the future of U.S.-Cuba relations on Thursday afternoon. The site of the forum was hastily moved after the bombing. `` This is a cowardly attack,'' she said in her damaged home. `` This is an attack on freedom, democracy and freedom of expression _ the right to do whatever you want in a civilized way.'' The Sheraton-Brickell Point Hotel, where the forum was to take place, pulled out after the bombing. But University of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foote </PERSON> agreed to let the university serve as host for the event instead, `` in the interests of academic freedom,'' said a school spokeswoman, <PERSON> Conchita </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruiz-Topinka </PERSON>. The event went off without incident at the university's faculty club, where security guards screened everyone who attended. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Coral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gables </LOCATION> police were investigating the case. No one claimed responsibility for the attack, but authorities had few doubts about its motivation. `` She feels that a new approach should be used toward <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>,'' said <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Special Agent <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiscynski </PERSON>. `` She has probably made some enemies in the community, and has become the victim of a terrorist attack.'' The bombing was the second this month apparently aimed at protesting closer relations with <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. On May 3, a pipe bomb blew in the door of the Cuban <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> and Culture after a show featuring some painters still in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> who critics said were too close to <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>. Some of the same Cuban radio talks shows and news programs that had called for opposition to the art show also bitterly attacked the forum sponsored by Ms. <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON>'s group, the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cuban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>, and she blamed them for inflaming the situation. `` All of these people in the community that are haranguing people on the radio against our debate today are somewhat responsible for this action, morally at least,'' she said. <PERSON> Xavier </PERSON> <PERSON> Bray </PERSON>, founder of the <ORGANIZATION> Spanish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Discrimination </ORGANIZATION>, said the attacks undermine the freedoms Cubans came to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to enjoy. `` This is n't a question to be settled only by the force of arms, but by the force of reason, by being able to exchange ideas,'' he said Thursday. The bombing came 2 -LCB- hours after a meeting at Ms. <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON>'s house, at which conference organizers decided not to include a visiting representative of the unofficial Cuban human rights commission, <PERSON> Elizardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> <PERSON> Santacruz </PERSON> He is a former political prisoner given permission by the <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> government to set up his organization. His trip to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and request to be included in the forum made anticommunists here suspicious, and the organizers decided his participation would only further anger anti-Castro militants. <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> was allowed into the meeting at the university as an observer, not a participant in the forum. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Ripple </PERSON>, general manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Sheraton-Brickell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Point </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION>, said the hotel canceled the conference `` based on the best interests of our employees and guests because of the recent incidents, including the bombing.''

<HEAD>European Report on Pregnant Women and Drinking</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Pregnant women should limit alcohol consumption to fewer than 10 drinks a week, say researchers who found no evidence of physical harm to the fetuses of women who drank below that amount. The study, at a hospital coordinating European-wide studies on the issue, was reported Thursday in the British Medical Journal. It found that while most of the 846 women surveyed tended to drink little or no alcohol during pregnancy, the few who had more than 10 drinks weekly had babies with smaller-than-normal heads. Babies of mothers who drank more than 12 drinks scored low on a standard test of newborns, indicating the babies were `` at considerable risk,'' the study of mothers in <LOCATION> Dundee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, found. The study defined a standard drink as about .35 ounces of pure alcohol, or about as much as in a glass of wine, eight ounces of beer, or 1.18 ounces of hard liquor. Although some previous studies reached similar findings for low levels of maternal drinking, other studies linked even light drinking with increased risk of slight neurological and behavioral defects in the child. Medical authorities generally recommend that pregnant women avoid alcohol entirely. No `` safe'' consumption level has been firmly established, and some fetuses may be particularly susceptible, they warn. Authors of the new study say their findings indicate that more attention should be paid to detecting and helping mothers whose drinking puts their fetuses at special risk. `` According to our results, we did n't think social drinking created any harm,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Nabeel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sulaiman </PERSON>, of the department of community medicine at <ORGANIZATION> Ninewells </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, where the research was conducted. He added, `` The majority of mothers do abstain or drink very little after learning they were pregnant.'' `` But 2 percent of our women drank more than 10 drinks per week _ that is the risky group. If we want to do anything in terms of health education, we should point it toward these,'' he told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. The 1985-1986 study, published in the May 28 issue of the journal, was carried out at <LOCATION> Ninewells </LOCATION>, a hospital where almost every <ORGANIZATION> Dundee </ORGANIZATION> woman has her baby. <PERSON> Sulaiman </PERSON> said the fact that women in the area have little choice but to go to <LOCATION> Ninewells </LOCATION> to deliver helped provide a better cross-section of the population. The report, based on first children, found that most women naturally tended to drink less or not at all during pregnancy. Before realizing they were pregnant, 90 percent of the women drank, but by the end of the first four months of pregnancy only 56 percent drank, and in later months, only 2 percent. It said a sample of 230 mothers said they drank less due to concern for their baby, problems with nausea, a lack of opportunity or because it smelled or tasted bad. `` From the 92 percent of our sample who were either non-drinkers or consuming less than 50 grams -LRB- 1.75 ounces -RRB- absolute alcohol.. -LRB- per -RRB- week, we conclude that social drinking at a low level is very unlikely to have a harmful effect on the fetus,'' said the article. `` As there was no detectable effect on pregnancy of alcohol consumption below 100 grams -LRB- 3.50 ounces -RRB- ... -LRB- per -RRB- week, it is suggested that health education should be directed toward mothers who drink more than this amount.'' In conclusion, the article said, `` We would advise women who are planning to become pregnant to limit their alcohol consumption.. to below 10 drinks ... -LRB- per -RRB- week.'' Mothers who consumed more than 10 drinks weekly had babies with smaller circumference heads, which `` implies on average that the baby has n't developed to the same degree'' as others, said Dr. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Florey </PERSON>, another of the four authors.

 The first Soviet experts to visit a chemical weapons facility in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> Thursday of blocking progress on a global treaty banning the weapons. At a news conference, the Soviet and British envoys to the 40-nation treaty negotiations disagreed about the consequences of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s resumption of the production of binary chemical weapons last December. <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Nazarkin </PERSON>, chief Soviet envoy to the talks in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plans `` undoubtedly run counter to the aim of a chemical weapons convention and they undermine the confidence-building process.'' But <PERSON> Nazarkin </PERSON> said the three-day visit to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warfare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> by a 13-member group of Soviet technical and military experts helped pave the way for a chemical weapons ban. `` We firmly believe that this convention will be achievable soon,'' he said. He said British officials were forthcoming in talks and helpful in showing the Soviets around the sprawling 7,000-acre facility at <LOCATION> Porton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Down </LOCATION>, where the Soviets watched soldiers in gas masks react to a simulated nerve gas attack. <PERSON> Tessa </PERSON> <PERSON> Solesby </PERSON>, the British negotiator at the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> talks, said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> resumed making chemical weapons to counter the Soviets' production and to replace aging stockpiles Miss Solesby also rejected arguments by <PERSON> Nazarkin </PERSON> that the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> talks needed a push from the American, Soviet and British leaders, and said the main problem was the difficulty of verifying any agreement. `` It is not a matter of lack of political will. ... it's the technical difficulties that remain,'' she said. Dr. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> <PERSON> Pearson </PERSON>, director of the Porton Down center, said the Soviet visit was a `` significant first step toward building confidence between the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> ceased making chemical weapons and destroyed its stockpile in the 1950s and says Porton Down is only for defensive measures, such as the production of gas masks and monitoring equipment. In July, a British team will visit the chemical warfare facility at <LOCATION> Shikhany </LOCATION> in eastern <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>. Western experts visited <PERSON> Shikhany </PERSON> briefly last year and Soviet inspectors went to a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> chemical weapons disposal plant in <LOCATION> Toole </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>. Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> acknowledged last year for the first time that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has a chemical weapon stockpile, which he put at 50,000 tons, but said production of more weapons had stopped. Western governments say the Soviet stockpile totals 300,000 tons, which would make it the largest in the world. The Soviets say the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has a 50,000-ton stockpile _ 20,000 tons higher than Western estimates. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' renewed production of binary weapons _ separate agents that are lethal only when combined _ ended an 18-year moratorium on making the arms.

 A woman who apparently set up housekeeping in <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON>'s house while the TV talk show host was out of town was arrested in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> driving his sports car, authorities said. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>, 36, of no known address, was arrested Sunday night when she stopped at the <LOCATION> Lincoln </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tunnel </LOCATION> as she was driving into <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jesey </LOCATION>. She did n't have the $ 3 toll and told the toll collector she was <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON>'s wife, said <PERSON> Armando </PERSON> <PERSON> Arrastia </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Port </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. A 3-year-old boy was a passenger in the car, <PERSON> Arrastia </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> gave authorities permission to go through the glove compartment of the blue 1988 Porsche Carrera, where they found registration showing the car belongs to <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON>, he said. Authorities `` got in touch with <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON> himself, who said the woman is not his wife and did n't have permission to drive his car,'' said <PERSON> Arrastia </PERSON>. He said he was unsure whether <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON> knew the woman. The host of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Late Night with <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON>'' immediately reported the car stolen to the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canaan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and Ms. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> was charged with receiving stolen property, <PERSON> Arrastia </PERSON> said. `` She gave no indication as to where she was from or what she was doing in the area,'' <PERSON> Arrastia </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> was released into the custody of the <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> prosecutor's office in <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> First Assistant Prosecutor <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> DeStefano </PERSON> said Thursday the woman was arraigned Monday in <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> and bail was set at $ 5,000 with a $ 500 cash option. `` As far as I know it's been posted,'' he said There was no answer at the county jail Thursday night, and efforts to determine how the woman made bail were unsuccessful. <PERSON> DeStefano </PERSON> said she is due to appear on the charge against her in <ORGANIZATION> Weehawken </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Municipal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on May 31. <PERSON> Arrastia </PERSON> said the woman intially `` told the police officer that her name was <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Doe </PERSON>. She said she is also known as <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>.'' She also `` indicated to our police that she is non-domiciled,'' <PERSON> Arrastia </PERSON> said. `` I guess that means homeless in her context.'' <PERSON> Arrastia </PERSON> also did not know what relation, if any, she has to the child. The boy was placed in the custody of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Arrastia </PERSON> said. A spokeswoman for DYFS could not be reached for comment immediately. There was no answer at her office or at her home. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaan </LOCATION> police went to <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON>'s home and found that it had been `` entered,'' said Capt. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Angelastro </PERSON>. He said there appeared to be `` ` some validity'' to a report in Thursday's editions of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> that the woman had moved into <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON>'s house with the child. `` It appears that someone has been living in the house for the last couple of days,'' he said, adding the some plants and a rug appeared to have been moved. `` But we're not saying it was her,'' <PERSON> Angelastro </PERSON> said, because <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON> declined to press charges. `` We are not pursuing it,'' he said. <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON> did not immediately return a telephone call to his <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> offices seeking comment.

 <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> formally asked <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> Thursday to be the host country for a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> jet fighter wing that <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> is expelling from its territory. But the allies quarreled over how to pay for the move, officials said. <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> was expected to accept the 72 nuclear-capable F-16 jets if the allies paid to expand <PERSON> Gioia </PERSON> <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Colle </PERSON>, a small air base in southeastern <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> that could be the planes' new home. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> said a final decision on the Italian site would be made later. He also said details on financing the move would be put off. In <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, a senior <LOCATION> Italian </LOCATION> official said <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> agreed in principle to accept the F-16s, but the government and <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> must still examine the proposal. The issue dominated the opening session of a two-day meeting of defense ministers from all <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> members except <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, which is not part of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s joint military structure. The defense chiefs also planned to issue on Friday a joint statement of support for President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> prior to his meetings next week in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, said the officials. All the officials spoke on condition they not be identified. Alliance officials portrayed the decision to ask <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> to accept the jets as an important display of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s resolve to bear its share of the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> defense burden. `` This is an important step toward preserving <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s common defense and to sharing the burdens of doing so equitably among the alliance as a whole,'' said <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrington </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> secretary-general. `` All agreed that this is an alliance matter and that the alliance should help finance it,'' said Gen. <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Altenburg </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the alliance's chief military adviser. <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> declared in January that the F-16s would have to leave <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> territory within three years as part of a domestically popular drive to lessen the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military presence in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. The planes play an important role in <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s strategy for carrying out a nuclear response to a possible attack by the Soviet-led <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Altenburg </PERSON> told reporters that <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, the alliance's highest military authority, advised the defense ministers meeting that <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> was `` the only suitable country'' to take the aircraft, which are dedicated to the defense of southern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> has indicated it would be willing to have the F-16s based on its soil, as long as a formal <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> request was made and the alliance paid for moving the planes and the 4,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> personnel and their dependents. The <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> defense ministers agreed in principle that the cost of relocating the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> jet fighters should be met by <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s infrastructure budget, which is a common pool of money used to build military facilities There was disagreement, however, over whether the amount needed for the move _ estimated by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials at roughly $ 500 million _ should be added to the infrastructure budget. The American view was that 100 percent of the cost should be added to the budget. Others said no additional money should be made available, according to several officials. It appeared that the financing details would be left unresolved for the time being. The planes are n't scheduled to be moved until 1991. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> told his <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> colleagues that a decision to keep the F-16s in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> would help blunt <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> congressional complaints that the European allies are not pulling their weight in the alliance, said an official who was present at the ministers' meeting. The ministers were expected on Friday to publicly call for an alliance study of how common defense costs and responsibilities are shared.

<TEXT>
 Nicaraguan rebels on Thursday offered a plan to lay down their arms, but set conditions the government termed `` provoking, preposterous'' and contrary to earlier accords. The U.S.-supported rebels, known as Contras, tied their proposal to stop pursuing the 6 -LCB- - year-old war to measures aimed at what they called `` democratization of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. The rebels, speaking at the opening of a new round of peace talks, demanded within five days freedom of the press and broadcast media, an end to the military draft, and freedom to supply their forces in the field. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Espinoza </PERSON>, the presidential spokesman, quickly described the plan as preposterous and said, `` The Contra proposal is unrealistic and casts aside all that has been done and agreed upon until now and makes new proposals.'' Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> said, `` With this proposal, they're acting as if they had won the war and the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> had surrendered.'' <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON>, chief of the rebel delegation, said Thursday the offer contains `` democratic changes the country should make at the end of the war.'' <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> said the leftist Sandinista government was proposing discussion of `` guarantees in the electoral process, dates for municipal elections, reforms in the electoral law, pluralistic representation in the electoral council and guarantees and norms for the functioning of a mixed economy.'' Rebel leaders said their plan deals with both military and political issues. At the center of the Contra proposal was a demand that the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> ease their control over the army and government. They also seek constitutional reforms and freedom of expression. Under what the rebels call a `` flexible'' timetable, they would lay down their arms sometime before Christmas. `` We have come here to present a comprehensive proposal to the government for a global solution to the war,'' <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> said late Wednesday. He leads delegates of the Nicaraguan Resistance, umbrella organization for the rebels. <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> said the rebels were prepared to make a `` special effort to achieve a definitive cease-fire.'' The delegations met under tight security at the Camino Real Hotel. Gen. <PERSON> Humberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, the defense minister and the brother of President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, heads the government delegation. Rebel representatives include their military leader, Col. <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON>, who was making his first trip to <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> since the war started in late 1981. Roman Catholic Cardinal <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> y Bravo and <PERSON> Joao </PERSON> <PERSON> Baena </PERSON> <PERSON> Soares </PERSON>, secretary-general of the Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, were witnesses. <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> said rebels `` are not optimistic'' about the outcome of the meeting because they said the government has not complied with a preliminary peace plan agreed upon March 23 in <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION>, a southern border town. At <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION>, the two sides agreed to a 60-day cease-fire and on the basis for further talks to arrange a permanent truce. The cease-fire expires May 30, but President <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said he would extend it for an additional 30 days. Rebel leaders have said they want a permanent truce but will not break <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s unilateral extension of the peace. The meeting was the third between rebel and government representatives in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> since the Sapoa accord. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> says the war has killed 26,500 people and caused $ 3 billion in damage to the economy.

 The head of the <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION>, accused of taking $ 10,000 to use his influence as a lawmaker to help a murderer get early parole, appeared before a county grand jury Thursday, one day after he was indicted on federal extortion charges. A federal grand jury is scheduled June 14 to hear the bribery charges against <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, the longtime state president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> for the Advancement of Colored People. Federal investigators said their investigation is aimed solely at <ORGANIZATION> Reed </ORGANIZATION>, who's also a state representative. <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> District Attorney <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said the county grand jury is looking into the problem of preferential treatment of prisoners by state parole officials. Several officials of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pardons </ORGANIZATION> and Paroles also appeared before the grand jury Thursday. `` I'd say for the last four or five years we've had a nagging question in this state: Can you buy early release or early parole?'' <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said. `` We're interested in knowing how widespread the practice is.'' <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said the grand jury would probably return Friday for a short session. He did not say when he expected the investigation to finish. <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, co-chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, is accused of taking $ 10,000 from the uncle of <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Chesser </PERSON> and agreeing to use his influence as a legislator to try to get <PERSON> Chesser </PERSON>'s early release from prison. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s investigation surfaced last week, with <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> complaining it was in retaliation for his efforts to remove the Confederate battle flag from the <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> dome. <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, a businessman, in 1970 became one of the first two blacks elected to the <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> Legislature this century. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> got the state parole board to move up <PERSON> Chesser </PERSON>'s parole consideration date from 1994 to 1989. <PERSON> Chesser </PERSON>, convicted of murdering his wife, began serving a 40-year sentence in August 1984. But then <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>'s efforts were reversed, and the uncle demanded a refund. <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> repaid $ 8,000 and promised to refund the rest, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said. The meeting between the uncle and <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> was taped, with the uncle's cooperation, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said. `` You could hear the money being counted,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>'s central <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> district does not include <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Chesser </PERSON>'s hometown of <LOCATION> Phenix </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, and his uncle, <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Chesser </PERSON>, is from <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga </LOCATION>. The two legislators who represent <LOCATION> Phenix </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Corbett </PERSON>, said neither <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Chesser </PERSON> contacted them about getting an early parole for the convicted murderer. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s investigation of <ORGANIZATION> Reed </ORGANIZATION>, 60, surfaced last week, with <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> complaining the probe was in retaliation for his efforts to remove the Confederate flag from the <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> dome. <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> drew widespread attention Feb. 2 when he made a symbolic bid to remove the flag from the Capitol. <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> and 13 other black legislators were arrested and charged with misdemeanor trespassing in a case that is pending. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> has denied any connection between the flag controversy and the case against <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>.

 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Thursday proposed an international strike force to hit `` quick and hard and often'' at foreign drug operations. Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaigned in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> while more than $ 100 million state tax increases neared his governor's desk back in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the all-but-sure Republican presidential nominee, also called for denying federal contracts to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies lacking `` drug-free programs,'' a proposal an aide said could involve mandatory drug testing. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, however, made fun of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s recent drug proposals: `` The question is, ` Why have n't these been done the past seven years? Is n't the vice president in charge of this -LRB- anti-drug -RRB- effort?'' Democrats <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> were concentrating on <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, the biggest delegate prize in the June 7 presidential primary finale, while <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaigned in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> on the way to his <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> seacoast retreat. For <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who has campaigned as a tax-cutting governor, the prospect of being saddled with an election-year tax increase loomed as he sought votes 3,000 miles away. His state legislature gave approval to increases in cigarette and other taxes totaling more than $ 100 million as a remedy for newly found budget deficits. A final vote was needed, but the legislation cleared its major hurdle over Republican objections. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> declined to say whether he would sign the cigarette tax increase. With <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> leading <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in recent polls, the vice president's pollster <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Teeter </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign is concerned but not panic-stricken `` You'd rather be ahead. But surely there is no feeling of crisis or panic,'' <PERSON> Teeter </PERSON> said. `` We're a long way ahead of the election. A lot of decision-making is yet to come.'' An <ORGANIZATION> ABC-Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> poll gave <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> a 53 percent to 40 percent lead over <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday night. The survey, based on telephone interviews with 1,508 people between May 19 and Monday, had a margin of error of 3 percentage points. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> plans to take a week off for meetings with party leaders and advisers in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. He launched a new anti-drug initiative on Thursday, including the call for a drug strike force, possibly under the auspices of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, to be created `` to hit back, quick and hard and often, at foreign drug operations.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> involvement would be coordinated by a military officer reporting to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s vice president. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spoke in <LOCATION> Secaucus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, then visited a drug rehabilitation center in nearby <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, where he talked with patients. He said he opposed relaxing the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s `` zero tolerance'' policy for seizing yachts and other vehicles in which drugs are found. `` I think it makes great sense,'' he said. With his own aides acknowledging the vice president has been hurt by the controversy over Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sought to turn the attention to the Democrats by renewing his call for a federal special prosecutor to investigate <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s finances. `` I wonder if <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> will join me in calling for the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> to appoint a special prosecutor to look into its own troubles, starting with the speaker,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> visited a company-sponsored day care center in <LOCATION> Palo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, where he called for more investment in schools and `` clear guidelines'' to limit corporate mergers. `` Today as in 1960 we're fighting for the economic future of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` And now, as then, old ways simply will not do.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> offered no defense of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, except to say it was `` proper and appropriate'' that the speaker had pledged cooperation with any ethics committee probe into his activities. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> should not try to exploit the <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> issue, and referred again to administration dealings with Panamanian Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. `` I'm going to continue to insist on a full explanation from the administration about what's going on'' with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, he said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also made <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> campaign appearances, a day after he and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> debated in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. He said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has followed his lead on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and in making drugs an issue. `` He is adjusting to a new agenda,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>. The two men met privately after the debate, an hour-long session in which they aimed their strongest words at the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration for dealings with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who released a five-year budget blueprint this week, did urge <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to spell out his spending plans. `` The governor is laying out a budget of promises but not a budget of numbers,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> replied that his experience as governor taught him it was a `` serious mistake'' to lay out a detailed budget plan so far in advance, because the revenue picture can change drastically. The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign, meanwhile, announced the appointment of <PERSON> Dayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> as national press secretary. He was deputy national press secretary in <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>'s 1984 campaign.

 Legislators set aside a drawn-out dispute over election results on Thursday, allowing the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> to convene formally nearly one month late. Lawmakers from the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> and the governing <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> reached accord to open the legislature after three hours of negotiations at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s single-chamber congress. The rightist Alliance, known by its Spanish acronym <PERSON> Arena </PERSON>, won at least 30 seats in March 20 elections for the 60-seat Assembly. <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> contends it won 31 seats and that the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> stole one through fraud. <PERSON> Arena </PERSON>'s claim to the seat is pending before the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elections </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> gave the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> 23 seats and the small <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conciliation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> seven seats. The National Assembly was to have been installed May 1. By Thursday night, only one legislator of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conciliation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> backed the Arena-Christian Democrat agreement. He indicated he would vote with <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> on most bills, in effect giving the rightists a majority. <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarenga </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdivieso </PERSON>, president of the legislature, announced the agreement at an impromptu news conference in the Assembly. `` We have had differing positions and juridical arguments, but when the will exists anything is possible in order to respond to the clamor of a people that wants to see the Assembly working,'' said <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Rey </PERSON> <PERSON> Prendes </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader and a legislator. <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>, president of <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> and one of its lawmakers, said: `` We're pleased this problem has been resolved. Here there are no winners and no losers. From now on, the winner is the <LOCATION> Salvadoran </LOCATION> people, who will benefit by the normalization of the Assembly.'' <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> tried to unilaterally install the legislature on May 1 with its 30 lawmakers. According to law a majority of lawmakers must be on hand to inaugurate an assembly session, and the other parties refused to recognize the body's validity.

Officials did not say if sabotage was suspected. <PERSON> Zulu </PERSON> said the government ordered an investigation. Buildings and factories near the barracks were set ablaze. Shrapnel, debris and the remnants of armor-piercing missiles were found up to 10 miles from the munitions dump. Doctors at <LOCATION> Kabwe </LOCATION> hospital said the wounded included women and children living in houses near the barracks. They said emergency services were disrupted because explosions cut power lines to the hospital and its standby generator had been stolen. Home Minister <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Maluktila </PERSON> and the military and civil defense chiefs visited <LOCATION> Kabwe </LOCATION> on Thursday, officials said.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials on Thursday strongly defended restrictions against <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> becoming a global military power as trade and foreign aid spending transform it into a political and economic superpower. Foreign aid is a natural area for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to contribute to global stability `` given <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s policy, which we fully support ... not to play a global military role,'' said Deputy Defense Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Taft </PERSON> IV. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> will surpass the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as the world's leading aid donor this year and it can still afford a further `` dramatic increase'' in aid, <PERSON> Taft </PERSON> added. <PERSON> Taft </PERSON>'s statement was distributed to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> defense appropriations subcommittee. His position was echoed in testimony by other <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials and the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> at a hearing on the defense burden shared by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> allies, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. Assistant Defense Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Armitage </PERSON> reminded senators that after the defeat of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in World War II, `` the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> played a major and direct role'' in framing the constitution that continues to bar <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> from maintaining offensive military force. Asian neighbors occupied by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> during the war and the Japanese people themselves `` do n't want to see Rising Sun flags on strategic bombers, carrier battle groups or other power projection systems _ nor do we,'' <PERSON> Armitage </PERSON> added. He said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> obviously could afford to spend more on self-defense and will do so, but `` in terms of military roles and missions, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is correctly oriented already.'' Meanwhile, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> should substantially increase unrestricted aid grants to poorer countries in addition to boosting existing support for the upkeep of 55,000 American military personnel in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, he said. Other countries in the region accept a defense-oriented military buildup by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> but `` they remain sensitive about any indication that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> might develop offensive capabilities or seek a regional security role,'' said <PERSON> Gaston </PERSON> <PERSON> Sigur </PERSON>, assistant secretary of state for East Asian and <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> affairs. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has doubled its foreign aid several times since 1980 and in the coming year will pass the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as the world's leading aid donor, <PERSON> Taft </PERSON> said

 The state law that bans exit polling within 200 feet of the voting place is an unconstitutional infringement on the right to free speech, a lawyer for the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> television network argued Thursday. <PERSON> Floyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> attorney specializing in media-related cases, cited a 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> decision striking down a similar law in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state earlier this year. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, in arguments before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Lovell </PERSON>, is trying to have the 1985 law lifted for the state's June 7 primary election. <PERSON> Lovell </PERSON> took the arguments under advisement. No decision is expected until next week. Exit polls ask people after they've cast their ballots for whom they voted and are used by news organizations to project the winners of elections. The state contends its ban protects voters' privacy and voting decorum <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaeffer </PERSON>, an assistant attorney general representing <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, said the law was designed to balance the interests of the media in reporting on elections and the right of voters to `` order and dignity'' at the polls. Some legislators felt voters and been harassed and intimidated by people conducting exit polls in the past, she said. <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> contended that the law was enacted out of frustration over election night projections that declare winners before voting ends and maintains the statute denies the network its First Amendment rights. He said other state laws already protect the decorum of the voting place and can be used if troubles arise with pollsters, he said. Asking people how they voted after they cast their ballots `` can not be said to be an intrusion upon privacy,'' <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said. `` A voter has the right to say ` I do n't want to talk to you','' he said. The 9th Circuit ruled that exit polling is a form of speech protected by the First Amendment. It said the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> law, which prohibited exit polling within 300 feet of a voting place, violated the Constitution and was not the least restrictive means of guaranteeing decorum at the polls.

 Three Americans who court officials said used names of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials to sell phony gold certificates were convicted of fraud Thursday in their absence and given prison terms of five to 12 years. Court officials said the men used names including that of Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> to operate a company with a claimed worth of up to $ 270 million and which sold investment certificates for gold that did not exist. The trial was held at the court of <PERSON> Ras </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Khaimah </PERSON>, one of the seven emirates that make up the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>.

 Federal regulators want a photograph of a deformed infant on the warning label of Accutane, a powerful anti-acne medicine that can damage the fetuses of pregnant women, a pharmaceutical company said Thursday. That and other <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> requirements, which are `` not written in concrete,'' an <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said, follow an <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> panel's recommendation last month that the drug remain on the market. <ORGANIZATION> Hoffman-La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Glynn </PERSON> said the company is `` in agreement with'' the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>'s order, which does not stray much from the advisory panel's recommendations on the prescription drug, which was introduced in 1982. The company agrees that female patients should be shown the infant deformities Accutane can cause, but the photo `` may be more appropriate ... to use on the patient consent materials'' signed in the doctor's office, she said. Those materials, planned for issue early this summer, would include a form to be signed by female patients stating they understand the risks associated with the drug, she said. Ms. <PERSON> Glynn </PERSON> said company officials previously discussed using such a photograph, but not with the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> or the advisory panel. `` It's not an issue of using the picture, it's where you use the picture,'' she said The spokeswoman for the Nutley-based company said <ORGANIZATION> Hoffman-LaRoche </ORGANIZATION> received the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>'s requirements in a letter dated May 19, on Wednesday. She released the order Thursday afternoon. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> left it to <PERSON> Hoffman-La </PERSON> <PERSON> Roche </PERSON> to release the order or keep it confidential, she said. `` But until we have the opportunity to review the letter we're not in a position to say ` Well, yes we agree with this' or ` No, we do n't agree with that,''' she said <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Grigg </PERSON> said that `` there's still some negotiating room'' if the company wants to alter some of the requirements from the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>. `` The agency and the company are trying to emphasize that these are not just minor birth defects that occur rarely, but that if a woman does become pregnant ... the chances are very very high that she will have a very grossly debilitated infant that probably ca n't take care of itself as it grows up,'' <PERSON> Grigg </PERSON> said The advisory panel and the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> embraced a proposal by <PERSON> Roche </PERSON> to sell Accutane only in a so-called blister package in which explicit patient warnings _ including a sketch of a pregnant woman with a red X drawn through it _ would be sealed in at the factory to make sure the patient would see them. `` Everybody agrees that we have to minimize birth defects if the drug is going to remain on the market,'' <PERSON> Grigg </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Glynn </PERSON> said the company, which must respond to the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>'s letter within 15 days, hopes to have the patient consent kit on the market by late June, and have the new blister packaging in drug stores no later than September Since its introduction in 1982, Accutane has carried specific and explicit warnings that there is a high risk it will cause birth defects if taken during pregnancy. Those warnings have been strengthened in recent years, but the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> grew concerned that too many women, and perhaps doctors, were ignoring them. The advisory panel that convened in April concluded the benefits of the drug _ the only one on the market that can cure the severe scarring type of acne it is intended to treat _ outweighed the risk of misuse. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> has received reports of 66 birth defects associated with the drug since 1982. Forty-five of the defects were in the first two years of the drug's use when warnings were less severe. There have been 21 reports since 1985, when labeling cautions were strengthened.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, heading toward pre-summit approval of the historic treaty banning medium-range nuclear missiles, voted overwhelmingly Thursday to restrict a future president's power to change the treaty's interpretation, but delayed a final vote on the treaty until at least Friday. The 72-27 decision settled the last major issue before floor action on the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> later killed, 53-45, a Republican-backed amendment which would essentially have reversed the earlier decision, and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, angered that the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> had spent time revisiting the same issue, abandoned efforts to finish action on the pact Thursday `` If we're going to continue to have <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Mouse </PERSON> amendments like this, the president is not going to have his treaty before he leaves the summit,'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> shortly before it quit for the evening. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> was angry because he said he felt the treaty interpretation issue had been settled by the earlier amendment, adopted by the 72-27 margin. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> leaders had made victory on the issue one of their major goals in the debate over the treaty. Senate Republican Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., agreed with <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> that work on the treaty is likely to be finished Friday The INF treaty, signed Dec. 8 by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> at their <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> summit, requires elimination within three years of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> nuclear missiles with a range of 300 miles to 3,400 miles. It would result in the elimination of 867 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> missiles in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and elimination of 1,752 Soviet missiles. Ratification is assured because it only requires 67 votes and 90 or more of the 100 senators are likely to vote for the pact, according to <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> and other senators. Approval would mean the treaty could be rushed to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> before <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> meet Sunday at the summit. White House chief of staff <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> was standing by to carry the ratification papers to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. The pact will be the first ratified by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> since the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. Also, it will be the first treaty to actually require the destruction of weapons, rather than simply slowing the build-up, and its far-reaching verification provisions include the first on-site inspections allowed by either superpower. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted 96-0 approval Thursday of an amendment which incorporates into the treaty agreements reached two weeks ago by Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, dealing with weapons using `` futuristic'' technology and clarifying on-site verification rules. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has been working on the pact since last week, and the last major hurdle was cleared Wednesday when <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, the chief critic, dropped his opposition. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> had scheduled a vote Thursday to halt the delaying tactics used by <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> conservatives, but that vote was set aside when offstage negotiations reached the agreement permitting the final vote. The main unresolved issue did n't affect the INF treaty, but it involved a long-running fight between the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and the Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> over the issue involving the constitutional authority to interpret treaties. The amendment approved Thursday requires <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approval if any future president tries to reinterpret the treaty. The fight arose from <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s assertion that he has the legal authority to unilaterally reinterpret the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty to permit expanded tests of his Star Wars anti-missile defense. Congressional Democrats have disputed that claim and argue that their amendment to the INF pact is an attempt to preserve the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s constitutional power to advise and consent on treaties. But critics say the amendment would unfairly restrict a president. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> told his colleagues Thursday that accepting the administration's claim to having unilateral power to reinterpret treaties `` would reduce the constitutional role of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to a mere nullity. The consent of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> would be reduced to a clerical function.'' Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, agreed with <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, saying, `` We would be ill-served by that kind of process and our foreign policy would be damaged severely. But Sen. <PERSON> Arlen </PERSON> <PERSON> Specter </PERSON>, R-Pa., said the amendment `` holds a switchblade knife at the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>'' because it imposed a standard on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> not imposed on the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, R-Calif., called the amendment `` palpably ridiculous, a dereliction of duty'' and said it would put the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on record as asserting authority he contended it did not possess under the Constitution Ratification would cap an 11-year fight which began with the 1977 deployment by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> of SS-20 missiles, a triple-warhead weapon which was used to replace the Soviets' older SS-4 and SS-5 missiles. The first major alarm was raised in October, 1977, when <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON>, then chancellor of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, warned in a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> speech that the SS-20s were a serious threat to the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. In response, <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> began discussing deployment of new atomic-tipped weapons. Those discussions culminated in the Dec. 13, 1979 decision by <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> to adopt what became known as the `` two-track'' decision. That involved the dual decision to both pursue arms negotiations at the same time new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> atomic weapons were being installed. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> decided that four years later, beginning in late 1983, it would deploy 572 new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> atomic weapons, including 108 Pershing IIs which would be stationed in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, and another 464 ground-launched cruise missiles for deployment in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>. Late in 1981, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> announced that his administration was adopting the so-called `` zero option'' as its position in the INF talks. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plan, which originated with West German politicians, called for halting the planned <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> deployments if the Soviets withdrew their SS-20s. Administration critics said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plan was unrealistic. In 1982, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Nitze </PERSON>, the top <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiator, and his Soviet counterpart, <PERSON> Yuli </PERSON> <PERSON> Kvitsinsky </PERSON>, agreed privately on a formula for a proposed INF agreement. It became known as the `` walk in the woods,'' but it was rejected by both the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet governments. The <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> deployments started in November 1983, in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, and the Soviets responded by walking out of the INF talks. The negotiations resumed in the spring of 1985, after <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> took over power.

 President <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaunda </PERSON> accused Western governments Thursday of not doing enough to fight apartheid as he opened the annual summit of the Organization of African Unity. `` Inside <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, the racist regime has made efforts to intensify its acts of oppression,'' he told 30 African heads of state attending the summit, which marked the organization's 25th anniversary. `` Many people are still being killed, maimed or imprisoned. `` How is it possible for major <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> countries to claim that they must deal with the racist regime because sanctions do n't work? he asked, pausing to wipe tears from his eyes. `` Am I to conclude that the reason they acted against <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> is that those who died were white people?'' said <PERSON> Kaunda </PERSON>, the outgoing <ORGANIZATION> OAU </ORGANIZATION> chairman. `` If so, what conclusion am I going to make that they are not prepared to act against the new <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>, -LRB- President P.W. -RRB- <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>?'' He said <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s struggle had never been `` and will never be anti-white, it will always be anti-apartheid.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said in a message to the <ORGANIZATION> OAU </ORGANIZATION> that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> abhors `` the ugly system of apartheid'' and is commited to helping <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> become a democratic society. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said he would have attended the meeting, but the date conflicted with this week's superpower summit. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, a deputy assistant secretary of state for <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> affairs, went instead. <PERSON> Kaunda </PERSON> thanked the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for imposing limited sanctions on <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> and expressed gratitude to American church leaders and students for supporting anti-apartheid efforts. He also thanked people in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> `` who against their governments are supporting our cause,'' and the Nordic countries. The <ORGANIZATION> OAU </ORGANIZATION> has frequently denounced <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and demanded that Western governments impose mandatory sanctions against the white-led government. At the same time, black <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> does about $ 1 billion a year in business with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, much of it covertly. <LOCATION> Mali </LOCATION>'s president, Gen. <PERSON> Moussa </PERSON> <PERSON> Traore </PERSON>, was elected Thursday to succeed <PERSON> Kaunda </PERSON> in the chairman post, which switches every year between representatives of northern and sub-Saharan <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Traore </PERSON> urged the <ORGANIZATION> OAU </ORGANIZATION> to `` further improve our methods of struggle so as to fully dismantle apartheid and increase moral and material support to the peoples of south <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> and the frontline states.'' <PERSON> Traore </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> OAU </ORGANIZATION> efforts to end the <LOCATION> Libya-Chad </LOCATION> dispute were `` clear evidence of the ability of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to transcend its differences.'' <PERSON> Kaunda </PERSON> mediated a cease-fire between the North African nations in September. On Wednesday, <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION> that he had declared an end to the 15-year-old war in honor of the <ORGANIZATION> OAU </ORGANIZATION>'s 25th anniversary. President <PERSON> Hissene </PERSON> <PERSON> Habre </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION>, attending the summit, expressed `` cautious optimism'' about <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>'s overture. <PERSON> Traore </PERSON> also praised <LOCATION> Ethiopian </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Mengistu </PERSON> <PERSON> Haile </PERSON> <PERSON> Mariam </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION>'s president, <PERSON> Mohamed </PERSON> <PERSON> Siad </PERSON> <PERSON> Barre </PERSON>, for their resumption of diplomatic ties last month after an 11-year break prompted by their desert war. By law and custom in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which the country's 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs.

 <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> agreed Wednesday to resume security meetings that lapsed three years ago when relations between the two countries deteriorated. A meeting between the two countries on Wednesday included ranking diplomats and military officials and was the latest indication that hostilities were easing. The two sides said in a statement that they would resume meetings of a joint security commission `` at the earliest possible date.'' The commission was set up in line with the 1984 <LOCATION> Nkomati </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Accord </LOCATION>, a mutual non-aggression treaty in which each country pledged to halt support for guerrillas fighting against the other government. The commission has been defunct since 1985, when <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> found documents indicating that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> was still aiding Mozambican rebels despite the treaty. Since then, <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> has persistently accused <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> of continued covert aid to the <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> National Resistance rebel movement. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> denies it.

But, when asked about the chances of implementing a Soviet proposal for the creation of a U.N.-sponsored force to replace the individual contingents in the gulf, he said: `` We do n't see it as an immediate possibility at all.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> have forces in the gulf to protect ships bearing their national flags and to destroy mines. `` It sounds attractive in theory but it would be very difficult to put ... together in practical terms,'' <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said. `` There has never been a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> naval task force of that kind and certainly not when two parties are still actively at war.'' <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> met earlier Wednesday with Crown Prince <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamad </PERSON> <PERSON> bin </PERSON> <PERSON> Isa </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Khalifa </PERSON>, commander of the <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION> Defense Force. The British minister said countries in the region have been `` very helpful'' in efforts to limit the effects of the 7 -LCB- - year-old war on shipping lanes of the oil-rich region <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said there have been `` less hostilities and less activities at sea than would probably have been the case before'' the foreign navies sent forces to the gulf. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> attacks neutral vessels in retaliation for Iraqi raids on its shipping lanes. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> also has been blamed for sowing mines in the waterway. Earlier this month, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> expanded the duties of its naval task force, allowing the warships to intervene in attacks on neutral vessels even if they were not flying <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flags. <PERSON> Steward </PERSON> welcomed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision, but would not say if <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> will follow suit. So far, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has not attacked vessels under any military escort. One of the British warships, the frigate HMS Beaver, is on a port call in <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> was scheduled to inspect it and to visit other gulf countries.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> MOSCOW </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- - <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Maximovna </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, who charms the Western press on her trips abroad, is given far less attention on her own turf by a Soviet media that plays down the high profile of its first lady. The poised, tastefully dressed and alternately demure and gregarious wife of Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has made several public appearances in the last few months. She attended May Day celebrations, where she stood at the edge of Red Square chatting with her daughter, <PERSON> Irina </PERSON>, a physician in her 30s, and with wives of other party and state dignitaries. Earlier this month, she attended a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> performance of the Dance Theater of <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION>. Within the last few months she has been shown briefly on Vremya, the state-controlled television station's evening newscast, viewing Western art exhibits But the auburn-haired Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is seldom seen in shouted exchanges similar to those between <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and the White House press corps. Although Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> generally seems amenable to questions from the foreign press, similar chats rarely occur with Soviet reporters, who have no tradition of reporting on their first lady. In <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> earlier this year, when <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> reporters wanted to talk with her, she sought out a <LOCATION> Yugoslavian </LOCATION> journalist and told him to ask a question before she would respond to others. Like <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> himself, the Soviet first lady has become somewhat controversial. `` The Soviet people do not believe that wives should influence a leader politically,'' said a 34-year-old teacher. `` They are not used to it. And they ask, ` why should she influence affairs of our country?''' Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> appears to serve as an unofficial adviser to her husband in a manner similar to former first lady <PERSON> Rosalynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>. But the extent to which she discusses policy with her husband is unknown among the Soviet people. When Soviet television broadcast <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s interview with <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> anchorman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Brokaw </PERSON> in early December, it censored the Soviet leader's comment that he discusses `` everything,'' including Soviet affairs at the highest level, with his wife. The reference to Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s role as unofficial adviser to her husband was the only portion of the interview not broadcast to viewers, indicating just how sensitive her high profile has become. Foreign dignitaries who have met the 56-year-old Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> describe her as well-informed on international and domestic affairs. But her knowledge of political affairs is not flawless, as revealed during her <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> visit in early December for the superpower summit. When talking with a group of Armenians who had emigrated to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told them the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has always had a good relationship with <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> is one of 15 Soviet republics and, therefore, its people are Soviet citizens. Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is frequently seen at her husband's side when he travels around the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, and she has accompanied him on all of his trips abroad. Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has been active in promoting an exchange of fashion and design ideas with Western firms and holds an official position as a member of the Soviet Cultural Fund. Her wardrobe is smart and varied and has been supplemented by gifts from <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> couturiers during the couple's official visit to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1985. She is seldom seen in the same outfit twice when the average Soviet woman usually has no more than three or four changes of clothes to wear to work. Last year on a visit to <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, she was shown leaving <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> wearing a fur hat and coat. But Soviet television also ran pictures of the <ORGANIZATION> Gorbachevs </ORGANIZATION>' arrival, revealing that Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> had changed in flight into a cloche cap and wool coat. <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Maximovna </PERSON> <PERSON> Titorenko </PERSON> was born on Jan. 5, 1932. She and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> met at the boarding house where both lived as students at <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. She studied sociology, while he studied law. They moved to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s home region of <LOCATION> Stavropol </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> when he graduated in 1955. Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> took a job as lecturer at her alma mater when her husband, by then a rising party official, returned to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. She gave up her job when <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> became Communist Party chief. The <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s have one daughter and two granddaughters.

<HEAD>Money Market Funds Not All The Same</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In the climate of uncertainty that has prevailed since the stock market crash last fall, many savers and investors have opted for the safe harbor of money market mutual funds. It is easy to think of money funds as a kind of generic, one-size-fits-all product, since all of them do pretty much the same thing _ investing in short-term, interest-bearing securities for a respectable yield with safety and liquidity. Their net asset values are kept constant, leaving no price performance comparisons to differentiate among them. Thus, many people do n't devote great amounts of time and energy to choosing a particular fund, but rather go with whichever one is handiest, commonly at a brokerage firm or mutual fund group with which they already have dealings. Convenience is indeed an important consideration in picking a money fund. And most financial advisers agree that money funds as a group are very safe investments, even though they lack the federal insurance that banks and savings institutions can offer on deposits. Still, students of the subject say there can be significant differences between funds that are worth heeding, in order to maximize both your financial return and your peace of mind. In a mid-May tabulation of 322 funds that invest in taxable securities, <PERSON> Donoghue </PERSON>'s Money Fund Report put their average annual yield, based on the results of the most recent seven days and including the effects of compounding, at 6.47 percent. Among the individual funds, the yields ranged from 5.7 percent to 7.2 percent. Such a variance does n't mean much to someone investing just $ 1,000 or $ 2,000. With more substantial sums, however, it starts to add up. Why would one fund yield a good deal more than the other? One common explanation lies in differing investment philosophies. An aggressive fund management might stretch its yield by concentrating on securities considered a little more risky than <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills _ for example, commercial paper issued by corporations with credit ratings a shade or two below the top. A large number of more conservative funds confine themselves exclusively to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government securities that are guaranteed by the government against default, sacrificing a bit in yield for the sake of an extra measure of safety. In addition, a fund can seek an enhanced yield by lengthening the maturity of the securities it owns. In theory at least, longer maturities should carry at least slightly higher yields because of the increased risk they represent. Among the funds tracked by the Donoghue organization, average maturities recently ranged from one to 81 days. While such considerations tend to justify yield differences between funds, says <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Fosback </PERSON>, editor of the advisory letter Income & amp; Safety, they by no means account for all of those differences. `` The majority of the yield differential is due to varying expense ratios,'' he says. <PERSON> Fosback </PERSON> cited a recent <PERSON> Donoghue </PERSON> survey that found high-yielding funds running expenses that effectively lowered their return to investors by half a percentage point. The lowest-yielding funds, by contrast, had expenses to the tune of 1.2 percentage points. That's just the opposite of the way things should ideally work. A fund that costs more to operate should earn its keep by producing superior results. The message, as summarized by <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> in his Handbook For No-Load Fund Investors: `` Avoid high expense ratio funds. A high expense ratio almost always means a lower net yield to you.''

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s marketplace has become so marked by irrational ups and downs, especially for financial products such as stock and bonds, that it has been said in jest that it should be institutionalized. That, of course, is one of the problems. Trading by institutions, not of the mental sort as suggested by the jest, but mutual funds, pension funds and the like, have come to dominate the marketplace. Not only are they large, but often they think and act alike, producing a combination that can change the market's direction on what might otherwise seem to be insignificant news. In a sense, the market can trip over a pebble. However, institutions are probably but one of several reasons for the frenzies, fads, flipflops and phobias that seem to grip the market. Technology, financial journalism, economic uncertainty and internationalization also are factors. That is the contention of economist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuccillo </PERSON> who, though his specialty is real estate _ he is <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION> senior vice president _ has produced one of the most cogent explanations of current market behavior. In the past, he states, panics occurred infrequently. From 1907 to 1929, for example, there was almost nothing to rate the designation. Now, we see big changes in stocks, interest rates, currency values and more on a weekly basis. In explanation, he cites five factors: _ Big block trading Stock and bond price indexes are weighted averages of daily trades, and they are watched closely by mutual and pension funds and other big institutional players. Since institutions, as opposed to individuals, now dominate the market, even slight changes in indexes can causes a great deal of weight to be thrown around, simply because of the size of the trades. _ Computerization has given even more weight to the activities of these large traders, most of whom use computers to signal the proper time to buy and sell The problem, says <PERSON> Tuccillo </PERSON>, is that `` all the programs give off the same signals.'' When the market moves, `` technology will give it a further momentum,'' turning what might have been small swings into avalanches. _ With the proliferation of financial television shows and newspapers there has been increasing competition for stories `` So, just as TV news has made stars of tin-horn felons and obscure rebellions, TV financial news has made stars out of statistics and even -LRB- ugh! -RRB- economists.'' Should traders care about the monthly trade numbers? No, says <PERSON> Tuccillo </PERSON>. `` Monthly numbers are unreliable and the true picture is shown only annually.'' Do they care? `` Probably a lot.'' Why? `` The financial media tell them to.'' `` The result is a jittery market that hangs on the arithmetic of obscure bureaucrats.'' _ The crash of October 1987 so shattered confidence that most players do n't know what to believe `` Hence, they soar on a ` good' numbers and crash on a ` bad' one. And it does n't help that the media produce reams of instant analysis.'' _ Internationalization Financial markets now trade around the clock. What happens in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> affects markets in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and on again around the globe until cause and effect are obscured. `` As the players increase in number ... the risk of strong movement increases.'' <PERSON> Tuccillo </PERSON>'s conclusion and advice: `` The economy in 1988, although weaker than last year, is growing in an atmosphere of steady -LRB- interest -RRB- rates and low inflation.

 When <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was 17, he borrowed his mother's new convertible on a school night and smashed one of the lights trying to negotiate his way out of a gas station. True to his super-straight image, the teen-ager went home and waited for hours for his mother and father to return home to tell them of the mishap. `` He could n't go to sleep, he could n't go to bed without first telling me,'' recalls his mother, 84-year-old <PERSON> Euterpe </PERSON> <PERSON> Boukis </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. There are no negatives in her assessment of the politician whose first bid for office ended in the presidency _ of his third-grade class. When asked what her strongest criticism of her son would be, she scolded a reporter, `` That's a terrible thing to ask a mother.'' She even insists that he is not as humorless as many people seem to think. `` Campaigning -LRB- is -RRB- serious business and he can not be a jokester,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` When we are together, in gatherings with family, friends, parties, he's just jovial.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, dressed in a blue sweater buttoned to the neck and a neatly pressed blue-green plaid skirt, sat straight in her arm chair during an interview and grudgingly held a high school photograph of her son at the request of a photographer. `` That would be too sentimental,'' she said of the pose. Many photos of her late husband, <PERSON> Panos </PERSON>, and her son's family can be found in almost every room of her home. In the living room, a small teddy-bear with a miniature `` <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for President'' T-shirt is seated on a rocking chair. Mother and son remain very close, despite his exhausting schedule. `` He calls his mother every other day. He called me this morning to tell me what the plans are for the week,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` We do n't see each other as much as we used to, but he never forgets.'' The likely Democratic nominee for president rarely fails to mention his immigrant parents in his campaign speeches. <PERSON> Panos </PERSON>, his father, came to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> speaking little English when he was just 15 and worked in the mills to put himself through <ORGANIZATION> Bates </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. After only eight years in the country, he went to <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> and became a successful obstetrician. He died in 1979. The candidate's mother emigrated from <LOCATION> Larissa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, at age 9 and worked with her family in the textile factories in <LOCATION> Haverhill </LOCATION>. In 1921 she became the first girl of about 3,000 Greeks from her hometown to go to college. She graduated Phi Beta Kappa from <PERSON> Bates </PERSON> and taught English and history in <LOCATION> Ashland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Amesbury </LOCATION> schools. `` <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> is so proud of that fact,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. Despite her age, Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has made many campaign appearances on her son's behalf. Last December, for example, when <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was tied up with gubernatorial duties, she went to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> to officially register her son for the state's first-in-the-nation primary. `` I love it, it's very interesting. This has been a wonderful opportunity for me to get to know the country,'' she said. Asked point blank why her son should be president, <PERSON> Euterpe </PERSON> said, `` His strength of character. He will always obey the law, which our present administration has n't done at all. They've been conniving, they've been underhanded, and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> would never do that.'' She also said her son's family would set a good role model for the nation. `` Because we grew in an ethnic family we kept the old values of discipline, of respect for older people, of family closeness,'' she said. `` What a wonderful role model <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON> and the family, a close family, a loving family -LRB- would be -RRB- in contrast to what we have now,'' she said. <PERSON> Euterpe </PERSON> said that family tradition includes a sense of duty and discipline. When <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> and his older brother <PERSON> Stelian </PERSON> _ who struggled with mental problems and died after being struck by a car while riding his bike in 1973 _ were growing up, they never received allowances for household chores like the other children in the neighborhood. `` We are all members of the family, we do n't pay each other for what we do for each other,'' said the governor's mother.

<HEAD>Liza Minnelli in Unusual Variety Special on ABC</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY CAMPBELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 It's been 16 years since <PERSON> Liza </PERSON> <PERSON> Minnelli </PERSON>'s had a special on network television, and it took an unusual idea to get her onto the small screen for `` <PERSON> Liza </PERSON> <PERSON> Minnelli </PERSON>: Triple Play'' on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> next Tuesday. `` They -LRB- ABC -RRB- ask me every year. This year I think we shocked them because we said ` yes.' It took me since 1972 to think of something different,'' <PERSON> Minnelli </PERSON> said recently on a shooting break. `` The last special that was my own was in 1972. I was in ` <PERSON> Baryshnikov </PERSON> on Broadway' and ` Goldie and <PERSON> Liza </PERSON> <PERSON> Together </PERSON>,' not my own. `` I got tired of ` in concert.' ` <PERSON> Liza </PERSON> with a Z' was the first in-concert special. Then everybody else did them.'' The one-hour special will air next Tuesday. <PERSON> Minnelli </PERSON>'s co-stars are <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubinstein </PERSON>, <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Gossett </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neal </PERSON>. `` The best thing about it is not having to perform alone,'' <PERSON> Minnelli </PERSON> said, `` not going out there, singing your songs and going home. You get to the point where the joy is working with other people. That's where the real kick is and the challenge, too. I'm working with people I admire and had n't had a chance to work with before. Songwriter <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Ebb </PERSON> had the idea that made <PERSON> Minnelli </PERSON> say `` yes'' this time. The same four-line dialogue to begin a short play was given to three sets of writers _ <PERSON> Lanford </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Terrence </PERSON> <PERSON> McNally </PERSON> with <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wasserstein </PERSON>, and Ebb and his partner <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kander </PERSON>. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> wrote a drama, <PERSON> McNally </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wasserstein </PERSON> a romantic fantasy and <PERSON> Kander </PERSON> and Ebb a musical. <PERSON> Minnelli </PERSON> has worked with <PERSON> Kander </PERSON> and Ebb a lot and was in the 1984 Broadway musical `` The Rink,'' with book by <PERSON> McNally </PERSON>. `` We got the writers we wanted, first crack out of the box,'' she said. `` We were really thrilled. `` We did n't know what they were writing. We hired the best and trusted them.'' <PERSON> Minnelli </PERSON> got British director Piers Haggard whom she had n't worked with before but admired `` <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scorsese </PERSON> one day showed me two episodes of the original British TV version of ` Pennies from Heaven' that Piers directed. It was brilliant,'' she said. `` When I went to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> in 1983 I looked him up. Calling strangers is something I'm not wont to do, but I was in such admiration of this man. `` I've kept looking for things to do with him. This is just perfect. He has understood the different styles and made this work, within our budget.'' The scenes shot the day of the interview take place in a parlor complete with <PERSON> Tiffany </PERSON> lamps. Stand-ins walked through, while minions with tape measures and light meters announced measurements to adjusters of light reflectors. Then <PERSON> Minnelli </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rubinstein </PERSON> rehearsed moving from chair to settee. <PERSON> Haggard </PERSON> had them repeat it slower. <PERSON> Minnelli </PERSON> asked that her chair cushion be higher and two blankets were folded under it. She thanked the woman who handed her the high-heeled shoes that she donned for the scene's three takes. <PERSON> Minnelli </PERSON> wo n't be watching her `` Triple Play.'' As soon as shooting ended, she and her husband, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Gero </PERSON>, left for a European vacation. She has accepted an invitation from <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> to replace <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> in six weeks of concerts next fall. Meanwhile, she said, she needed the vacation because of the grueling schedule of the TV special. `` We work from 6 in the morning to 8 at night, then go home and faint. But I'm healthy and enjoying it. A lot of it is making sure when I'm working I get plenty of sleep. `` There's a basic tension in the air,'' she said. `` I think the writers have done some really gutsy stuff that has n't been seen. It's not just nice, safe, sitcom stuff. It is about interesting things. We'll see how it goes over. `` I think we're taking some chances, some risks. Anytime you try to do that, it's a little anxious, a little nervous.''

<TEXT>
 The oil that made the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> rich now is fouling it. Environmental experts say oil pollution has never been worse, and while they regard it as an indirect result of the 7 -LCB- - year-old war between <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, the actual source remains unknown `` Nobody can do anything until the war is stopped, because it is too difficult to find the sources of the leakage,'' said <PERSON> Jassim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Qaseer </PERSON>, acting director of fisheries in this island state. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, however, has reported what it called an `` unprececented'' oil slick in the Stait of <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION> in the southern gulf and said it resulted from an Iraqi air raid on the <LOCATION> Larak </LOCATION> offshore oil terminal in the area. The <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> quoted an official of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Environment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> as saying thousands of fish have died and that the livelihood of local fishermen is endangered <PERSON> Walt </PERSON> <PERSON> Vreeland </PERSON>, an American adviser to the Bahrain-based <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said the war restricts scouting of the gulf for signs of oil pollution. `` We're very limited as to how far we can go out,'' said <PERSON> Vreeland </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> Bucks </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION> `` <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>'s territorial waters are 12 miles, and to be quite honest about it, I'm not going to go 50 miles in a helicopter. No way.'' <PERSON> Vreeland </PERSON> said in an interview that <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>, which is about halfway up the 600-mile-long gulf, is among the hardest-hit areas, at a time when it is trying to attract tourists to its beaches. `` The main thing you'll find are aesthetic problems. People just do n't want to go to the beach because it's a mess down there,'' <PERSON> Vreeland </PERSON> added. `` The other indirect effects would be reduction of fish, of sea grass beds. These are not areas you would expect to see immediate effects.'' Cleanup efforts already are under way on <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>'s beaches, but the oil remains in the water. `` I could see tar and tarballs all around. And when I saw the windsurfing boards, they had all turned black from the tar,'' said a foreign resident, <PERSON> Ikuko </PERSON> <PERSON> Waki </PERSON>. Oil pollution is not new to the gulf, where wells on shore and underwater produce nearly a fifth of the industrial world's petroleum In the past, however, the gulf could handle the occasional oil spill. Extremely shallow along the coasts and about 300 feet at its deepest, the gulf is fed from the north by the <LOCATION> Tigris </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Euphrates </LOCATION> rivers. Naturally cycled every two years, the water flows out through the <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION>, a passage so narrow as to prevent a large volume of water exchange between the gulf and the <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. `` You have to realize we're dealing with an oil spill of unknown source, of unknown size, of unknown duration,'' said <PERSON> Vreeland </PERSON>. `` We do n't know where it's coming from, we do n't know how much is coming in. It's very widespread.'' Observers say more clumps of oil are floating in the southern gulf than at any time in the past year. Gulf-based shipping executives believe some is from three Iranian oil platforms wrecked by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> in recent reprisal attacks. <PERSON> Vreeland </PERSON> says it is n't known if they are leaking oil Another suspected source is <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s big <LOCATION> Kharg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> oil terminal in the <LOCATION> northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> gulf </LOCATION>. It has been attacked by Iraqi planes several times, but <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has never reported on damage. <PERSON> Al-Qaseer </PERSON> says pollution threatens a commercial fishing industry, already affected by the war. South-flowing currents help to keep northern waters clean, but `` fishermen are afraid to go there'' because of the fighting, he said. <PERSON> Vreeland </PERSON> said that even after the disappearance of light fractions of the oil, which are most toxic to marine life, the heavy residue collects dirt and debris and sinks to the seabed, affecting some sea life. As scientists analyze oil samples in a search for the source, public concern is growing. Gulf-area newspapers give wide coverage to the prpblem, and environmental groups meet regularly. `` It's going to destroy the shoreline, destroy some of the beaches, some of the rocky shores,'' <PERSON> Vreeland </PERSON> said. Nor is the threat short-term, he said. `` I foresee this happening again and again, and until the Iraq-Iran war stops, until we can get surveillance out and actually watch what's going on, there's nothing we can do about it.''

 Of the three countries taken by the communists in the <LOCATION> Indochina </LOCATION> war, <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> has been the one least heard from _ a nation drawn in upon itself. But an <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> correspondent who had been to <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> during the war years and afterward on rare visits was allowed back for a 10-day stay recently and found the government is changing its ways, to a degree.

<DATELINE>VIENTIANE, Laos (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The communist leaders of remote <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> are loosening their grip on the country in a local version of the Kremlin's sweeping reforms. Under the banner of the `` New Economic Mechanism,'' ownership and inheritance of private property have been newly sanctioned, a code encouraging investment from the capitalist world has been passed, and plans are under way to cut by one-third a bureaucracy that controlled the lives of <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>' 3.9 million citizens. Although still a one-party state wary of political dissidents and run by some of the world's most durable revolutionaries, <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> may go farther in liberalizing its economy than neighboring <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and a number of other communist countries, according to Western diplomats stationed here. `` People are beginning to smile again,'' said one European who has known the country for decades. While state co-operatives do exist, bonuses and other incentives have been introduced, and several purportedly socialist enterprises visited appeared to have the loosest kind of structure. `` Go see what we have in the co-operative store, then come back and buy from me,'' said a friendly old woman trying to sell hand-woven cloth to visiting Western journalists. Although still quiet and slow-paced by most measurements, striking changes are apparent in <LOCATION> Vientiane </LOCATION>, the capital city of 250,000. The tailors and jewelers along <PERSON> Samsenthai </PERSON>, the city's main commercial street, are back in business, as are the dance halls where women in sarongs and their partners alternate between traditional `` ramwong'' music and semi-hard rock. Unthinkable a few years ago, <LOCATION> Laotian </LOCATION> women now dance with foreigners at some clubs. Teen-agers wear longish hair and Western fashions, which in the early days of communist rule was enough to have them branded as `` decadent hippies'' and sent off to re-education camps. At the city's sprawling central market, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollars, <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> baht and the local kip currency are all legally used to buy Japanese television sets, Thai-made `` designer'' clothes, European liquor and a wide variety of local farm produce. The newly remodeled market is on lease for 10 years to <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> businessmen who share profits with the government. Economically booming <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> next door is the source of most consumer goods, which are traded or smuggled across the <LOCATION> Mekong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> frontier. Local purchasing power is fueled by some $ 3 million to $ 5 million yearly sent home to relatives by refugees in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and elsewhere. `` Business is getting better every day,'' said <PERSON> Virachit </PERSON> <PERSON> Philaphandeth </PERSON>, one of a growing number of enterpreneurs whose monthly 300,000 kip -LRB- $ 850 -RRB- in net profit is about 50 times the wage of a middle-ranked government official. <PERSON> Virachit </PERSON>, whose ventures include a lumber mill, said growing confidence in the New Economic Mechanism is leading to more domestic investment and a mini-boom in private home-building, which is evident in <LOCATION> Vientiane </LOCATION> and other areas of <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>. The new policies, the diplomats agree, have been influenced by General Secretary <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, as well as by reforms in neighboring <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, and by television programs, avidly watched here, from robustly capitalist, pro-Western <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>. The reforms are also apparent reactions to the period between the communist victory in 1975 and about 1980, when the regime attempted to collectivize peasants, flirted with inappropriate industrial projects and attempted lifestyle changes antithetical to the basic Laotian character and traditions. The economy stagnated. An estimated 350,000 people, including a bulk of <LOCATION> Vientiane </LOCATION>'s skilled middle class, fled the country and adherents of the toppled, U.S.-backed government were sent to harsh re-education camps. An insurgency flickered. Although <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> did not suffer the postwar traumas of its Indochinese neighbors, <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, neither was the transition a `` Song and Dance Revolution'' as some observers claimed. `` There is no philosophy which must be followed from here to eternity,'' a key economic planner, <PERSON> Somphavanh </PERSON> <PERSON> Inthavong </PERSON>, said in an interview. He explained that slowly evolving reforms were formally approved at the communist party's <ORGANIZATION> Fourth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in December 1986 and have gained steady momentum over the past year. Whatever changes the economic loosening may bring to the political arena, the <ORGANIZATION> Lao </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, as the <ORGANIZATION> communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION> is called, currently shows few signs of relaxing its grip on power or dismantling a watchdog apparatus which penetrates to the grassroots. The country's first national elections since 1975 are scheduled for mid-November following balloting at district levels. Officials say there will be more candidates than the 79 seats in the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> but all will be screened before being allowed to run. The major tasks of this and next year will be to finish the draft of a constitution _ the first under <ORGANIZATION> comunist </ORGANIZATION> rule _ and to substitute a legal system for the decrees under which the country has been run since the end of the <LOCATION> Indochina </LOCATION> war in 1975. Widely seen as the architect of change is <PERSON> Kaysone </PERSON> <PERSON> Phomvihan </PERSON>, the 68-year-old leader who is one of the longest power-holders in the communist world. He has headed the party since 1955. Although long regarded as a conservative, <PERSON> Kaysone </PERSON> has sharply criticized the system's shortcomings and opened some doors. Western diplomats say the bulk of re-education camp inmates have been released. Laotians are being permitted to visit refugee relatives abroad and Buddhism appears to be well tolerated. Although entry into <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> is still difficult, more Western journalists have been allowed to visit the country in recent months. <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> is closely bound to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, but <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> statistics show that unlike a few years ago about 60 percent of the $ 100 million that <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> annually receives in economic aid is now coming from the non-communist world, notably <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. Souphavanh, the economic planner, said the main socio-economic thrust will be to uplift the more than 3 million poor, subsistance farmers, including large numbers of ethnic minorities, in the rugged countryside. Few roads penetrate the provinces, electricity is rare and diseases rampant, with the infant mortality rate at 120 to 130 per 1,000 births, among the highest in the world. Officials indicate that a key measure of the new economic policy's success will be its effectiveness in spreading the relative prosperity now being enjoyed in <LOCATION> Vientiane </LOCATION> and the lowlands bordering <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>.

<DATELINE>HELSINKI, Finland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, allied perhaps only in the desire to help their husbands succeed at the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit, are expected to suppress their much-touted rivalry in the interest of a smooth session. But gossip-hungry summit watchers will be alert for any hint of a new round in the purported superpower catfight, be it an archly raised eyebrow from Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> or an extended lecture to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> press corps from Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. The two women have scheduled their first get-together for Sunday afternoon, as President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet Communist Party General Secretary <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> face off for the first time over a Kremlin negotiating table. Soviet experts predict the two women will strive to put aside their differences and display goodwill at a summit that may prove to be more show than substance. `` I suspect ... they both want to make sure that they do n't get in the way and that they do n't become part of the story in a negative sense,'' said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hewett </PERSON>, a specialist in Soviet studies and a senior analyst at the <ORGANIZATION> Brookings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Even though both women pooh-poohed the idea that they engaged in any form of competition at last December's summit, former White House chief of staff <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> offered a behind-the-scenes peek at their relationship in his book, `` For the Record.'' <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> writes that Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was peeved at the front-page attention garnered by Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s outspoken and fashionable style during the first U.S.-Soviet summit in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> in 1985. Irritated by Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s extensive conversation at their first dinner, Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> sniffed afterwards, `` Who does that dame think she is?'' <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> wrote. The former chief of staff also disclosed Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s predeliction for star-gazing in his book, a subject that Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> so far has not addressed or been questioned about and one that could dominate her early encounters with the media here Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is described privately by associates and <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aides as determined to try to squelch reports of any renewed disputes with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s wife during this meeting. Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` has always been a gracious hostess and has always been a courteous guest,'' said <PERSON> Shiela </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s former press secretary. `` You'll see that she will be this time, too.'' Ms. <PERSON> Tate </PERSON>, a public relations executive with <ORGANIZATION> Hill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Knowlton </ORGANIZATION>, said the first lady has always seen her role as an extension of the diplomatic process. `` She cares a lot about how she represents this country and so she'll do her best,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Tate </PERSON>. It turns out the two women will be spending a good deal of time together in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Besides the visit to the Kremlin Cathedral of the Assumption, they are scheduled to tour the <PERSON> Tretyakov </PERSON> art gallery later in the week. The president and Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will see their counterparts at the welcoming and departure ceremonies, as well as the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> state dinner and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> reciprocal dinner held at the ambassador's residence, <ORGANIZATION> Spaso </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> The most lengthy and private encounter between the couples will come after they attend a performance of the Bolshoi Ballet _ the <ORGANIZATION> Gorbachevs </ORGANIZATION> have invited them to dinner at a private country house, or dacha, outside the city. But it is unclear whether reporters will have as much access to the two women as in the December summit, when journalists were able to pepper them with questions during a nearly hour-long tour of the White House. Though the American couple is staying only five days in the Soviet capital, Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> plans to spend an entire day in <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>, an hour's flight away. Whether that trip was planned to alleviate some possible friction at this summit, neither the White House nor Soviet officials will say. Ms. <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> said she believes Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is well aware that it has been more than a dozen years since a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> first lady and president visited Soviet soil and is therefore intent on making a good impression with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> people. `` I've always said, while her husband represents the head of the country, she represents the heart,'' Ms. <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> said. A senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official who who spoke on condition he not be named, said the one-upmanship that occurs when the two women meet is n't surprising. `` The personal chemistry between the two women is n't good,'' he said, adding, `` I guess that's because they're much alike _ they are both strong women.'' <PERSON> Hewett </PERSON> said that compared to Soviet wives in the past, `` <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON>'s role has been a remarkable one,'' and that the couple has been attempting to show their nation `` it's time to enter the 20th Century. But he noted that Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has been the target of internal Soviet criticism for her high public stance and he predicted she will tone down the assertiveness she displayed in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> wants the -LRB- Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces -RRB- treaty, and other than that he wants an amiacable atmosphere at the summit to show that he is in charge,'' <PERSON> Hewett </PERSON> said, adding that the first ladies can contribute to that notion. On her own, Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is scheduled to visit a Soviet elementary school in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, where she's expected to try out the few <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> phrases she's been learning. Apparently stung by reports that she was not prepared for Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s forceful style and extensive knowledge of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history, art and political theory, Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> embarked on her own course of study. The first lady has read several books on Soviet history, culture, art and the Russian revolution, said her spokeswoman <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Crispen </PERSON>. She has also viewed several videos on the country, including one produced by <ORGANIZATION> Turner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> and a series on the country for <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America'' reported by the couple's son, <PERSON> Ron </PERSON>.

 A reputation for ruthlessness stuck to <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, because it seemed to explain something about him. He was the kid who lived to tackle in football games; the diligent young aide to Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>; the hound on <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffa </PERSON>'s trial; the designated S.O.B. in <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s campaigns; the `` carpetbagger'' senator from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>; the candidate for president who waited until <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> had led the way `` Reputation for ruthlessness'' is even in the index of an admiring biography by <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlesinger </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was also, according to <PERSON> Luella </PERSON> <PERSON> Hennessey </PERSON>, a nurse who worked for the family, `` the most thoughtful and considerate of the Kennedy children.'' In a Roman Catholic family that lived for politics, he was the one boy who might have become a priest. `` He's got high moral standards,'' brother <PERSON> John </PERSON> once said. <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> was the passionate one, the brother of the greatest intensity _ a brooding quality some found to be deeply Irish. `` My, he is unassimilated, is n't he?'' the poet <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> remarked after meeting him. <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> first channeled that passion into college football, then into service as an indefatigable aide to congressional committees and his brother's campaigns. Finally, bereft of the brother he idolized, he became a passionate advocate of civil rights and, after years of backing the war, an opponent of the bloodshed in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. `` <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> resembles me more than any of the other children,'' patriarch <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> once said. `` He had the same capacity for likes and dislikes, for love and hate.'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> was the seventh of nine <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> children, 10 years younger than <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and eight years younger than <PERSON> Jack </PERSON>. `` When you come from that far down,'' he once said, `` you have to struggle to survive.'' He was the smallest of the four boys, accident-prone and clumsy but determined to keep up. Unhappy at his slow progress in learning to swim, young <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> tried to learn all at once by jumping off a yawl into <LOCATION> Nantucket </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sound </LOCATION>, where he thrashed until <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> pulled him out. `` It showed either a lot of guts or no sense at all, depending on how you looked at it,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON>. <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stokinger </PERSON>, his football coach at <ORGANIZATION> Milton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION>, recalled: `` Bob -LRB- at only 160 pounds -RRB- loved to crunch. ... He loved to hit his man. And when he hit, he seemed to come alive.'' `` <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> was an all-out,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>, who took the young attorney along on a visit to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in 1955. `` If he was climbing a peak or hiking a trail, there was nothing else in the world to do but that.'' <PERSON> Schlesinger </PERSON>, author of `` <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and His Times,'' traces the reputation for ruthlessness to <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s campaign for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 1952. <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON>, the campaign manager, once booted a local labor leader out of the office, saying, `` If you're not going to work, do n't hang around here.'' When <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> decided he did n't want to wage a joint campaign with <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Dever </PERSON>, he sent his brother to deliver the bad news. `` Do n't give it -LRB- the joint campaign -RRB- to them,'' <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> told him, `` but do n't get me involved in it.'' `` <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Dever </PERSON> reflected after the campaign, which he lost, `` is the first Irish Brahmin. <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> is the last Irish puritan.'' <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> played a similar role in the presidential campaign of 1960. `` Inside the campaign he was the tireless investigator and goad,'' <PERSON> Schlesinger </PERSON> wrote, `` responsible for everything but the speeches. Outside he became the man to do the harsh jobs, saying no, telling people off, whipping the reluctant and recalcitrant into line.'' Well before the 1960 campaign, <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> had earned a national reputation as a relentless investigator. In 1952, his father arranged for him to work for Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, the crusading anti-communist who headed the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> had made the acquaintance of the <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> family after coming to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in 1947, and had won the admiration and support of fellow Irishman <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> made <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> an assistant counsel _ one of 15 _ to his young chief counsel, <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohn </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s major work was a report detailing that three-fourths of the cargos reaching <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> were on Western-flag ships _ this at the time <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> was sponsoring the Communist side in the Korean War. The committee's more famous work, the hunt for subversives within the government, was energetically led by <PERSON> Cohn </PERSON> and <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Schine </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Cohn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Schine </PERSON> claimed they knew from the outset what was wrong, and they were not going to allow the facts to interfere,'' said <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, who resigned from the committee after six months. At this time in his life, <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> made a disagreeable impression even on some friends of the family. <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Sorenson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON>'s speechwriter, found the younger brother to be `` militant, aggressive, intolerant, opinionated, somewhat hollow in his convictions. <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> returned to the <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in 1954 as counsel for the minority Democrats, resuming his fencing matches with <PERSON> Cohn </PERSON>. On June 11, in the acidic Army-McCarthy hearings, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cohn </PERSON> nearly came to blows in the hearing room in what one newspaper headline called a `` Hate Clash.'' Even after <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> was censured in 1954, <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> felt a personal loyalty to the Republican from <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>; in 1955 he walked out on a speech by <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Murrow </PERSON>, who had denounced <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> in a famous CBS broadcast. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> became majority counsel of the investigations committee, under Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> McClellan </PERSON>, after Democrats regained control of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 1954. First he went after <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Beck </PERSON>, and then <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffa </PERSON>, who led the union after <PERSON> Beck </PERSON> was convicted of tax evasion. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s pursuit of <PERSON> Hoffa </PERSON> was bitter and personal, on both sides, and continued when <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> became attorney general in his brother's administration. <PERSON> Hoffa </PERSON> called <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> `` a young, dim-witted, curly-headed smart-aleck.''

 In the <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> administration, <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> was not only the attorney general, but was also acknowledged as the president's closest adviser. That closeness was, in some ways, a union of opposites. `` <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was the more secure, the freer, of the two _ freer of his father, of his family, of his faith, of the entire Irish-American predicament,'' <PERSON> Schlesinger </PERSON> wrote. `` ... The two brothers had moved in different directions in adolescence and young manhood. <PERSON> John </PERSON> establishing his intellectuality, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> his toughness. <PERSON> John </PERSON> his independence, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> his commitment to the family.'' Devastated by his brother's death, <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> struck his associates as withdrawn, almost shrunken. He adopted his brother's habit of smoking cigars and began carrying around one of JFK's old coats. He read Greek tragedies and the work of <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Camus </PERSON>, and turned to an old passion _ football. `` Everybody was trying to get the hate and the anger out of their systems,'' <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinger </PERSON>, JFK's old press secretary, told <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> and <PERSON> Irene </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON>, authors of `` <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>: The Making of a Folk Hero.'' `` <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> was absolutely relentless,'' <PERSON> Salinger </PERSON> said. `` He attacked the man with the ball like a tiger, slamming, bruising and crushing, and so did everyone else. One guy broke a leg, and you could n't count the bloodied noses and contusions.'' <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON>'s own political campaigns were preceded by long bouts of indecision. He did n't announce his candidacy for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> until the latter half of August 1964, although he wound up winning easily. Because he was a Kennedy, there was always talk _ some hopeful, some despairing _ that he would someday run for president. He remained an enigma _ something the cartoonist <PERSON> Jules </PERSON> <PERSON> Feiffer </PERSON> ridiculed in 1967 as `` the <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> twins.'' `` The Good <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> is a fervent civil libertarian. The Bad <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> is a fervent wiretapper,'' the cartoon said, adding: `` If you want one <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> to be your president, you will have to take both ... for Bobbies are widely noted for their family unity.'' <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> wavered again in 1968 before jumping into the presidential race, days after Sen. <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> had run a close second to President <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary. `` It is hard to forgive <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> his shy, calculating delay in declaring himself, or forgive the shaggy rudeness of his final entrance,'' <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, even though he affirmed his admiration for the man. <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> worried in the spring of 1968: `` Do you know what I think will happen to <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON>? The same thing that happened to <PERSON> Jack </PERSON>. ... There is so much hatred in this country, and more people hate <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> than hated <PERSON> Jack </PERSON>.'' On the night he won the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> primary, <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> spoke for a moment with <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON>, a long-time <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> friend. `` You know, <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON>,'' he said, `` I feel now for the first time that I've shaken off the shadow of my brother.'' Within hours, he was dead.

 For those who loved <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and pinned their hopes on his 1968 presidential candidacy, the `` what-if'' game has become a form of catharsis. Twenty years after he was gunned down, they remember him as he was then _ a youthful 42-year-old heir to the political crown of his slain brother, President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. In his 30s, as his brother's attorney general and chief adviser, he had been thrust into the center of key issues of the'60s _ the civil rights struggle, the Cuban missile crisis and the Vietnam War. As a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> senator, he adopted as his cause the plight of the poor. And then he decided to run for president. `` What if he had lived?'' The question was asked at a recent RFK Remembered conference. And the answers came in a flood from those who had known him well. It would have been a better country, they said. There would have been no President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, no Watergate. The Vietnam War would have ended earlier. The poor would have had an advocate that counted. The young would have eschewed violence for peaceful participation in the system. Or is this just wishful thinking? One <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> family biographer, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Horowitz </PERSON>, says it was unlikely <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> would have become president and calls the speculation idle. `` It's fantasy time,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Schrade </PERSON>, the former <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> official who was shot with <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> on June 5, 1968, and who organized the conference. <PERSON> Schrade </PERSON>, whose skull was pierced by one of the assassin's bullets, recalled the moments just beforehand, as <LOCATION> RFK </LOCATION> thanked well-wishers after a speech: `` My own feeling when he was shaking hands was, ` We have a president. Then I turned and got hit.'' <PERSON> Schrade </PERSON> is not alone in believing <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> would have won and might have resolved some of the era's most troubling problems. `` No one can tell where roads not taken might have led,'' said scholar and <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> family intimate <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlesinger </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> `` Yet the likely probability is that <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> would have gone on from his victory in the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> primary to win the Democratic nomination for president and that he would have beaten <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> in the fall election.'' Such a presidency, <PERSON> Schlesinger </PERSON> said, would have saved lives by withdrawing American troops from <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> in 1969 rather than 1972, and would have slowed the nuclear arms race with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The minority view that <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> would have lost the election and would have had little impact on national policy is posed by <PERSON> Horowitz </PERSON>, who, in 1968, was editor of Ramparts, the radical magazine that spoke for the New Left. `` I do n't think he would have won,'' said <PERSON> Horowitz </PERSON>, co-author of `` The Kennedys.'' `` There was no support for <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> on the left. ... The -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> government was responsible for the Vietnam War. <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was dangerous from their point of view. The blood of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> was on his hands.'' <PERSON> Horowitz </PERSON>, who has since become an ultraconservative, dismisses the idea that <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was the lost leader who could have turned the nation on a new, idealistic course. `` <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was a complex guy and they've totally drained the reality of the guy for this romantic, symbolic view,'' <PERSON> Horowitz </PERSON> said. `` This is re-written history.'' Pollster <PERSON> Mervin </PERSON> <PERSON> Field </PERSON>, whose <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Poll has charted political trends for nearly 40 years, agreed that <LOCATION> RFK </LOCATION> is `` more and more glorified'' over time, but he's convinced that <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> would have defeated <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> and <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> for the nomination and <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> in the general election. `` You know, <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> was very controversial,'' he said. `` But he came of age in the'68 campaign and he had some special qualities.'' <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON> believes a Kennedy candidacy would have calmed the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> Democratic convention of 1968 and averted violent clashes between antiwar demonstrators and police. `` Part of me feels the emptiness of missed possibilities and always will,'' said <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON>, now a <LOCATION> Calilfornia </LOCATION> assemblyman. `` There will never be another <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. ... There will never be a time as poignant or important, but there is work to be done.'' Among those who see <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> as the nation's lost hero is <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Newfield </PERSON>, the Village Voice writer who began his book, `` <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>: A Memoir,'' hours after he had witnessed <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s shooting in the Ambassador Hotel kitchen `` I started to write it that night as therapy and catharsis,'' <PERSON> Newfield </PERSON> explained. `` <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s assassination is a wound that hurts more, not less, as time passes,'' he wrote recently. `` It was an amputation.'' With `` a conservative streak'' in his personality, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> would have forged a new coalition of liberals and conservatives in the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Newfield </PERSON> suggested. `` He would have helped liberalism shed its skin and become almost more contemporary,'' said the writer. `` It was certainly a lost possibility that will never be recovered.'' One of those closest to <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> in his final days was his special assistant for public information, <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Guthman </PERSON>, who acknowledges that a <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> presidency was not a sure thing. `` I do n't know that he would have won,'' said <PERSON> Guthman </PERSON>. `` The only thing you can be sure of is he would have gotten the nomination. That's pretty clear.'' <PERSON> Guthman </PERSON>, who helped edit a new book, `` <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> In His Own Words,'' said <LOCATION> RFK </LOCATION> would be remembered for his fight against organized crime, his civil rights work and his advocacy for the poor. He added: `` One thing that's certain is, had he lost the election, he would not have retreated. He would have stayed in there and fought for what he believed in.''

 The arms control treaty President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> came close to agreeing to in `` raise-you-one'' negotiations in <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION> is on the table again in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> _ still enticing and still elusive. But <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials do not expect <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to engage this time in impromptu, derring-do, head-to-head negotiating with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> of the sort they partook in at <LOCATION> Reykjavik </LOCATION> in October 1986. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> have been negotiating, off and on, since 1982 on a Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, known as START. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> proposed a 30 percent cut in both nations' stockpiles of long-range nuclear weapons. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> countered by proposing 50 percent. It looked for a moment like <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> might have a deal _ or at least agreement at the top on the framework for a deal _ when they met in <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s dream of a space-based missile defense system _ Star Wars _ proved too great a stumbling block. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> wanted testing limited to the laboratory. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> wanted real world testing. They could not agree and parted in disappointment. START went back to <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, where both sides have been negotiating. Now it appears too late for a START agreement. Soviet officials say more than 1,200 points of disagreement exist. The issue is awesomely complex, especially the question of verification. Strategic weapons can be delivered by bombers or missiles. Missiles can be fired from land, planes, ships or submarines. Land-fired missiles can be launched from fixed sites, or movable sites _ mobile missiles systems of which the Soviets have two and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have none. The two sides are unable to find acceptable ways to verify cutbacks in such easily hidden systems. Another issue is whether a START agreement would ban existing or future intercontinental ballistic missile systems. On top of that, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s Star Wars program remains a seemingly insurmountable obstacle. The Soviets want to restrict tests in space, and will not agree to cuts in offensive weapons unless they can call the reductions off if they conclude Star Wars violates the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty. `` It's now clear there is no way these questions can be shaped up in treaty form in time for the summit,'' Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said May 12 in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> after winding up pre-summit talks with his Soviet counterpart, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>. That being the case, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials do no expect <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to try to bridge the gap in face-to-face talks with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. At their first summit in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> in 1985, the two leaders spent time alone, in front of a roaring fireplace, and then walking outside in the snappy Swiss fall air. The informality of the arrangement, with only their interpreters present, helped break the ice. As they strolled back from a conversation in a garden gazebo, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> accepted <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s proposal for annual summit meetings. Apparently, that was the only time in their three summit meetings that one-on-one sessions produced a substantive result. At their second summit, in <LOCATION> Reykjavik </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was alone with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> for about 25 minutes, mostly discussing human rights. When they turned to the detailed issue of arms control _ and swapped proposals that escalated until it seemed there would be a breakthrough in the arms race _ <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> at his side. <PERSON> Reykjavik </PERSON> did set the stage for the treaty signed by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> last December in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to eliminate all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet intermediate-range nuclear missiles. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> were alone for about a half-hour. Again, the subject was human rights. In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, apart from the opening night dinner, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s program calls for two private sessions with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. The first will be in the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>, shortly after the president arrives from <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>. A <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> greeting is all that is anticipated. On <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s third day in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> they will be alone again. Even without a START breakthrough, there is much on the arms control agenda for them to discuss. They may sign an agreement under which each side would notify the other before testing a land-based or submarine-based missile, giving the place of launch and intended target. They may sign protocols calling for experiments to establish more thorough means of verifying two treaties that have been agreed upon but never verified by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> _ although experts believe both sides are adhering to them. These are the Threshhold Test Ban Treaty signed on July 3, 1974 and the Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty signed May 28, 1976, banning nuclear tests greater than 150 kilotons -LRB- more than 100 times more powerful than the <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION> bomb in World War II -RRB-. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, in a grand gesture, may announce the unilateral withdrawal of 50,000 to 100,000 forward-based Soviet troops in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in an effort to spur agreement on a reduction of both sides' conventional forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> Western experts say the Soviet bloc has a 2-1 advantage over the West in conventional forces. The Mutual and Balanced Force Reduction Talks went on for 14 years without producing agreement. Finally, the superpowers may agree on ways to bring about a worldwide ban on chemical weapons. Forty nations are negotiating at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Disarmament on a ban, but the talks are stalled over the intrusive verification measures that would be required to assure compliance. These weapons can be manufactured in ordinary chemical factories without attracting attention.

<HEAD>Reagan's Summit: The Gipper Visits the Evil Empire</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HELSINKI, Finland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s trip to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> promises to be short on substance but rich in symbolism: the Gipper visits the Evil Empire, the captain of capitalism vs. the ruler of communism, the great communicator co-stars with the media-savvy <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> chief. Over five days of talks in the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> beginning Sunday, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet Communist Party General Secretary <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> are not expected to produce the nuclear-arms treaty that they once hoped to sign in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Nor are they expected to announce any breakthroughs on other subjects. `` The headline of this summit is that there is no headline _ the summit that did n't bark,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sestanovich </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> staff member who runs the Soviet studies program at the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` This is not a high-water mark,'' said <PERSON> Rozanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridgway </PERSON>, an assistant secretary of state. `` It's sort of like catching your second wind.'' White House communications director <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Griscom </PERSON> said, `` Maybe we can get away from the fact that you only meet because you sign arms-control agreements because there are other things that are important too: human rights, regional concerns, people-to-people exchanges.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he even has some suggestions for <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> about ways to improve the troubled Soviet economy. If nothing more, the summit will move the spotlight for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> away from embarrassing controversies about the now-failed negotiations to remove Panamanian ruler <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, the conflict-of-interest investigations of Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> and unflattering portraits of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in books written by former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aides. For his part, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will reap benefits because the summit should bolster his prestige in advance of a rare <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> conference later in the month on his program of economic and social reforms. `` The visit allows him to demonstrate that he has been able to re-engage with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, with the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, that he has been able to produce from that dialogue agreements, such as INF -LRB- the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces missile treaty signed in December -RRB- ... that he can describe, as we do, a relationship which is now more predictable,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Ridgway </PERSON> said. `` Going into whatever meetings he's going into, that would stand as an accomplishment,'' she said. A senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government official said it would be a successful summit for <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> just getting `` the most conservative president in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history coming to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. In his public appearances in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> plans to offer encouragement for <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms and express hope for more. `` Broadly, what you hope will come out of it would be to recognize that the relationship between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has changed,'' <PERSON> Griscom </PERSON> said. `` The issues that we talk about are much broader now,'' he said. `` It's not just a narrow agenda. It's a full agenda and it ought to stay that way.'' <PERSON> Griscom </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s tactics should stand as a model for his successors. <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Sonnenfeldt </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> staffer, said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s visit has `` symbolic and political significance'' by the mere fact that it coincides with the withdrawal of Soviet troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. `` From the standpoint of this president, this coincidence of his appearing in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> while the world's television screens are full of Soviet forces leaving <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> ... is a kind of vindication of what this president said he was setting out to do when he started in 1981, which was to slow down the momentum of Soviet expansion,'' <PERSON> Sonnenfeldt </PERSON> said. The only thing that is guaranteed at the summit is a series of photo opportunties against carefully picked backgrounds. The news simply may be the remarkable nature of the event. Begin with the fact that no American president has visited <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in 14 years. Moreover, only three presidents _ <LOCATION> Franklin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Roosevelt </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> _ have ever set foot in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Four years ago it seemed likely <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would wind up as the first American president since World War II not to have a summit with the Soviet leader. Now it turns out he will have had more superpower summits than any other president _ four in just 30 months. It is a remarkable turnabout for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who earlier in his presidency called the Kremlin an `` evil empire'' and described U.S.-Soviet relations as `` a conflict between good and evil.'' A tough line of anti-communist rhetoric had been <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s trademark for four decades as he preached a gospel of military strength. `` Who would have thought in the early'80s, both in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> U.S.A. </LOCATION>, that it would be President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> who would sign with us the first nuclear arms reduction treaty in history,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> mused in an interview with <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said, `` Realism is an important quality in President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> ... By this I mean the ability to adapt one's views to the changing situation, while remaining faithful to one's convictions.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> held their first meeting in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> in November 1985, and set a goal of a 50 percent cut in strategic nuclear weapons and began a course of lowering East-West tensions. Eleven months later, they met in <LOCATION> Reykjavik </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION>, where they came close to reaching sweeping arms agreements but, instead, parted in anger over a dispute about the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Initiative _ Star Wars. They papered over the Star Wars disagreement when they held their third summit in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> last December. The meeting was crowned by the signing of the INF treaty. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> now considers <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> a real friend, despite their disagreements. He says the Soviet leader, unlike his predecessors, is not bent on world domination but content to see the superpowers live together in peace. In <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has a formidable rival, whose apparent self-confidence, media polish and style appeal to Westeners. In fact, Americans view <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> almost as favorably as they do <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, and the Soviet leader outpolls the president among college-educated Americans, according to a <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General-Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> survey. The leaders will get intense media exposure in meetings beginning Sunday and ending Thursday. In addition to talks at the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>, they will host elegant dinners for each other and attend the Bolshoi Ballet with their wives. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is not expected to jump out his limousine and wade into a street crowd, as <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> did in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. But the president has plenty of attention-grabbing events on his agenda. He plans to visit the <PERSON> Danilov </PERSON> <PERSON> Monastery </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to talk about freedom of religion. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also will meet with Soviet dissidents and `` refuseniks'' who are denied permission to emigrate. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is to have lunch at the Union of Writers with artists, filmmakers, intellectuals and others to discuss freedom of expression. In addition, the president is to deliver an address on U.S.-Soviet relations at <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and then conduct a question-and-answer session with students. He also plans a news conference at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. A room in the Kremlin has been reserved and time set aside Wednesday for the signing of any agreements, such as a minor pact on missile-testing notification, anti-cheating provisions for peaceful nuclear explosions and monitoring steps at nuclear test sites.

<HEAD>Quarterly Trade Figures Upbeat; Homes Sales Climb</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 The trade deficit is definitely improving, existing home sales are up and business failures are down, according to the latest batch of economic data. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday the nation's trade deficit narrowed dramatically during the first three months of the year as an all-time high in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> export sales offset a climb in imports. The trade deficit from January through March totaled $ 35.9 billion, a 12.7 percent drop from a deficit of $ 41.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 1987. It was only the second quarterly improvement in the deficit in the past two years and it represented the biggest decline since the deficit fell by 18.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 1982. The new figures confirmed an improvement that had already shown up in the department's monthly merchandise trade reports. The earlier figures showed a 16.4 percent drop in the deficit to $ 36 billion in the first quarter, compared with $ 43.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 1987. Wednesday's figures are smaller because they subtract factors such as shipping costs and military sales from the monthly numbers. The balance-of-payments deficit is also adjusted for seasonal variations; the monthly figures are not. In other economic news Wednesday, a major real estate trade group said sales of existing homes increased 4.5 percent in April, the biggest advance in 17 months. The group attributed the increase to a rush of closings in the face of rising interest rates. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION> said existing single-family homes were sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.48 million units last month, following increases of 2.5 percent in both February and March. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuccillo </PERSON>, chief economist for the association, cautioned that the sales pace could slow in the months ahead. <ORGANIZATION> Dun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Bradstreet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said business failures declined by 10.1 percent in the first quarter over a year ago due to an improving outlook for farmers and retailers. The business-information company said 15,211 businesses nationwide went under during the first three months of this year, compared with 16,924 in 1987. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, federal banking regulators said the nation's commercial banks appeared to be recovering from their worst year since the Depression despite mounting bank failures in the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION> and continuing problems with loans to Third World countries `` The banking system as a whole is sound and getting sounder,'' <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> The performance of farm banks is slowly improving as agriculture recovers from its slump, he said. <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> further noted that the nation's largest banks have written off big losses and now have `` adequate, if not comfortable, reserves.'' He also claimed the economy of the <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION>, heavily dependent on the oil industry, has hit bottom and is turning up.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> is a man obsessed with making deals. Before his record-shattering, $ 13.64 billion offer for <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday, the 52-year-old financier had already tracked, cornered and _ in some cases _ acquired some of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s most imposing corporations. There was <ORGANIZATION> Marshall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Field </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the retailer. And <ORGANIZATION> Chesebrough-Ponds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the consumer products company. <ORGANIZATION> Phillips </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> ACF </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> _ and on and on. His scrapbook of corporate raids reads like a <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's Register of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies Indeed, <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> is so well known in the takeover business, he says he was considered for _ but turned down _ a role in the movie `` Wall Street,'' which starred <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> as a vicious corporate raider. Always his own boss, <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> is a master strategist who recently described himself in Fortune magazine as `` obsessive in everything I do.'' Often reluctant to speak to the press, he is actually quite loquacious in person, people who know him say. `` I talk to him all the time. I mean, I listen to him all the time. There's a difference,'' <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. President <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinnear </PERSON> joked recently <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>'s involvement with <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> has been no laughing matter to <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s managers, however. After launching a slate of candidates for the company's board of directors and negotiating with <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> over the terms of a restructuring, <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> decided Wednesday to take matters into his own hands and make an offer to acquire the company at $ 60 a share _ in cash. It would be the largest deal of its kind in American history. Holding 14.8 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s stock, <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> had been pressuring the oil giant to put itself up for sale since it emerged from a 13-month reorganization under the supervision of a bankruptcy court judge. `` I've learned one thing: What counts is which way the tide is going _ on the last day,'' he said recently in describing his protracted battle with <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>. Whatever happens, it is generally agreed that if anyone could dislodge the status quo at <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>, it's <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, the man whose very name can send shivers through boardrooms across the land. He has made a reputation by buying up shares in companies with assets worth more than their stock price, then selling the companies off later, in whole or in pieces, at a highe price. Sometimes companies have agreed to buy the stock back at a premium to get him to leave them alone, a practice known as `` greenmail.'' Other times, as with <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> ACF </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> has retained a management role, but also has used the company as a vehicle for more takeover attempts. One way or another, <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> almost always walks away millions of dollars richer. To his critics, <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> is little more than a pirate in a coat and tie. But <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> says the real villains are corporate chieftans who are wasteful, inefficient and more interested in protecting their high-salaried jobs than looking out for the interests of their stockholders. That, more than the money _ which he does not need _ is what keeps him in the takeover game, <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> recently told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think there's no question there's a competitive force in me. But it's also a sense of outrage about the way companies are run,'' he said. Actually, <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>'s management has been paying off at both <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>, which he took over in January 1986, and <ORGANIZATION> ACF </ORGANIZATION>, a conglomerate he bought in 1984 and stripped down to its core railroad-car business. `` The guy is a deal man ... one of the toughest negotiators you'll ever see,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Pincavage </PERSON> of the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` We ought to use him against the Russians. I mean, this guy is good.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Farley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, one of the nation's largest privately owned conglomerates, is going after a major stake in <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Point-Pepperell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a major textile manufacturer which itself just swallowed a rival company. <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> announced Wednesday that <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> had filed with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> seeking permission to acquire between 15 percent and 25 percent of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, company's approximately 32 million outstanding shares Rumors have been circulating for several weeks that <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>, whose holdings include Fruit of the <ORGANIZATION> Loom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, was interested in buying into <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Pepperell </PERSON> said it did not know how much <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>, owned by <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>, already owned or what <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>'s intent is. However, <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> has filed no other papers with security agencies, meaning it has less than a 5 percent stake in the company. <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION>'s stock was among the most active in trading Wednesday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> as 1.2 million shares changed hands, with the price climbing $ 4 a share to close at $ 35.375. A spokesman at <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> headquarters would say only that <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> `` is a fine company and we think it's a good investment.'' <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> has $ 300 million available for acquisitions from a bond issue earlier this year, the spokesman said, but some analysts expressed surprise over the move because of the high debt carried by both <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> has about $ 1.4 billion in debt, and <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> owes about $ 1.1 billion after its recent $ 1.22 billion buyout of rival textile maker <ORGANIZATION> J.P. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stevens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` It did n't seem to make much sense to me when I first heard talk of him -LRB- <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> -RRB- buying the entire company,'' said <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Norwood </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C </LOCATION>. But she said <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION>'s acquisition of <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> will `` pay off in a major way,'' and `` if -LRB- <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> -RRB- is approaching this from the standpoint of investing, ... he's a pretty smart fellow.'' <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, an analyst with <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, said, `` We had been hearing the rumors that -LRB- <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> -RRB- was interested since the beginning of May.

<HEAD>Sugarman Apparently Loses Bid For Media General Board Slate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON> says he is not surprised he may have lost his bid to put three people on the board of <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, but that the 10.3 million votes his plan got should send a message to the company. <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON>, a California-based investor, launched a $ 1.8 billion takeover bid for Media General earlier this year. `` From the outset of the proxy contest with <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION>, we recognized that it would be an uphill battle,'' <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON> said Wednesday after the company announced that preliminary results from Friday's shareholders' vote show the incumbent management nominees won re-election. The returns show the three incumbents have received more than 56 percent of the vote, compared with 42.6 percent for <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON>'s proposed slate, Media General President <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, an election inspection company, told him the incumbents received 13.5 million votes and <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON>'s ticket of himself, <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Gotterer </PERSON> got just under 10.3 million votes. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said a final report on the vote will come after both sides get an opportunity to inspect proxies and raise any questions with <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON> said the shareholders who backed his slate `` cast their proxies in favor of enhancing values for all shareholders _ whether it be through our $ 70-per-share cash merger offer or another type of transaction. `` We fully expect that <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION>'s management and their board of directors will respect the opinion of this large group of shareholders and initiate action that will maximize shareholder value,'' added <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON>, who in his address to shareholders at Friday's annual meeting talked about the possibility of splitting Media General up into two or three smaller companies. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> told him that 86 percent of Media General's total outstanding 28 million Class A shares voted. The family of Media General Chairman <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tennant </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> owns 71 percent of the company's controlling Class B shares, which control seven of the 10 board seats. <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON> owns 10 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION>'s Class A holdings, and in February he offered $ 61.50 a share for <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION>, a bid he later boosted to $ 70 a share, or about $ 1.8 billion. Subsequently, he offered his own slate to challenge the three Bryan-supported directors seeking re-election to the board's three Class A seats. As the shareholders meeting approached, lawyers for both parties sought court relief from what they characterized as false and misleading information the other side was giving shareholders about the proxy battle. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> denied both parties' motions, saying the proper time to file them would be after the annual meeting. `` Any further challenge by the <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON> group is likely to come through the courts, where we have litigation already pending,'' <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said Wednesday. Media General owns several daily newspapers, including the <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> Times-Dispatch and The Richmond News Leader, as well as several weekly papers, television stations and cable operations. <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON> is chairman and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> Barris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a producer of television programs, and <ORGANIZATION> Giant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, whose holdings including cement businesses.

<HEAD>EEC Stops Imports Of U.S. Apples</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICHOLAS K. GERANIOS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>YAKIMA, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Reduced demand for apples, coupled with rising foreign supply, has prompted the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> to stop importing the fruit from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and some other countries, according to an <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman. The 12-nation European trading bloc imposed import quotas on apples this year and orth <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> _ which includes apples from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> _ reached its limit of 17,600 metric tons in late April, <PERSON> Ella </PERSON> <PERSON> Krucoff </PERSON> said. `` The reason -LRB- the EEC -RRB- thought it was an emergency situation was that consumption was down and imports were way, way, way up,'' Ms. <PERSON> Krucoff </PERSON> said in a telephone interview Wednesday from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> D.C </ORGANIZATION>. The quotas will remain in place until Aug. 31, the end of the current apple season, she said. `` This is a one-time thing,'' Ms. <PERSON> Krucoff </PERSON> said, adding that it was the first such <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> restriction covering <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> apples in at least 10 years. The <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> quota system has also banned further imports of apples from <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, a major supplier at this time of year, Ms. <PERSON> Krucoff </PERSON> said. That country's limit was more than 142,000 metric tons, she said. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state is the largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> apple producer, but traditionally has not had much success in cracking the European market. However, the nation had been enjoying a record export year to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> prior to the imposition of the quotas, said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. Exports to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> had jumped from 500,000 boxes last year to 2 million boxes prior to the ban, he said. A box normally holds about 42 pounds of apples. The ban's impact on total <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports will not be great, St. <PERSON> John </PERSON> said. `` Normally after the first of May exports really start to taper off because of the <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION> crop,'' he said. Still, negotiations are underway to allow for additional <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports to <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> countries, he said. The financial impact of the decision on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> apple growers is unclear, because apples destined for <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> countries will now have to be sold elsewhere, which could depress prices, St. <PERSON> John </PERSON> said. He called the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> quota a `` protectionist activity'' for the benefit of European growers. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state produces half the nation's supermarket apples, with this year's record crop expected to produce about 67 million boxes. The nation has also produced a record fresh market crop of about 130 million boxes this year. About 15 percent of the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state crop, or 10 million boxes, remains to be sold before the end of the season in August, St. <PERSON> John </PERSON> said, adding that most of those apples will go to domestic markets. The majority of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state exports traditionally go to <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> countries, and <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> said it was unclear if the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> ban would prompt increased competition with <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> for Asian markets this year. The <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> is made up of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Tenneco To Sell Oil and Gas Business</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH RENDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the 10th-largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> oil company, picked a favorable time to sell its oil and natural gas operations, analysts say. `` I think they see where they can liquidate some assets at decent values,'' said H.B. Juengling, a gas pipeline analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lobouisse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Friedrichs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. `` In 1986, the values just were n't there.'' On Wednesday, Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> announced it would be leaving the oil business by selling its oil and gas operations, concentrating instead on other industrial and pipeline ventures. The company would not put an estimate on how much the sales might bring, but <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaspar </PERSON>, an oil analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Robert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> W. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baird </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>, believes <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> has already courted some interested buyers `` I would expect they've had a nudge already, and decided to go public with the announcement to solicit other bids to make sure they will get the most attractive price possible,'' <PERSON> Gaspar </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION>, which posted 1987 revenue of $ 14.8 billion, will use proceeds from the sale to help pay its hefty $ 8.5 billion debt, <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said. `` The new <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> will be a financially stronger and more focused company,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ketelsen </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman and chief executive officer. `` With significantly reduced debt and capital expenditure needs, the company's earnings should improve materially, and its intrinsic value to shareholders will be secured and enhanced,'' he said. Proceeds from the sale also may be used to repurchase shares of the company's common stock, depending on market conditions and total proceeds from the sale, <PERSON> Ketelsen </PERSON> added. <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> has adopted a shareholder rights plan designed to thwart hostile takeover bids and prevent someone from gaining control of the company without offering a fair price to all shareholders. The oil and gas ventures being sold are from the <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary engaged in oil exploration, production, refining and marketing. In 1987, the subsidiary had revenue of $ 3.3 billion and operating income of $ 233 million. Its proved reserves of crude oil and natural gas liquids were 407 million barrels at the end of 1987. Natural gas reserves totaled 2.95 trillion cubic feet. `` While profitable, these businesses are not now providing adequate returns on past invested capital, and we do not believe their market value is fully reflected in <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> stock prices,'' Ms. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said. `` The sale will unlock the underlying value and provide us funds that will enable us to take advantage of growth opportunities in our pipeline and industrial businesses.'' The current mix of business in <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION>'s energy ventures make up 22 percent of the company's revenue, while all its industrial and pipeline ventures account for 78 percent, she said. After the sale, <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> will be comprised of 31 percent farm and construction equipment, 23 percent pipeline, 14 percent shipbuilding, 13 percent auto parts, 10 percent packaging and 9 percent chemicals. The businesses are: <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automotive </ORGANIZATION>, an auto parts manufacturer that includes <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> shock absorbers and <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> exhaust systems; <ORGANIZATION> Packaging </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, a major producer of paperboard, molded fiber, aluminum foil and plastic packaging; <ORGANIZATION> Newport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipbuilding </ORGANIZATION>, the largest privately owned shipyard in the world; and <PERSON> Albright </PERSON> & amp; <ORGANIZATION> Wilson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, a manufacturer and marketer of specialty chemicals and phosphates. <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> said the businesses together have achieved a five-year compound annual growth rate of 18 percent in operating income and have averaged 26 percent return on net assets employed. The shipbuilding and auto parts companies are worth an estimated $ 1.25 billion each. <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> also owns Case IH, the nation's second-largest farm equipment maker, and <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minerals </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Ketelsen </PERSON> said Case should be able to reap benefits from further upturns in the domestic agricultural equipment business. <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minerals </ORGANIZATION> is a producer of soda ash and gold. <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> also operates a <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pipeline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a 20,000-mile network of natural gas pipelines serving 26 states.

<HEAD>House Could Vote on Fiscal 1989 Budget Today If Compromise Reached</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: May be topped; also ran on general news wires</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Congressional negotiators have ironed out most of the details of a $ 1.1 trillion fiscal 1989 budget, and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> leaders are hoping the rest of the differences can be resolved in time for a vote today. Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, D-Pa., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday there were only about $ 150 million in differences remaining and that he anticipated a speedy resolution The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rules </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> cleared the way for the vote today with its approval on Wednesday of a resolution allowing immediate action on the budget compromise. Usually, the resolution has to sit for three days before a vote. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> leaves town at the end of business today for a Memorial Day holiday. Both the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> have passed budget resolutions that follow the outlines of last fall's deficit reduction agreement with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. That agreement spelled out spending totals for military, foreign aid and domestic agency accounts. But negotiators have been bogged down for six weeks over priorities within the domestic budget. The budget does n't require the president's signature. However, it serves as a guide for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in producing its 13 annual spending bills and any changes in taxes or entitlements that would require the president's signature. The $ 14 billion in new taxes for fiscal 1989 contained in the deficit agreement were enacted last December. The budget has to comply with the Gramm-Rudman balanced-budget law, as well as meet the budget agreement with the president. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration already has warned that the spending plans of the Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> might exceed the limits of Gramm-Rudman. If the administration determines that a deficit of more than $ 146 billion could be expected in fiscal 1989, automatic spending cuts would be imposed next fall to bring the budget into line. The budget already is six weeks past its statuatory deadline, and the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> has begun approving spending bills without the final budget outline.

<TEXT>
 `` Kiss-and-tell'' books may generate quick cash for former government employees, but job hunters could be putting the kiss of death on their chances if they complain about past bosses, experts say. `` If you have a grievance, the court to resolve that grievance is not in your next job interview,'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bies </PERSON>, assistant professor of organization behavior at <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Kellogg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday night `` Nobody wants to hire a complainer,'' <PERSON> Bies </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` Nobody wants to hire an attitude problem.'' `` Kiss and tell'' have become <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> watchwords of late. Former <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration aides from budget whiz <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Stockman </PERSON> to spokesman <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> to staff head <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> have penned books with what some consider embarrassing references to operations in the White House. <PERSON> Bies </PERSON> said revelations such as <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON>' disclosure that he made up some quotes he had attributed to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> made <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> appear less credible as a spokesman for any firm. <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> made the disclosure in his book, `` Speaking Out.'' After controversy surrounding the publication of his book this spring, <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> left his job as vice president of communications for the Wall Street firm of <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION>. `` Maybe the income from the book is enough to compensate,'' <PERSON> Bies </PERSON> said. But if <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> is a highly visible spokesman, `` You're always going to wonder if he's telling the truth _ is it <LOCATION> Speakes </LOCATION>, or is it the CEO -LRB- chief executive officer -RRB- that's talking?'' <PERSON> Bies </PERSON> said that discussing problems with past employers in a job interview, embarrassing or not, almost always sends the wrong message. `` I may say I want someone to be forthright and open,'' he said, putting himself in the employer's place, `` but most companies do n't really like that ... Nobody wants a whistle-blower. They want a team player.'' People who are willing to approach current bosses about problems are needed to keep companies on the `` cutting edge,'' <PERSON> Bies </PERSON> said, because they can point out performance problems that could be costly in the long run. But that does n't change the human nature of bosses' not wanting to hear about the problems, he said. Past problems should be framed positively in job interviews, with negative statements limited to things such as `` We had a parting of the ways,'' he said. A warning against employer-bashing was also issued by <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Challenger </PERSON>, president of Challenger, <ORGANIZATION> Gray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Christmas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a Chicago-based consulting firm which helps find new jobs for people. `` Sour grapes seldom win,'' Challenger said in a statement. `` No one wants to hire an individual who bad-mouths a prior employer.'' Such talk can also raise questions about a person's ability to get along with co-workers, an essential for productivity, he said. Job-seekers should also avoid unrealistic bragging, or indications that they may know better how to run things than their bosses, Challenger said. `` When job hunting, the employer is always right,'' he said. `` That means leaving your ego at the door when you go into the interview.''

<HEAD>Fireblight Threatening Yakima Valley Pears</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICHOLAS K. GERANIOS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>YAKIMA, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Fireblight has struck 60 to 70 percent of the pear trees in the <LOCATION> Yakima </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> and will probably reduce the current crop, officials say. The blight bacteria, which enters during spring bloom, has also infected trees in the <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Willett </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Yakima </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> cooperative extension office. `` It's a real disaster for those individuals that have to remove those trees,'' <PERSON> Willett </PERSON> said Wednesday. The infection will reduce the crop, but it is impossible to predict by how much, he said. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is the nation's second largest pear producer after <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, accounting for about 35 percent of the nation's production in 1986, according to state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> statistics The crop was worth $ 72.7 million to growers that year, the last for which statistics are available. So far 50 to 100 acres of pear trees, mostly eight to nine years old and just coming into production, have been destroyed in central <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> because of fireblight, <PERSON> Willett </PERSON> said. It costs $ 10,000 to $ 15,000 to bring an acre of pear trees to production, he added. Pears bring $ 12 to $ 15 a box. In most trees the infected branches can be pruned, reducing production but allowing the trees to survive, <PERSON> Willett </PERSON> said. There is no other treatment, and the infection period has passed, he added. `` You can spend as much as $ 800 to $ 1,000 a day in controlling fireblight,'' he said. The bacteria, which prevents widespread pear production in much of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, requires warm temperature at bloom time to enter the trees, <PERSON> Willett </PERSON> said. Spring temperatures in Central <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> are usually too low, but warm weather last month allowed the bacteria to multiply and spread, he said. Of the 11,000 acres of pear trees in <LOCATION> Yakima </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, 60 to 70 percent have some degree of infection, he said. To the north, <LOCATION> Chelan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, which has 7,500 acres of pear trees, has escaped the fireblight problem, although that area has been hit in past years, <PERSON> Willett </PERSON> said.

 The European Economic Community's economic sentiment indicator recovered strongly in March amid optimism about <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s economic prospects for the next year, the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday The indicator was at 103 in March, up 0.3 percentage points from 102.7 in February, and up 0.4 percentage points from 102.6 in November 1987 when the indicator fell steeply in the aftermath of the October stock market crash. The <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>'s economic sentiment indicator is made up of an industrial, construction and consumer confidence indicator and share price indices. The Commission said in a statement that expectations for the economy of the 12-nation trade bloc had brightened steadily since November 1987. It said the March indicator confirmed `` no signs of an economic downturn are discernible at the present time.'' By comparison, the <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said the leading <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> indicator improved `` appreciably'' in February for the first time since the stock market crash. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s indicator was unchanged in January. The Commission said that the improvement in the value of the dollar since the beginning of 1988 had strengthened export demand and made assessments by European industry of export orders less pessimistic.

 <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's third-largest grocery chain, has agreed with federal regulators not buy any shares of <ORGANIZATION> Lucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> until Saturday A 10-day waiting period following filing with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION>' $ 2.5 billion buyout bid for Lucky had expired Wednesday. However, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> asked the <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City-based </LOCATION> company not to purchase any shares of Lucky stock until after 11:59 p.m. EDT Friday so federal regulators could review any possible antitrust implications of the merger. In a brief statement released in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> by Executive Vice President <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> said the agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> does not affect the timing of its $ 65 per share cash tender offer for all outstanding shares of <ORGANIZATION> Lucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION>, which is scheduled to expire at midnight EDT on June 1. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> declined to discuss the development, saying they had no comment beyond the prepared statement. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Lissa </PERSON> <PERSON> Perlman </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Kekst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a public relations firm representing Lucky, indicated the delay was not considered a serious one. `` Things are progressing,'' she said of the buyout agreement. She would not discuss any possible antitrust concerns. American Stores and Lucky officials announced they had reached agreement on the buyout May 20. The deal terminated Lucky's April 28 deal to go private in a leveraged buyout led by the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> firm <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> van </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amerongen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 2.35 billion in cash and stock. Analysts widely have speculated that if <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> succeeds in acquiring <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>, Calif.-based Lucky, it will merge the company with its weaker <ORGANIZATION> Alpha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beta </ORGANIZATION> chain in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. In announcing the buyout last week, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> Chairman L.S. <PERSON> Skaggs </PERSON> said his company `` has always considered Lucky to be the leading supermarket chain in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and is enthusiastic about the combination of our Alpha Beta operations with those of Lucky.'' <ORGANIZATION> Lucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> has 480 stores and had $ 6.4 billion in 1987 sales, while <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> boasts 1,600 stores and $ 14.1 billion in sales. Since it defeated a takeover attempt last year by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investor <PERSON> Asher </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edleman </PERSON>, Lucky has been considered a desireable takeover target. In order to hold off Edleman, the company sold off its non-grocery divisions, plus stores in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> under a restructuring plan. The company also paid $ 2.8 million of Edleman's legal costs in return for his dropping the hostile takeover bid To break off its buyout agreement with <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON>, <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Lucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> agreed to pay the firm a $ 20 million fee plus expenses. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> offer, besides awaiting the outcome of the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> review, is subject to a majority of Lucky's 38.6 million shares being tendered. American Stores officials have said they have written commitments from commercial banks for all financing needed.

 Japanese construction executives Thursday called for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to lift its ban on Japanese bids for <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> public works projects now that a construction dispute has been formally settled. Japanese and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials signed an accord Wednesday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that provides for increased <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> penetration of the construction market here, smoothing over a 2-year-old dispute. `` We strongly hope that the office of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative will immediately reverse its decision to name <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> as one of those countries that should be subject to exclusion'' from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government-funded construction projects, said <PERSON> Hajime </PERSON> <PERSON> Sako </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Construction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Contractors </ORGANIZATION>, in a statement. <PERSON> Taichiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Kumagai </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Contractors </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, urged the Japanese government in a separate statement to internationalize <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s contract bidding process `` with a long-term perspective,'' <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> reported.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Rowntree </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, the British confectioner that is trying to keep two Swiss suitors at bay, on Thursday rejected a 2.32 billion pound, or $ 4.3 billion, offer from chocolate maker <ORGANIZATION> Jacobs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Suchard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Rowntree </PERSON> said the $ 17.77-a-share cash bid from Suchard, a Zurich-based candy and coffee group that controls more than 29 percent of <PERSON> Rowntree </PERSON>, did not fully reflect the company's value. Investors apparently agree. <PERSON> Rowntree </PERSON>'s stock was trading above $ 18.50 a share Thursday on the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The bid was the latest development in the battle _ dubbed in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> as the `` candy bar wars'' _ between <PERSON> Suchard </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Nestle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION> to gain control of <LOCATION> Rowntree </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Nestle </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Vevey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> and holder of a 16-percent stake in <LOCATION> Rowntree </LOCATION>, has offered $ 16.55 a share, or about $ 3.91 billion for the confectioner. <PERSON> Rowntree </PERSON> repeatedly has rebuffed <ORGANIZATION> Nestle </ORGANIZATION>'s overtures. On Wednesday, the British government cleared the way for <ORGANIZATION> Nestle </ORGANIZATION>'s bid by deciding not to refer the proposed takeover to the <ORGANIZATION> Monopolies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mergers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. The government also approved <PERSON> Suchard </PERSON>'s stake in <LOCATION> Rowntree </LOCATION> in the same manner but said a full bid by <PERSON> Suchard </PERSON> would need further clearance. Immediately after the approvals were announced, <PERSON> Suchard </PERSON> said it would seek Rowntree board approval for a possible cash bid or for other means of joining the two companies' confectionery businesses. The Conservative government's clearances sparked a row in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, where opposition politicians and some Conservatives attacked what they saw as the government's failure to ensure that York-based Rowntree remains in British hands. Suchard aggressively began building its stake in <LOCATION> Rowntree </LOCATION> last month, when it launched a `` dawn raid'' that took its holding to 14.9 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Nestle </ORGANIZATION>, saying <PERSON> Suchard </PERSON> forced its hand, then responded with a bid for all of Rowntree. But this did n't stop Suchard from increasing its stake further to just under 30 percent, the maximum it could hold under British takeover regulations without launching a full takeover bid.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy, helped by the biggest improvement in trade in eight years, expanded at a robust annual rate of 3.9 percent in the first three months of the year, far better than previously thought, the government reported today. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the gross national product, the broadest measure of economic health, performed far better from January through March than it had estimated a month ago. At that time, the department put GNP growth at 2.3 percent. About four-fifths of the improvement from that first estimate came from a narrowing of the foreign trade deficit, which shrank in inflation-adjusted terms at an annual rate of $ 16.7 billion in the first three months of the year. This represented the sharpest narrowing of the trade deficit since a $ 24.8 billion drop in the first quarter of 1980. The trade improvement had been estimated as a much smaller $ 3.6 billion last month, but that was before the government had data for exports and imports in March, a month when the trade deficit shrank sharply because of a record level of exports. Economists had been expecting an upward revision in the GNP report, but the 3.9 percent growth rate was far above most estimates. The consensus outlook had expected a GNP increase of 3.2 percent. `` The economy is on a roll. It is amazingly strong and resilient for such an aging expansion,'' said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON>, chief economist for the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON> said he was revising his estimate of growth for all of 1988 up to 3.5 percent, which would be the fastest growth pace since 1984 `` It looks like President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is going out in a blaze of glory on the real economy,'' <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON> said. `` The growth in the first quarter pretty much locks in a good growth rate for the year.'' The economic performance this year is far different than the fears raised in the wake of the stock market crash last fall. At that time, many economists said the country could well topple into a recession this year caused by consumer fears about the stock market downturn. The strong economic growth has buried recession fears for this year, but now financial markets have become concerned that the economy may be expanding so rapidly that inflation will be rekindled. But the new GNP report did not support any inflation worries. The revised report showed that an inflation index which measures prices of a selection of goods rose at an annual rate of just 1.7 percent in the first three months of the year, down from a 2.7 percent rate in the fourth quarter. It was the lowest rise in inflation since late 1986. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has predicted that the economy will expand at an annual rate of 2.9 percent for all of 1988. The government said that growth as low as 1.9 percent would be all that was needed to meet that forecast. Many private economists have been busy revising their growth estimates upward for 1988. `` If you take all the evidence that is available, you would have to come to the conclusion that the economy is going to do quite well for the rest of the year,'' said <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Albany </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The 3.9 percent January-March GNP growth rate followed an even faster 4.8 percent increase in the October-December quarter. But the fourth quarter growth masked some dangerous imbalances that were not present in the first quarter figure. Almost all of the fourth quarter increase in the GNP wound up as unsold inventories sitting on shelves. At the same time, consumer spending was taking a rare nose dive, falling by 2.5 percent, the biggest decline in seven years. That combination has often signalled an impending recession. But in the first quarter, consumer spending bounced back, rising at an annual rate of 4.3 percent, with about half of that increase attributed to stronger car sales. Business investment for capital equipment shot up at an annual rate of 32.8 percent in the first quarter, the fastest advance since the first year of the recovery from the 1981-82 recession. Analysts said much of the investment boom was directly tied to trade improvements as <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> companies have rushed to expand production facilities to meet the surge in export demand. `` Businesses apparently decided that the market crash would not affect them because they were depending on an export boom this year, not increased domestic demand,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, head of a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> forecasting firm. In another report, the government said today that after-tax corporate profits rose by 0.5 percent in the first quarter, a modest gain which followed a much bigger 2.6 percent rise in the fourth quarter. The various changes left the GNP rising by $ 37.2 billion in the first quarter, an annual level of $ 3.92 trillion.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> will meet the 27.5 miles-per-gallon fuel economy standard for its 1989 fleet rather than seek a reduction in the standard from the federal government, a <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> executive said. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> will meet the Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or CAFE, standard drawn up by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1975 by selling more small cars in 1989, said <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automotive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. CAFE is the average fuel economy rating of the vehicles each automaker sells in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> during a model year, which begins Oct. 1 and ends Sept. 30. That means that a company whose large cars sell better than its small cars could be penalized because its average fuel economy is too low. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lowered the standard from 27.5 mpg to 26 mpg three years ago at the request of <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's two largest automakers. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the third-largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> automaker, argued against the change because its fleet met the 27.5 mpg standard. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> had argued that low, stable gasoline prices had increased demand for larger and luxury cars. The companies threatened to cut big car production and lay off workers to meet the standard rather than pay stiff fines for selling the larger vehicles. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Automobile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Importers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, which represents all Japanese automakers and all but two <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> makers, have asked that the 27.5 mpg standard for 1989 be reduced to 26 mpg standard that was in effect for 1986, 1987 and 1988 models. <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> would break with the other automakers and added that <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> is continuously reducing the weight of its cars and engines. `` We're effecting change in that way and we also are using heavy marketing actions. We're selling every small car we possibly can to bring down the average,'' <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> said Wednesday. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> also will use credits built up in previous years when its fleet's average fuel economy exceeded the standards, he said. <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> was in <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> to present a quality award to the Monroe stamping plant.

<TEXT>
 Grain and soybean futures opened slightly lower today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, then turned mixed as some meteorologists offered drier weather forecasts. Analysts attributed the lower opening primarily to follow-through selling after Wednesday's sharp declines, especially in the soybean pit. Wednesday's losses were sparked by predictions for rain in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> early next week. But some of today's early forecasts offered a drier outlook, and bullish traders began buying contracts on any significant dip in prices, said <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Spilka </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.

<HEAD>Group Hopes to Build Interest in Energy Conservation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Several academic experts, consultants, governors, energy companies and advocacy organizations today announced the formation of a new group that will try to restore the notion of an impending energy crisis to the nation's consciousness. `` Energy policy has fallen off the national agenda,'' said one of the organizers of the group, Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinner </PERSON> of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, even though `` polls indicate that national leaders and the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> public are convinced there will be another energy crisis.'' The president of the new, Denver-based group, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>, said the group will try `` to grapple with conflicting solutions,'' such as the conservation-at-any-price vision backed by some environmental organizations and the expand-production-everywhere solution of some oil companies. `` There is no set agenda,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Beatty </PERSON>, senior vice president and <ORGANIZATION> general </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coastal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a Houston-based oil and gas producer. `` We are working together with people whose views we vehemently disagree with.'' <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Ebinger </PERSON>, an industry consultant and staff member at the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said the group had taken about a year to form, and the organizers had difficulty persuading some participants it was not just a front for oil companies.

<HEAD>Tentative Deal Reached To Kill Completed Nuke Plant</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES throughout with comment by Cuomo, details of

<TEXT>
 A utility today tentatively agreed to give up the $ 5.3 billion <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> nuclear plant for $ 1 and let the state dismantle it. It would be the first time a completed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> atomic plant was abandoned before it opened. Under the agreement, <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lighting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> would pay the more than $ 400 million to decommission the plant on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, 55 miles east of <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, but would be guaranteed 5 percent rate increases in each of the next three years. `` We have gotten everything we wanted,'' Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said at a news conference today. The agreement would allow financially troubled <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION> to continue to operate as a privately owned utility. The state had threatened a takeover of the entire company. Utility spokesman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Lois </PERSON> confirmed the agreement but withheld detailed comment. Once completed, the deal will end years of attempts by environmentalists, local activists and others to close <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION>, situated on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shore </LOCATION>. `` I think that utilities throughout the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will be very mindful of what happened to the <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lighting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> <PERSON> Like </PERSON> <PERSON> of </PERSON> <PERSON> Bay </PERSON> <PERSON> Shore </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> opponent and a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> LIPA </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, a board the state set up to examine a possible takeover of the utility. The plant, conceived in 1965, was completed in 1984, 10 years late and more than 80 times over budget. It never has opened because of the refusal of state and local officials to approve an emergency evacuation plan. The officials had argued that <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, because of its geography, could not be safely evacuation during a nuclear accident and without such approval the federal <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> had refused to issue an operating license. State efforts to close <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> accelerated after the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> in October eliminated the rule requiring state and local government participation in an evacuation plan. The entire agreement must be approved by the state <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, and some parts of it need the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>'s approval New generating plants would then be built on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> to ensure an adequate supply of electricity. The accord was announced 95 minutes after <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>'s midnight Wednesday deadline for an agreement. Earlier, <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> threatened to call off negotiations and resume a lawsuit to keep <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> closed if <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION> failed to agree to a deal. The settlement provides a prototype for opponents of other nuclear plants because it had been widely believed that once <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> was completed, it would be licensed despite state and local government opposition, said <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Holzer </PERSON>, an aide to <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Tese </PERSON>, <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>'s chief negotiator in the deal. The future of the plant has been in limbo for years and the delays in construction and the licensing effort, along with massive cost overruns, drove <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION> to near bankruptcy. In addition to fears over <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION>'s safety, negotiations have been driven by the fact that <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION>'s nearly 1 million customers pay the second highest electricity rates in the country, second only to neighboring <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION>. The utility's problems were highlighted after Hurricane Gloria in September 1985 knocked out power to more than 80 percent of <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION>'s customers.

<TEXT>
 Suits being filed nationwide against <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> have delayed payments of at least $ 500 each to owners of <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> cars sold after being test-driven while their odometers were disconnected. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's third-largest automaker, agreed last year to pay about $ 16 million to more than 32,000 owners but will not pay the money until the settlement is approved late this summer by <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Nangle </PERSON> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. Approval of the settlement has been delayed in part by continued filing of class-action suits against <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> nationwide, said <PERSON> Marcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Aud </PERSON>, <PERSON> Nangle </PERSON>'s deputy clerk. The suits must be consolidated and heard in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. So far, Aud said, 38 suits have been filed against <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> by owners and state attorneys general, `` and we're still adding new ones.'' <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> pleaded no contest last year to federal charges of odometer tampering contained in an indictment handed down in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. The investigation was launched in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> after state police noticed in several instances in which traffic citations were issued to <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> employees that the odometer read zero and speedometer was out of commission. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> stopped disconnecting odometers in October 1986 after learning of the government investigation. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> also extended the warranty on the cars to seven years or 70,000 miles from the standard five years or 50,000 miles. The warranty is in effect despite delays in the settlement, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said. Last July, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> said selling cars tested with disconnected odometers was `` dumb'' and that selling cars damaged during the testing went `` beyond dumb and reached all the way to stupid.'' All automakers disconnected odometers during testing at one time, but <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> halted the practice in the 1970s.

 <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> said its profit from consolidated, worldwide operations rose 63.2 percent in its latest fiscal quarter as revenue climbed 3.4 percent The automaker said its results were helped by increased car sales in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, cost-cutting efforts, successful currency hedging, and improved profits from non-consolidated subsidiaries and affiliates. <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> said it made a profit of 33.0 billion yen, or $ 264 million, in the three months ended March 31, which was a transitional quarter because the company is changing to a new fiscal year.

 Thanks in part to the new-found popularity of its 757 twinjet, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> appears headed for its fourth consecutive year of record commercial jet orders, industry analysts say. The giant aerospace company may be entering a sellers' market for aircraft, and an order announced Wednesday by <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> for as many as 100 of the 757s may be one of the last at bargain prices, the analysts believe. American said it was ordering 50 757s for delivery between July 1989 and November 1991, with an option to purchase 50 more for delivery through December 1993. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION>'s vice president for operations, declined to give exact figures, but said the deal was on `` very favorable terms for American'' with the firm order worth slightly more than $ 2 billion and the second 50 planes about the same. Today, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> announced it was ordering 30 757s, with options on 30 more. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> placed the value of his company's order at more than $ 2 billion. And 10 days ago, <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, ordered 100 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> jetliners and took options for 24 more. The $ 4.6 billion price $ 25 billion in 1988 orders was possible. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> Commercial Airplanes President <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON> on Wednesday acknowledged that 1988 could see a record, but said he felt uncomfortable saying <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> was on a roll. `` It ca n't keep up at this pace,'' he said. `` The past three years have been successive record years in terms of orders. I do n't think it can continue, but I would n't hazard a guess as to when it will end. <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON> said it's a coincidence that <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> is receiving large orders in quick succession. But <PERSON> Demisch </PERSON> and others say now may be the time to buy. `` We're moving toward a sellers' market for airplanes,'' <PERSON> Demisch </PERSON> said, adding that as orders continue to build, aircraft prices could rise by 10 percent to 20 percent. `` The desire to sort of get in before the gates close and prices go up is not far from the airlines' mind,'' he said. <PERSON> Nisbet </PERSON> said the recent huge orders may `` encourage everyone to hurry up and get their place in line'' for new aircraft needed in the 1990s. <PERSON> Demisch </PERSON> said `` American got a very good deal'' at a price of roughly $ 40 million a plane. Depending on configuration, 757s normally sell for $ 41 million to $ 47 million each. American's new jets will primarily replace its aging <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737s and 727s, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. The 194-passenger 757 jetliner, with a range of about 3,300 miles, burns 25 percent less fuel than comparable aircraft and will be powered by two Rolls Royce engines. The 50 additional planes, if ordered, would be delivered through December 1993. In an interview with <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> last week, American President and Chairman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Crandall </PERSON> said the airline could order yet another 100 757s by the end of the century. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> chose the 757 because of its economy, quietness, and because crews flying the widebody <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 767s in <LOCATION> American </LOCATION>'s fleet can easily switch to the smaller jet. Also, he said, more than half the parts in 767s are interchangeable with those in 757s. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> launched the 757 in 1978 as a high-technology, fuel-stingy replacement for its 727 tri-jet, which entered service in 1964. But a drop in fuel prices stalled sales, with just 239 757s ordered through 1987. `` I think most of you know that we've been probably a little disappointed with the 757 over the years,'' <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON> said. That's changed, with 90 of the planes ordered this year. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said the 757 makes sense with growing passenger demand coupled with growing airport congestion. He said the `` realization that those of us who are going to survive deregulation must begin the process of retiring the first generation of aircraft makes this airplane really kind of come into its own and be recognized for its merits.'' He said American was n't rushed into the order, but had studied it for months. `` You're betting your company when you buy a fleet of 50 or 100 airplanes,'' he said. `` You want to be darn sure you've looked at everything you can think of.'' <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> plans to increase 757 production at its <LOCATION> Renton </LOCATION> plant from four to five a month sometime next year. However, he said <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> does n't expect to need to hire many new workers.

 Writers will be able to reach their public by computer in June when a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> company introduces a way to browse through books electronically. `` We consider this the latest exercise of First Amendment rights,'' said company president <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Barcheski </PERSON>. The BookMart database will allow authors to reach readers without going through the grueling process of submitting and rewriting manuscripts for a publisher's approval. The database will also allow publishers to scan new books. BookMart is the brainchild of writer <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Bleecker </PERSON>, who along with two partners have formed PubTronix, based in <LOCATION> Pompano </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>. The on-line computer service will provide access to five pages of text and a book-jacket description of each volume for the price to the shopper of a telephone call. The author or publishing company, however, will have to pay $ 250 a year for each computer listing. After browsing listings by subject, author or title, readers can order a work by credit card and get it on a floppy disk, or in book form if it has been published, <PERSON> Barcheski </PERSON> said. PubTronix announced <PERSON> BookMart </PERSON> last weekend at the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> State Writer's Conference in an effort to attract unpublished writers seeking a forum outside the publishing world. `` In the next few weeks we will also be competing agreements with several publishers'' for listings, <PERSON> Barcheski </PERSON> said. <PERSON> BookMart </PERSON> will go on line sometime in mid-June with about 1,000 titles listed and hopes to expand to as many as 10,000 titles, he said. The on-line telephone number to <ORGANIZATION> RAC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Neck </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, will be advertised in computer magazines and on electonic billboards nationally when the start-up date is set, <PERSON> Barcheski </PERSON> said. In addition to books, <PERSON> Barcheski </PERSON>, Bleecker, and <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubinsky </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> RAC </ORGANIZATION>, plan to use the database to sell rare books, such as first editions and those carrying an autograph that would be of interest to a national audience. The men also intend to begin compiling magazine articles with <ORGANIZATION> RAC </ORGANIZATION>'s staff of 30. Eventually, the men want to offer BookMart in kiosk units to book stores as a way to boost selection without being buried in inventory, <PERSON> Barcheski </PERSON> said. `` With a BookMart listing, a publisher can effectively reach the home shopper and in the near future, the book store browser for a very low cost,'' said <PERSON> Bleecker </PERSON>. `` Publishers are, therefore, no longer required to distribute physical inventory to have a nationwide audience.''

 <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> today ordered 30 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 757-200 jetliners and took options for 30 more, giving <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airplanes </ORGANIZATION> its third multibillion-dollar order for aircraft in two weeks. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s firm order for 30 jets is valued at more than $ 1.3 billion, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> said. Deliveries of the jets are to be over a three-year period beginning in 1989. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> has chosen <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Whitney </LOCATION> engines to power its new planes, which will be outfitted to accommodate 192 passengers in two classes. On Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> announced it was ordering 50 757s worth more than $ 2 billion and taking options on an addition 50. On May 16, <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> ordered 100 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> planes and took options on 24 more, a deal with a total value of $ 4.6 billion, a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> record for a single order. `` It's been a very pleasant week, has n't it?'' <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Boynton </PERSON> said in confirming the order. He repeated <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s earlier statements that the new work would mean no new major hiring at <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s 757 assembly plant in the <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Renton </LOCATION> In <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> placed the value of his company's order at more than $ 2 billion and said <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> chose the 757 because of its cost-efficient operation. `` Our objective in returning to to our core business of running an airline is to grow <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and to establish it as this nation's pre-eminent airline,'' <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said in a statement. `` The 757 will strenthen our domestic network and with operating efficiencies that will enable us to compete more efficiently,'' he said. United will take delivery of its first 757 in August 1989, <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said. The delivery schedule for the first 30 airplanes calls for delivery of six in 1989, 21 in 1990 and three in 1991. Delivery of more 757s depends on the airline's ability to produce a consistent level of earnings, <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said. The 757 is a twin-engine, short-to-medium range jetliner and is the most fuel-efficient aircraft <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> builds. It also is designed to meet the most stringent noise and operational restrictions at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airports. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> has had 356 jets ordered in 1988 with an estimated value of $ 14.9 billion. That's just 10 fewer than the 366 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> commercial jets ordered for all of 1987. The value of 1987 jet orders was $ 19.9 billion, a company record. Industry analysts say <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> could be headed for its fourth-straight year of record orders, with some predicting a total of up to $ 25 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> has had 120 firm orders for 757s this year. Until recently, the plane was a disappointment for <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>, which only had 239 orders for the twinjet from 1978 through 1987. However, industry officials say the plane's fuel efficiency, larger size and availability in the early 1990s have brought it new popularity. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> said it would finance part of the transaction through the sale of its <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> DC-8 fleet to <ORGANIZATION> GPA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> GPA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Shannon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. The DC-8s are less fuel-efficient than the 757s. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>, which was started by <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> and three other companies in 1929, is <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s largest customer. With the new order, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> has purchased 528 jetliners from <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>, including all models the company has built. United and <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> severed corporate ties in 1934. The announcement came at a meeting at which shareholders approved a change in the name of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s parent company from <ORGANIZATION> Allegis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The company, formerly <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>, adopted the name <ORGANIZATION> Allegis </ORGANIZATION> in February 1987 as part of an ill-fated effort to structure itself as a travel-and-hotel conglomerate. The ensuing stockholder uproar forced the resignation of then-Chairman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferris </PERSON> and led to a sell-off of all of the company's holdings except <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>. United already has taken delivery of 22 737-300s, part of an order of 110 from <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>, and will begin taking delivery of 15 747-400s next year, spokesman <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> said.

 Grain and soybean futures closed lower Thursday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> with wheat prices down sharply on concerns about increased production next year. The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> approved a new wheat price-support program Wednesday that will allow greater wheat production next year, a prospect seen as strongly negative for prices, analysts said.

 Stock prices inched ahead today as the market absorbed the news of stronger economic growth in the first quarter of the year. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 2.89 to 1,964.26 by 3 p.m. on Wall Street. Gainers outnumbered losers by about 7 to 6 in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 706 up, 600 down and 579 unchanged. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said this morning that the gross national product grew at a 3.9 percent annual rate, after adjustment for inflation, in the first three months of 1988. That was up from a previous estimate of 2.3 percent.

<HEAD>Forecast: Crash to Cost Wall Street 26,000 Jobs by January</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Wall Street has lost 8,200 jobs since October's stock market crash and likely will shed another 18,000 workers by year's end, an economist said Thursday The report by <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> Professor <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Drennan </PERSON> was slightly more optimistic than his forecast late last year that the securities industry in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> would lose 28,000 jobs by the end of 1988 because of the crash. <PERSON> Drennan </PERSON> revised his prediction to about 26,000 because trading volume on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> held up better than expected during the first quarter of 1988. `` However, that support for employment is now crumbling,'' he said. Market volume last month was 17 percent lower than in April 1987, and so far this month is 12 percent off last May's level, <PERSON> Drennan </PERSON>, of <ORGANIZATION> NYU </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, said in an annual economic report. `` This pattern of greatly reduced volume of stock trading is expected to continue through the remainder of 1988. Consequently, securities industry employment in the city is likely to take another big hit,'' he said. Other reports have made similar forecasts. The state comptroller's office in December predicted the loss of 20,000 securities industry jobs in 1988.

<HEAD>Shoreham Abandonment May be First of Many Blows to Nuclear
Industry</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The tentative decision to close the $ 5.3 billion Shoreham reactor on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, may be only the first of several severe blows awaiting the nation's troubled nuclear power industry. An agreement reached early Thursday between the <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lighting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state would result in the abandonment of <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION>, which, though complete, has never generated commercial power. It would be the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear plant to be scuttled without ever operating. A similar fate may await the equally costly <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> nuclear plant in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. Like Shoreham, <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> has been embroiled in legal and political problems over the issue of whether residents and tourists in its much-traveled resort area could be safely evacuated in the event of a major emergency. Adding to <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON>'s woes is the recent declaration of bankruptcy by the plant's owner, <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION>. Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> recently said the bankruptcy filing may actually be a blessing in disguise, allowing a new financial package to be put together that could put <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> back on track. But many financial analysts doubt that, and Democratic presidential front-runner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who if elected would appoint a new <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, is foresworn to close the reactor. In addition to <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION>, more than a dozen other plants are in deep trouble. Voters in the <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, area will decide in June whether to close the long-plagued Rancho Seco plant owned by <ORGANIZATION> Sacramento </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Municipal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utility </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION>. The Pilgrim plant in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, owned by <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION>, will be the subject of a similar referendum in November. Rancho Seco and Pilgrim were singled out recently by an anti-nuclear group, <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizen </ORGANIZATION>, as the two worst commercial nuclear plants in the nation. The group, virtually duplicating a `` worst'' list put out a year earlier by the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>, also named 14 other plants as candidates for permanent shutdown. Among them are two Peach Bottom reactors in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, shut down by the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> last year after federal investigators found plant operators sleeping on duty, and several plants belonging to the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Authority </LOCATION>, whose nuclear program has been embroiled in a wide variety of management and safety problems. All five of <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION>'s operating reactors were shut down in 1985 for safety improvements, and only one, <ORGANIZATION> Sequoyah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unit </ORGANIZATION> 2, was allowed just recently to restart. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION> had to cancel plans to build eight other reactors, and construction, already under way, of four others was slowed. While <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION> hopes to restart all the facilities closed in 1985, the future of those under construction remains dark. The industry insists the overall outlook for nuclear power is good, if not bright. It points to an increase of 10 percent last year in electrical generation and an improved safety and efficiency record, in which sudden shudowns dropped to 2.7 per reactor, compared with 3.9 the previous year and 7.4 in 1980. But the fact remains that many reactors are candidates for closure, and no utility has planned a new nuclear power plant since the 1970s. Among other plants cited by Public Citizen and the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> as problem reactors are Fermi No. 2 in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oyster </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, three <ORGANIZATION> Browns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ferry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION> units in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Davis-Besse </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION> No. 2 in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vrain </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> and Byron No. 1 in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>.

 The dollar drifted aimlessly in light dealings Thursday and finished the day marginally higher against several major currencies. Gold prices edged downward. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> said gold was bid at $ 453.10 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, down from $ 453.75 an ounce late Wednesday. Foreign exchange dealers said the dollar was little affected by an upward revision of first-quarter figures for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> gross national product to 3.9 percent from the 2.3 percent reported earlier. Fears that the economy's strength would add to inflation were restrained by a companion report saying the annual inflation rate edged down to just 1.7 percent in the first quarter. The dollar declined slightly late in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trading session, but nothing nudged it out of the narrow range in which it has remained for weeks. `` We're anticipating it's going to be a pretty dull summer,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Chorek </PERSON>, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Money </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Market </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the British pound fell to $ 1.8625 late Thursday from $ 1.8650. Later in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, sterling fell to $ 1.8611 from $ 1.8631 late Wednesday. The dollar closed in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> at 124.50 Japanese yen, up from 124.30 late Wednesday. In later <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> trading, the dollar was quoted at 124.43 yen. At the end of the trading day in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the dollar rose to 124.58 yen from 124.42 late Wednesday. Other dollar rates in late <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trading, compared with late Wednesday's rates, included: 1.7086 West German marks, up from 1.7064; 1.4233 Swiss francs, up from 1.4238; 5.7565 French francs, down from 5.7583; and 1,267.75 Italian lire, up from 1,265.38; and 1.2364 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2427. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Wednesday's rates, included: 1.7080 West German marks, up from 1.7045; 1.4257 Swiss francs, up from 1.4245; 5.7620 French francs, up from 5.7550; 1.9125 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9090; 1,268.00 Italian lire, up from 1,264.50; and 1.2374 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2434.

 The rapid growth of <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which surpassed $ 1 billion in sales in record time, is expected to slow significantly because of a shortage of computer memory chips, officials said. Neither computer industry analysts nor <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> executives would estimate how big of an impact the chip shortage will have except to say that the company's growth will be less robust. `` I do n't think they will go backward, but they wo n't have that rapid growth rate of the past,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Greiner </PERSON>, marketing manager for the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> research firm <ORGANIZATION> StoreBoard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` To what extent they will be affected is still in question.'' For the first three months of the year, <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION>'s sales more than doubled over the same period a year ago, increasing to $ 439 million from $ 211 million. Net income rose to $ 47 million from $ 20 million last year. <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> is the world's leading manufacturer of portable personal computers and a leading manufacturer of desktop personal computers. The Houston-based company made <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> business history by being the first company to break the $ 1 billion mark in sales within five years of starting up. <PERSON> Rod </PERSON> <PERSON> Canion </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION>'s chief executive officer, said Wednesday that the company's second quarter sales would suffer because of the memory chip shortage. `` There will be some impact on sales, although it is hard to estimate how big it will be in the second quarter,'' <PERSON> Canion </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Canion </PERSON> said he does not expect the company's growth in sales and earnings to match 1987's growth rate. Last week, he told shareholders at the company's annual meeting that the rapid quarterly percentage growth would slow down. <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> will not be suffering from the chip shortage alone. Most computer manufacturers are scrambling for memory chips. Some other major companies complaining about the pinch are <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Microsystems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` The shortage will affect most manufacturers to some extent,'' <PERSON> Greiner </PERSON> said. Industry observers blame the chip shortage on several factors, including production cuts by Japanese semiconductor makers after the introduction of tariffs by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last year. The most serious shortage has been for dynamic random access memory, or DRAM, semiconductors, which are the most widely used computer memory chips. Japanese companies produce more than 75 percent of the DRAM chips sold worldwide, and some analysts say the majority of these chips are going to Japanese computer makers.

 Stock prices pieced together a small gain Thursday as the market absorbed the news of stronger economic growth in the first quarter of the year.

Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 187.85 million shares. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday morning that the gross national product grew at a 3.9 percent annual rate, after adjustment for inflation, in the first three months of 1988. That was up from a previous estimate of 2.3 percent. Many analysts had voiced concern earlier in the week that a stronger figure would reinforce investors' worries about a possible revival of inflation and upward pressure on interest rates. Rates rose in the government securities market following the news, amid conjecture that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> was tightening credit a bit further. But brokers said traders evidently concluded that the revision had already been taken into account in stock prices. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> accounted for most of the Dow Jones industrials' rise, climbing 3 -LRB- to 50.

 Students shouting `` Go Home Yankees!'' attacked an American bank with rocks and firebombs Thursday, and farmers protesting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agricultural imports hurled cow dung at police during a clash outside the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. Prime Minister <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyun-jai </PERSON> ordered a crackdown on violent protests and radicals, but the mandate seemed to have little effect on the wave of anti-American rage. About 30 students dashed out of sidestreets and hurled rocks and firebombs at a branch in southern <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> of the <LOCATION> KorAm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, police said. Police said four people were arrested. The bank, a joint venture between the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> and Korean business groups, was not damaged. It had not yet opened for business and had shutters over the windows and entrance. Riot police fired tear gas in front of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> building in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> to disperse farmers protesting plans to increase imports of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agricultural products. At least five people were injured. About 500 farmers, with two calves at the front, hurled cow dung and clashed with police after a rally attended by about 1,500 farmers. Police kicked and punched the protesters, who shouted `` Oppose American beef and its pressure to open the Korean market!'' One calf ran amok through 1,000 riot police surrounding the assembly compound. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is pushing <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to widen its markets to American imports. The trade issue has fanned anti-U.S. sentiment. The attack on the bank was the first on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> business interests in the wave of violent protests that have been aimed mainly at the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. A senior government official said Wednesday that the anti-American sentiment of the radical students is not shared by most Koreans. <PERSON> Hyun </PERSON> <PERSON> Hong-choo </PERSON>, minister of legislation, said: `` We are confident the majority of the people are happy with our relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' He was commenting at a lunch with the press about the recent unrest. Radical students blame the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for the partition of the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> peninsula and accuse <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> of supporting military rule in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>. They demand the withdrawal of the 42,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops stationed in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> under a mutual defense pact. The Korean peninsula was divided by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet troops that ended the Japanese occupation in 1945 at the end of World War II. Last week, protesters hurling rocks and firebombs attacked <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cultural centers in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> and in the southern city of <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> and hurled homemade bombs at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. Dissidents said Thursday they would continue the anti-U.S. campaign and called a major anti-U.S. rally in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> on Friday to mark the end of the eighth anniversary of a 1980 civil uprising in <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION>, where thousands of students and citizens battled police in daily protests. Dissidents contend the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> condoned the South Korean army's bloody suppression of the nine-day uprising, in which at least 191 people were killed. A 20-year-old student who had called for a full probe of the <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> uprising died in a hospital Thursday after dousing himself with kerosene and setting himself afire during a campus rally May 18. About 400 students shouting anti-U.S. and anti-government slogans staged a sit-in protest at the hospital in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> where <PERSON> Choi </PERSON> <PERSON> Duk-soo </PERSON> died. <PERSON> Choi </PERSON> was a student at <ORGANIZATION> Dankook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, suicide is sometimes used as a form of protest. In a Cabinet meeting, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> called for a crackdown against radicals and tighter security around foreign facilities. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said the recent protests posed a threat to the people and `` inflicted undesirable influence on the nation's security and diplomacy before staging the Olympics.''

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy grew at a surprisingly rapid annual rate of 3.9 percent from January through March, much better than previously believed, because of the biggest decline in the trade deficit in eight years, the government reported Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the gross national product, the broadest measure of economic health, was propelled during the first three months of the year by an export surge, a rebound in car sales and a boom in business capital investment. The report represented a sharp upward revision from an initial estimate made a month ago that the GNP grew at a more modest 2.3 percent rate in the first quarter. It provided fresh evidence that the economy has escaped unscathed from last fall's stock market crash, and it sent economists scurrying to revise up their growth estimates for the full year. `` You would have to say that not only was the stock market crash ignored, but the economy thumbed its nose at it,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dederick </PERSON>, chief economist of <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said he had revised his forecast to show GNP growth of 3.5 percent for all of 1988. That would be the fastest rate of growth since 1984. `` The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> years are ending with a bang. The first quarter GNP report shows an economy that is amazingly strong and resilient for such an aging expansion,'' <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON> said. All the good economic news is especially pleasing to Republicans in an election year when they hope <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will win the White House running on a platform emphasizing the peacetime record of 66 months of expansion since the last recession in 1981-82. The economic growth in the first quarter was a far cry from the recession that some analysts had predicted immediately following the Oct. 19 collapse in stock prices. However, economists now have begun to worry that inflationary pressures have begun rising because the economy is growing so rapidly. Those fears are present despite the fact that a GNP price index which measures a changing marketbasket of goods rose at an annual rate of just 1.7 percent in the first quarter, the smallest increase since late 1984. Analysts said this performance masked growing price pressures stemming from tight labor markets and the rising number of industries that are pushing against capacity constraints. Unemployment fell to a 14-year low of 5.4 percent in April. In a second report Thursday, the government said after-tax corporate profits rose just 0.5 percent in the first quarter of the year following a much larger 2.6 percent rise in the fourth quarter. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, senior economist with <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said the weak profit rise in the first quarter would add to inflation pressures as companies seek to boost revenues by raising prices in coming months. `` The inflation environment is deteriorating. The economy is growing too rapidly for stable prices,'' <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> said. Analysts predicted that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>, whose job it is to worry about inflation, will push interest rates higher to dampen demand. The central bank already has tightened credit conditions twice in the past two months. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Cappiello </PERSON>, a Wall Street investment adviser, said the fast GNP growth in the first quarter was adding to inflationary pressures and setting the stage for a recession next year. `` What -LRB- the GNP increase -RRB- reflects is light from a dying star,'' <PERSON> Cappiello </PERSON> said during an appearance in <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>. `` You're seeing the best growth in the economy. I think from here on in it will be dragged down by higher -LRB- interest -RRB- rates.'' But <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Sprinkel </PERSON>, the president's chief economic adviser, disputed that contention, saying there was no evidence of either recession or inflation threats in the GNP figures. `` We had an upward revision in real growth, a downward revision in inflation and greater strength on the exports side,'' <PERSON> Sprinkel </PERSON> said in an interview. `` These are all objectives of this administration.'' The administration's current forecast calls for GNP growth of 2.9 percent this year. With the fast start, the economy could grow as slowly as 1.9 percent for the rest of the year and still reach that estimate. About 80 percent of the improvement in the GNP report from the previous estimate came from a bigger shrinkage in the trade deficit than previously believed. The trade defict declined at an annual rate of $ 16.7 billion in the first quarter, the sharpest narrowing since early 1980, as exports, after adjusting for inflation, rose 20.7 percent while imports were up only 3.4 percent. The 3.9 percent overall GNP growth rate followed an even stronger 4.8 percent rise in the fourth quarter. However, that increase came almost entirely from a buildup of unsold inventories which was occurring at the same time that consumer spending was posting a rare decline. Growth in the first quarter was much more balanced, with consumer spending rising by 4.3 percent, reflecting in large part a rebound in car sales. In addition, business investment for capital equipment shot up a remarkable 32.8 percent, the biggest rise in more than four years. Analysts attributed this investment surge to the improving trade deficit which has sent <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies scurrying to expand production facilities in order to meet higher export demand. Analysts said they were looking for slightly slower growth of around 3 percent in the current April-June quarter due to an expected slowdown in growth of export sales, consumer spending and business investment from the rapid rate of the first quarter. The various changes left the GNP rising by $ 37.2 billion in the first quarter, an annual level of $ 3.92 trillion, after adjusting for the effects of inflation.

<HEAD>Cocoa Futures Plummet On Rumors Ivory Coast Re-Enters Market</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
 Cocoa futures prices plummeted Thursday on rumors that the <LOCATION> Ivory </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, the world's largest cocoa producer, had sold up to 100,000 tons of cocoa beans after a two-month absence from the market. On other markets, grains and soybeans finished lower; energy, livestock, meat and stock-index futures advanced; and precious metals were mixed. The <LOCATION> Ivory </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, an African nation that is world's largest exporter of cocoa beans, withdrew from the cash market more than two months ago because prices were so low. Prices subsequently rose more than $ 150, with the contract for July delivery of cocoa on the Coffee, <ORGANIZATION> Sugar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> settling Wednesday at $ 1,685 a ton compared with $ 1,507 a ton on March 15. Rumors Thursday morning that the <LOCATION> Ivory </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> had sold as much as 100,000 tons of cocoa to a consortium of trade houses sent futures prices tumbling as much as $ 100 during the session. The contract for delivery in July settled Thursday at $ 1,596 a ton, off $ 89 from Wednesday's final price. `` Everybody understood that as soon as the <LOCATION> Ivory </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> came out, the rally was going to end and we saw it today,'' said <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaul </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Philipp </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, one of the trade houses rumored to be among the purchasing group, would not comment on the rumors Grain and soybean futures finished lower on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> with wheat prices down sharply on concerns about increased production next year. The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> approved a new wheat price-support program Wednesday that will allow greater wheat production next year, a prospect seen as strongly negative for prices, analysts said. Mixed forecasts for weekend weather also pressured the markets, with most traders expecting significant rainfall before the end of the long Memorial Day weekend, said <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Spilka </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` The wheat crop is maturing and rain would be very helpful as the crop starts to ` head' out there,'' <PERSON> Spilka </PERSON> said. `` Heading'' refers to a critical phase of the wheat-ripening process. Soybean futures closed well above their session lows, an indication of the market's resilience to bearish news, he said.

 The nation's basic money supply fell $ 1.5 billion in the week ended May 16, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said the measure of money known as M1 fell to a seasonally adjusted average of $ 768.1 billion from a revised $ 769.6 billion the previous week. M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts and non-bank travelers checks. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said a broader measure of money, known as M2, rose $ 2.5 billion to an average of $ 3.002 trillion in the week ended May 16. M2 equals M1 plus accounts such as savings deposits and money-market mutual funds. The broadest measure of money, known as M3, fell by $ 300 million to $ 3.775 trillion in the week ended May 16, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said. M3 equals M2 plus less-liquid accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations of $ 100,000. For the 13 weeks ended May 16, M1 averaged $ 765.9 billion, a 2.9 percent rate of decline from the previous 13 weeks, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said. In judging monetary policy, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has indicated it is paying little attention to M1 but instead is monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the difference between short - and long-term interest rates It also has shifted more attention to the two broader money supply measures.

<HEAD>Boeing 757 Moves From Stepchild To Star</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE TIBBITS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 For years, the 757 had been the stepchild in <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s fleet: a plane highly praised but seldom bought. But in a flurry of multibillion-dollar orders, including <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' announcement Thursday that it was ordering 30 757s and taking options on 30 more, the twin-engine, medium-range jetliner suddenly is <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airplanes </ORGANIZATION>' hot item. `` It's been a very pleasant week, has n't it?'' said <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Boynton </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> valued the 30 firm orders at $ 1.3 billion. United did not give exact figures for the total order's value except to say it was `` in excess of $ 2 billion'' including planes, spare parts and engines. On Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> confirmed a long-expected order for 50 757s, valued at more than $ 2 billion, and options for 50 more at the same price. On May 16, <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> ordered 100 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> planes and took options on 24. The firm orders include nine 757s. With a value of $ 4.6 billion for the 124 planes, the order was a record for <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>. This year alone, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> has received orders for 120 757s and options for 80 more. In comparison, just 239 757s had been ordered from 1978, when the plane was launched, through 1987. In all, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> has had 356 jets ordered in 1988 with an estimated value of $ 14.9 billion. That's just 10 fewer than the 366 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> commercial jets ordered for all of 1987. The value of 1987 jet orders was $ 19.9 billion, a company record. Industry analysts say <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> could see its fourth straight year of record orders, perhaps up to $ 25 billion. At a Thursday news conference, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airplanes </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON> said the American order was a strong endorsement for <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> and for a plane he felt will be a mainstay for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines. `` I think most of you know that we've been probably a little disappointed with the 757 over the years,'' he said. But now, <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON> said, `` The 757 is fast becoming the new workhorse for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carriers because it answers the challenges of operating into congested or controlled airports where high capacity is desired'' without adding flights. The 757 was to be a larger, quieter and more fuel-efficient replacement for the three-engine 727, which was designed in the late 1950s and entered service in 1964. The 757 won accolades, but few orders, especially as fuel prices went down in the mid-1980s. Airlines seemed content to stay with the older, fuel-guzzling planes rather than front the $ 41 million to $ 47 million cost of a 757. Also, said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitlow </PERSON>, analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Dain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bosworth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, the hub and feeder-line route system airlines adopted favored smaller, shorter-range airplanes. `` The 757 was an airplane a bit ahead of its time in terms of our ability to assimilate it,'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION>'s vice president for operations, said Wednesday. But he added, `` the now-proven economics and operating characteristics of the airplane, I think, have been borne out.'' <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s 757s will have <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Whitney </LOCATION> engines and will carry 192 passengers. American's jets will use Rolls Royce engines and haul 194 passengers. Both versions have normal ranges of about 3,300 miles. Analysts and airline executives cite several reasons for the 757's sudden popularity: _ The airlines' older planes are requiring more maintenance `` It's just like a car, you can keep going forever'' with maintenance and repairs, said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Nisbet </PERSON>, analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` But there's a point where the economics do n't pay.'' _ The 757 is cheaper to run <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> says it's unsurpassed in fuel-efficiency, burning up to 43 percent less than a 727 and up to 33 percent less than competing twinjets. It also uses a flight crew of two, instead of three for the 727. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> also noted that 53 percent of the parts in a 757 are interchangeable with <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s wide-body 767, and that pilots certified for one plane are easily switched to the other. _ The 757 exceeds the toughest airport noise standards, said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>, chairman, president and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> The airplane industry may be turning into a sellers' market. <PERSON> Nisbet </PERSON> said production for comparable planes, including <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s smaller 737, <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION>' MD-80 and <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>' A320, is nearly all booked `` If you want an airplane delivered before 1991 ... you have to go for the 757,'' he said. <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Demisch </PERSON>, analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Switzerland </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said that as production fills up, airplane prices also will rise. `` The desire to sort of get in before the gates close and prices go up is not far from the airlines' mind,'' he said. <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON> acknowledged that <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> is on a roll, but did not think it could last. `` I just believe that things go up and down,'' he said. United will receive its first 757 in August 1989 and five more that year, <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said. It will get 21 more in 1990 and three in 1991.

<TEXT>
 Well-known corporate raider <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bilzerian </PERSON>, who frequently battles industrial titans, has filed a slander suit against a Little League officer. The suit, filed Wednesday in <ORGANIZATION> Pinellas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, charges that <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Brannelly </PERSON>, first vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Little </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, made false statements about <PERSON> Bilzerian </PERSON> that appeared in an article in the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petersburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday. The dispute revolves around whether the league met its 1987 fund-raising goal or fell short by $ 52.25 as charged by <PERSON> Bilzerian </PERSON>, who bought the <ORGANIZATION> Singer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in February for $ 1.06 million. In spring and summer, <PERSON> Bilzerian </PERSON> has coached a baseball team of 5, 6 and 7-year-olds and his <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> based firm, <ORGANIZATION> Bicoastal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has sponsored a team. In the newspaper article, Brannelly maintained <PERSON> Bilzerian </PERSON> failed to provide a matching $ 5,000 donation he promised to the league if it raised $ 5,000 on its own. <PERSON> Brannelly </PERSON> claimed <PERSON> Bilzerian </PERSON> `` welshed'' on the promise made before dozens of people, according to the Times. <PERSON> Bilzerian </PERSON>'s attorney <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Ingram </PERSON> was quoted in the story saying the league failed to meet its fund-raising goal and therefore <PERSON> Bilzerian </PERSON> was under no obligation to make the donation. Such statements by <PERSON> Brannelly </PERSON>, the suit alleges, have `` a tendency to injure <PERSON> Bilzerian </PERSON> in his office, occupation, business or employment.'' The suit seeks punitive damages in excess of $ 5,000, the minimum amount required to get a civil case into circuit court. <PERSON> Bilzerian </PERSON> was out of town and could not be reached for comment Thursday. <PERSON> Ingram </PERSON> was called but was not available Thursday. Singer spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> said only `` I think it's all pretty much in the complaint.''

<TEXT>
 The fuel tank collapse that caused the contamination of drinking water in three states stemmed from a dime-size flaw in the tank's nearly 50-year-old steel wall, <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. The 4-million-gallon storage tank collapsed Jan. 2 as it was being filled with 3.8 million gallons of oil, spilling more than 700,000 gallons into the <LOCATION> Monongahela </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and then the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. A combination of factors aggravated the impact of the flaw and caused the wall of the tank to split in less than a second, sending the oil over the dike `` like a skier going off a jump,'' according to <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Mesloh </PERSON>, head of a team from an independent research institute that investigated the accident for <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION>. The steel wall of the tank was first assembled in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> in 1940. It was taken apart and reconstructed at the company's <ORGANIZATION> Floreffe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Terminal </ORGANIZATION> south of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> in 1986 The original welds and the welds made during the reconstruction made the steel more brittle, said <PERSON> Mesloh </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> Battelle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbus </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. Other factors in the collapse were the relative weakness of World War II-era steel, pressure from the 3.8 million gallons of diesel fuel inside and the cold weather, he said. `` If you had a combination of these same events, it could happen again,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, firm. However, <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said, `` Once again, and I hope for the last time, we apologize.'' The flaw was in the steel before <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> assembled the tank near <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>. It was caused by a torch, possibly one used to cut the plate at the mill where it was made, <PERSON> Mesloh </PERSON> said. The flaw, a small, rusting cavity about one-eighth inch deep, was located near a weld about 8 feet from the bottom of the tank's 48-foot-high wall, said <PERSON> Mesloh </PERSON>, displaying the defective steel at a news conference `` It is likely that flaw would have been found by X-raying,'' <PERSON> Mesloh </PERSON> said. Hall also emphasized that similar fuel tanks are in use around the country and that the Jan. 2 accident could happen elsewhere, too. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> said there were about 1,850 major oil terminals in 1987, many with more than one tank, in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The institute does not track the age of tanks, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> has concluded that improvements are needed in some of the 1,000 large tanks it has inspected and has abandoned the practice of moving old tanks, <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said. The estimated 713,000 gallons of oil that escaped the tank's protective dike forced communities along the <LOCATION> Monongahela </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> rivers in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> to close their drinking water intakes About 23,000 suburban <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> residents were without tap water for almost a week. The accident spawned a flurry of legislation in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, including a bill that Rep. <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Walgren </PERSON>, D-Pa., on Thursday said `` would have required <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> to test the tank before using it That is not now required.'' <PERSON> Walgren </PERSON>'s bill would set standards for above-ground tanks with capacity of morew than 4,200 gallons. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standards </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> are also investigating the Ashland spill. Besides failing to obtain all the local permits required for erecting the tank, <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> said it failed to fill the tank with water, a test recommended by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. More than 4,000 claims seeking about $ 18 million in damages have been filed against <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION>, which says it is fully covered by insurance. <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> said it has paid about $ 7 million, including $ 6 million in clean-up costs.

 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> passed a $ 1.1 trillion federal budget for the 1989 fiscal year Thursday after negotiators from the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> solved a month-long dispute over domestic spending. The measure was approved by a 201-181 vote and sent to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, where it was expected to be accepted after that chamber returns from its Memorial Day recess next month. Twenty-six Republicans joined 175 Democrats in voting for the measure, which is moving toward its earliest congressional approval in years. The legislators, however, already have upheld their annual tradition of missing the April 15 deadline set in the law for completing the budget. The spending plan would satisfy the limits placed on defense, domestic and international affairs spending that were set in last fall's budget summit agreement between President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and congressional leaders. It also would avoid automatic spending cuts under the Gramm-Rudman balanced budget law later in the year by producing a deficit just under the law's $ 146 billion deficit ceiling. `` It has been designed bipartisanly, in good faith to avoid'' the automatic cuts, said <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, D-Pa. However, some lawmakers warned that Gramm-Rudman spending cuts could still be forced later this year if the economy worsens. `` We should be scaling back spending below the summit levels,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gradison </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ohio </LOCATION>. Under the law, the budget's deficit will be recalculated in August, and a weakening economy usually increases federal spending and reduces the taxes it collects. The last dispute that negotiators from the two chambers resolved was over new spending in domestic entitlement programs. In such programs, formulas in the law automatically decide how much money will be spent. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> wanted to increase that spending by $ 100 million next year and $ 1.3 billion over three years, while the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> sought a $ 500 million increase for 1989 and $ 2 billion more over three years. Under the compromise, such spending will grow by $ 375 million next year and by $ 2.2 billion over the three years, with most of it being used for nutrition programs for the poor. The measure contains $ 299.5 billion in new defense spending, $ 18.1 billion for international affairs and $ 148 billion for domestic programs for the next fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1. The amount for the Pentagon is an $ 8.1 billion increase over military spending this year, but below the amount that would have been needed to keep up with inflation. Education, health, social services and job training programs would all be given enough money to keep up with inflation. And selected other programs _ including those for AIDS research and treatment, anti-drug initiatives, space and air traffic control _ would get enough new money to surpass the costs of inflation. The election-year measure would allow an additional $ 1.4 billion in anti-drug spending to be provided later this year if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> decide that an emergency exists. The extra money would have to be covered by spending reductions in other areas or by new revenues. In legislation passed in December that enacted the terms of the budget summit, $ 14 billion in new taxes for fiscal 1989 already have been written into law. The budget approved Thursday includes no other additional revenues. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> passed its original version of the budget March 23, and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> completed its work April 14. The two chambers had differences _ small ones in budget terms _ over how the domestic spending was to be divided. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> sought $ 13.4 billion for space and science programs and $ 36.6 billion for education and job programs, while the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> wanted $ 12.5 billion for science and $ 37.6 billion for education. In their compromise, the lawmakers agreed to $ 13 billion for science and $ 37.2 billion for education. They also agreed to a 4 percent pay raise for military personnel and federal civilian employees to take effect in January. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> had sought a 2 percent increase for civilians and a 4.3 percent raise for the armed services, while the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> had sought a 3 percent increase for each category. The raise also would apply to members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, who already earn $ 89,500 annually. If included in forthcoming appropriations bills, members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would earn $ 93,080 a year, a raise of $ 3,580. The budget does not require the president's signature, and is used as a guideline by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> as it passes the 13 appropriations bills that actually provide money for federal spending. But this year, its value seems even more questionable than usual. While the <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiators spent six weeks trying to iron out their differences, the two chambers' appropriations committees began work on their spending measures. Thus, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> already has passed four of the 13 appropriations bills, while the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> appropriations committee has taken the first steps in writing its spending measures.

 <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday it agreed to extend its hostile $ 1.1 billion bid for <ORGANIZATION> Irving </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> for one week until next Friday. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said the company made the extension at the request of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. The court is hearing a suit <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> filed last week against <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> alleging the unwanted suitor violated federal securities laws when it amended its takeover bid to seek two-thirds of <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>'s stock rather than all of it. <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> claimed the company failed to adequately notify shareholders of the financial ramincations of the amended offer. <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> management is backing a friendly merger with the state-run <ORGANIZATION> Banca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerciale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Italiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SpA </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s second-largest bank. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> is offering $ 15 in cash and 1.575 shares of its stock for each of Irving's outstanding shares. The company is proceeding with its tender offer although it recently lost a crucial proxy battle for control of <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>'s board. As of last Monday, it held about 50 percent of <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>'s shares, including those it owned and those tendered to it. <ORGANIZATION> Banca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerciale </ORGANIZATION> is offering $ 80 a share for a 51 percent stake in <LOCATION> Irving </LOCATION>, or about $ 760 million. The bid is part of a complex restructuring plan that includes sale of Irving assets, several cost-cutting measures and a special $ 10 dividend.

 Higher electricity prices caused by scrapping the <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> nuclear plant could cramp <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> industry, already burdened by high energy costs, economists and industrialists said Thursday. `` No doubt about it, higher rates will hurt growth,'' said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Melkonian </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Hofstra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> economics professor. `` But it wo n't be the factor that brings <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> to its knees.'' <PERSON> Melkonian </PERSON> was a co-author of `` Project 2000,'' a report on the island's energy needs written for businesses. He noted that the <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lighting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s rates have increased more than 300 percent in the last decade compared with a national average of 195 percent and are already among the highest in the nation. According to Energy User News, a trade publication, <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION> has the seventh-highest commercial rates in the nation. For residences, the cost is 11.7 cents per kilowatt-hour, meaning a household that uses 600 kilowatt-hours a month would have a monthly bill of $ 70.20, <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION> reported. `` We are used to the high cost of energy,'' <PERSON> Melkonian </PERSON> said. `` The cost of energy in relation to the total value of the product output here is relatively small.'' Under Thursday's agreement to dismantle the never-used, $ 5.3 billion plant, the estimated $ 500 million decommissioning cost will be paid for by ratepayers over 10 years. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kessel </PERSON>, a state negotiator on the <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION> deal and Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>'s chief adviser on consumer issues, said the agreement would increase the average <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> resident's electric bill by a little more than $ 3 per month. <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION> would get a guaranteed 5 percent increase in rates each year for three years, and 5 percent would be the target increase for each of the following seven years. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> LaRocca </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, an organization of 2,000 companies, said that would mean a 63 percent total increase. `` This is a very expensive deal which has to be borne entirely by <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islanders </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. `` Our rates will be significantly higher when three other utilities in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> are in the midst of a multiyear rate freeze.'' `` We are already seeing the consequences of <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>'s decreasing ability to compete,'' <PERSON> LaRocca </PERSON> said A direct mail company recently fled <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and saw its electric bill plummet from $ 48,000 a month to $ 19,000 a month, <PERSON> LaRocca </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Grumman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Bethpage </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s prime contractor and <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>'s largest employer, expanded its facilities last year but did it in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, citing the high cost of energy and taxes on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. Grumman has 23,500 employes on the island. It pays $ 30 million a year for electricity. `` People with cheaper power can be more competitive in the market,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Harwood </PERSON>, a Grumman spokesman. `` The cost has to be passed along to the consumer and in our case that is the American taxpayer.'' <PERSON> Harwood </PERSON> found a silver lining, however, to the steady rate hikes planned: some certainty and stability, with companies able to plan better. `` Our overall problem is that we did not know what was going to happen with rates,'' said <PERSON> Harwood </PERSON>. `` Now we can plan.'' <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> has a thriving economy with one of the lowest unemployment rates in the country, a highly skilled and educated work force and one of the largest multinational business communities in the region. `` There will be a substantial impact on rates, particularly with those in the manufacturing industry,'' said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Cantor </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s director of economic development. `` But I think the rates will be absorbed without too much hardship.'' <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Prospect </PERSON>, deputy supervisor of the <ORGANIZATION> Suffolk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>, criticized the proposed settlement as an `` economic bailout for <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION>.'' `` The people of <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> wanted that nuclear power plant closed,'' he said. `` I guess higher electric rates is the economic tradeoff.''

 Striking television and movie scriptwriters claimed they had split management ranks Thursday after 64 producers, including the makers of `` The Cosby Show'' and <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Carson </PERSON>'s talk show, signed independent contracts with the writers' union Several of the firms that signed with the <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> produce successful television programs for <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Producers </ORGANIZATION>, representing the industry's biggest producers, downplayed the signings, which represent a significant break in the 12-week strike. The walkout has forced delays in the start of the fall television season and reruns of such shows as `` Late Night with <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON>'' and `` The Tonight Show starring <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Carson </PERSON>.'' The 9,000-member <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> was scheduled to vote Thursday night in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> on contracts with smaller, so-called independent producers. Voting results would n't be known until Friday, said union spokeswoman <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` We're anticipating ratification,'' Ms. <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON> said. `` We see it strategically as a good move at this time to break the logjam with the alliance.'' Ms. <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON> released the names of the independent producers and the terms of their three-year contract with the <ORGANIZATION> WGA </ORGANIZATION> before members gathered to vote on the proposal. The contract includes increases in foreign residual payments and provides writers with greater creative input. The list of 64 production companies includes the <ORGANIZATION> Carsey-Werner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>, which produces two of the most popular shows on television, `` The Cosby Show'' and `` A Different World.'' The makers of `` Tonight'' signed a contract and the producers of `` Late Night'' have agreed to a contract but have n't signed, said union President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirgo </PERSON>. Others signing were producers of `` Alf'' and `` The Muppets.'' Also on the list are <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Landon </PERSON> <PERSON> Productions </PERSON>, which makes `` Highway to Heaven'' and You and Me Kid Productions, the maker of the now-cancelled `` The Days and Nights of <PERSON> Molly </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>.'' Most of the producers appear to be film companies, such as <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gaby </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, and some, such as <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Keyes </PERSON> Productions, produce TV specials. None of the 217 big producers who belong to the alliance have signed independent contracts, management spokesman <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> said Thursday. The large producers, whose ranks include such big-time moviemakers as <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> and such TV giants as <ORGANIZATION> MTM </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON>, employ 80 percent of the industry's writers and supply 84 percent of prime-time TV, he noted. `` The alliance producers are holding strong,'' <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> said. `` This is all very, very interesting, but it has no impact on the new season or on the contract negotiations,'' <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> said. `` What they're talking about makes no change in the point of conflict, which are the deficits for productions of one-hour prime-time TV shows and the depressed market for those shows in syndication.'' Nearly 180 producers had discussed independent agreements, which meet the writers' demands on residual payments they receive when shows are rerun and for consultation on script changes made during filming, she said. Those are the main points of contention in the strike, which began March 7. On Monday, both sides sat down with a federal mediator for the first time since April 8. The talks at alliance headquarters in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Sherman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oaks </LOCATION> failed to produce agreement on any issue. Negotiators agreed to meet in small groups Saturday and set another full bargaining session Tuesday.
