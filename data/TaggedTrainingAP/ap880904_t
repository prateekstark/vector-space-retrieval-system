 The fifth tropical storm of the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> hurricane season lost its strength as it raced towards <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Azores </LOCATION> island chain, and its remnants were absorbed by a large north <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> storm system Sunday. Tropical Storm Ernesto, located roughly 400 miles north of the <LOCATION> Azores </LOCATION> near latitude 45.0 north at longitude 28.0 west, could no longer be identified late Sunday, according to a 10:30 p.m. advisory from the National Hurricane Center. Earlier in the evening, the storm had top sustained winds of 40 mph and was racing northeastward toward the <LOCATION> Azores </LOCATION> at about 50 mph. The <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> on the islands monitored the storm but chose to not warn residents Sunday evening, said <ORGANIZATION> Azores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Baiao </PERSON>. Meteorologist <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> of the Hurricane Center said <PERSON> Ernesto </PERSON> probably would lose strength when it moved over colder water. `` The storm draws its strength from the warm, moist tropical water,'' he said. `` Even a few degrees can affect the storm.'' Tropical storms have wind of at least 39 mph rotating around a warm core of low pressure. If sustained wind reaches 74 mph, the system is upgraded to a hurricane. If wind drops below 39 mph, it is downgraded to a tropical depression. On Saturday, storm warnings for the Gulf coast from <LOCATION> Cameron </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Apalachicola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, were canceled after a tropical depression dissipated several hours after forming off the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> coast. The first hurricane of the season, <PERSON> Debby </PERSON>, swirled to life Friday but was downgraded to a tropical storm hours later after moving inland at <LOCATION> Tuxpan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, about 165 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> hurricane season runs from June 1 to Nov. 30.

 Heavyweight champion <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> suffered what doctors called a slight head injury in an automobile accident Sunday near his training camp. <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>'s car apparently skidded on a wet road about 11:20 a.m., said a spokesman for the boxer, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Klores </PERSON>. <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>'s car was the only vehicle involved and the accident was not reported to authorities, said <PERSON> Klores </PERSON>, who gave no other details. A state police trooper said the accident was not under investigation. If the injuries and damage were only to <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> and his property, then he has 10 days to report the accident to the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vehicles </ORGANIZATION>, the trooper said. <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>, who was recuperating from a broken bone in his right hand suffered in a street fight two weeks ago with heavyweight <PERSON> Mitch </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, was taken to a <LOCATION> Catskill </LOCATION> hospital and then transferred to <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in nearby <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION>, where he was listed in stable condition early Sunday evening.

He arrived in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> shortly after 9 p.m. His wife, actress <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Givens </PERSON>, was in the back of the ambulance with <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> and tried to put a sheet over the windows to keep camera crews from photographing her husband. A few moments later, <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> was wheeled into the hospital on a stretcher with a sheet over his body and a towel over his face. As cameramen pressed forward, <PERSON> Givens </PERSON> pushed them back, shouting, `` Give him a break.'' <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>, whose championship bout against British champ <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON> was recently postponed until Oct. 22 because of the hand injury, was scheduled to accompany his wife to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> on Wednesday. <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, who lost to the undefeated <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> on May 20, 1986, in a 10-round decision, had the bridge of his nose split by <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> in the early-morning incident outside an all-night clothing boutique. <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> claimed <PERSON> Green </PERSON> was harassing him about their meeting in the ring. <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> said he reacted to Green by instinct.

 Emergency crews worked Sunday to find shelter for 50,000 people left homeless after two tropical storms whipped through coastal areas of both eastern and western <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, killing at least 10 people, authorities said. Rain from the storms continued to drench parts of the country and many areas were without power or communications. Mud and rock loosened from hillsides by the days of rain blocked numerous roads, officials in several states said. `` There is a lot of damage and at least eight neighborhoods are badly hurt,'' <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Porte </PERSON>, a public works official, said by telephone from <LOCATION> Tapachula </LOCATION> in the southernmost state of <LOCATION> Chiapas </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> coast. Authorities said 30,000 were forced to flee their homes after Hurricane Debby, subsequently downgraded to tropical storm status, hit the Gulf of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> coast on Friday. Most of the evacutions were in state of <LOCATION> Veracruz </LOCATION>, state government spokesman <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Torres </PERSON> said. Three people died when mudslides crushed two houses in <LOCATION> Papantla </LOCATION>, 16 miles from the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, and three storm-related deaths were reported in <LOCATION> Poza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, he The towns, on the coast about 150 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, were in the region that bore the brunt of the storm.

<TEXT>
 The death of President <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> ul-Haq </PERSON> could slow the spread of Islamic law in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, a cause he fervently advanced during 11 years as this Moslem country's leader. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>, an army general who died Aug. 17 in a plane crash, had made the `` Islamization'' of Pakistani society a pillar of his policy. But he faced opposition from some politicians, members of the middle class and others. With his death, the fate of a further expansion of Islamic law in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> is in doubt. Islamic law is interpreted with different stringency from one Islamic nation to another. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>'s Islamic laws included a ban on the consumption of alcohol, the provision of flogging and stoning as punishment for such crimes as drinking and adultery, and a 2.5 percent tax on the rich to help the poor. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> failed, however, to codify into Pakistani law <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>'s opposition to collecting interest payments on loans Punishment by flogging was rare, despite its presence in the legal code, and there were no stonings. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> was the most enthusiastic of all of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s recent rulers in applying Islamic law, said Professor <PERSON> Mahmood </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghazi </PERSON>, a leading scholar at the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> and the man who led prayers at <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>'s funeral. If `` someone not as enthusiastic as Zia'' takes over, <PERSON> Ghazi </PERSON> said, the pace of Islamization will be slow in this 98 percent Moslem nation. <PERSON> Ghulam </PERSON> <PERSON> Ishaq </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON>, the new president of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, and his caretaker <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> met a week after <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>'s death and pledged to continue Islamization. But nationwide elections are scheduled for Nov. 16, and that could strongly affect government policy. Opposition leader <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, who could become prime minister if her party wins the elections, has spoken out strongly against <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>'s brand of Islamization, saying no one should impose personal religious views on the country. `` There are some parties that are enthusiastic, and there are some parties that are lukewarm,'' <PERSON> Ghazi </PERSON> said. In May, <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> dissolved parliament, citing corruption, laxity and lawmakers' failure to promote Islamic law over a three-year period as justification for his move. He then issued a presidential order in June that decreed the legal code of Islam to be the supreme law of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and expanded court powers to review laws for conformity with the Koran, the Moslem holy book. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> was quoted at time as saying that `` Islam, like in the past, is again being used to perpetuate oppressive rule.'' <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> said the decree would not affect the rights of non-Moslems, or the country's business contracts with other nations. The order expires later this year unless reaffirmed by the government. Defining the relationship between Islam and the country's legal system has been a central question since 1947, when <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> was created as a home for Moslems on the Indian subcontinent. Many Islamic principles were enshrined in law before <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> came to power. But he sought to expand these dramatically, giving courts constitutional power to determine whether laws conformed to the Koran and the traditions of the Prophet <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>. Laws dealing with the constitution itself, judicial procedure and fiscal and personal matters were excluded from the review at first, but some of these exemptions were removed by <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>'s June decree. Although special courts now review laws for compliance with Islamic tradition, final appeals still go to civil high courts rather than to the legal bodies of religious scholars that exist in some other Moslem states. Many groups _ including much of the middle class and many lawyers and educated women _ have opposed Islamization, believing the country should not turn its back on educational and legal traditions from the West that have been in place since the British colonial era. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>'s policy also was coolly received by Moslems with different interpretations of Islamic law. For example, the jurisprudence of the <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> sect, which constitutes about 5 percent of the country's 107 million people, differs significantly from that of the majority Sunnis

<TEXT>
 The last survivor of what many historians regard as the last massacre of Indians in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history thinks returning to the site after more than seven decades may finally bring the scope of the tragedy home to her. `` It would be strange because I feel like I stand off from all of it,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Estepp </PERSON>, who was an 18-month-old child when taken from her dead mother's back after the ambush in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> in 1911. `` It's in the distance, you know.'' Though she is now making plans for the visit with friends, she lived most of her 78 or so years with only an outline of her past. Many details were finally supplied a few years ago by the author of a book about her grandfather, an Indian named <PERSON> Shoshone </PERSON> <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> who refused to live on a reservation. The ambush, by a white posse, left <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> and seven other Indians dead in the snow near <LOCATION> Winnemucca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, on Feb. 26, 1911, 21 years after the last major <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> massacre, at Wounded Knee, S.D. According to researchers, <PERSON> Shoshone </PERSON> <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> refused to settle on the Fort Hall Indian Reservation in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> and instead roamed the mountains near Twin Falls with his sons, daughters and grandchildren. The Indians lived off the land and worked for farmers, living in peace. But in 1910 one of <PERSON> Mike </PERSON>'s sons was killed by a white horse thief, and the family retaliated by killing the killer. Not trusting white justice, <PERSON> Shoshone </PERSON> <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> took his family and fled into <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>. The 12 Indians survived a brutal winter by stealing cattle for food. When four ranchers discovered the loss, the Indians killed them and took their horses. Posses from <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> pursued the Indians for 300 miles until Feb. 26, when they caught the ragged band sleeping and slaughtered four men, two women and two boys during a brief battle. One posse member was killed. The four surviving children were put in the <PERSON> Reno </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, jail because there was no place else to put them. In his 1973 book about <PERSON> Shoshone </PERSON> <PERSON> Mike </PERSON>, titled `` The Last Free Man,'' author <PERSON> Dayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON> noted the four surviving children, but he was unable to find out what happened to them. A friend of Ms. <PERSON> Estep </PERSON> contacted <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON> after reading his book, and <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON> traveled to her home in <LOCATION> Yakima </LOCATION>. There is still much Ms. <PERSON> Estep </PERSON> does n't know about the time before she was lifted from that blood-soaked cradleboard after falling face-down in the snow. The identity of her father is unclear, as is her age and whether she was born a Shoshone or a Bannock Indian. Still, she said, `` They know my mother was one of Shoshone <PERSON> Mike </PERSON>'s daughters. Her name was Snake.'' The massacre in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> appears to have been the last of its kind in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergon </PERSON>, a professor of Native American cultures at <ORGANIZATION> Vassar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Poughkeepsie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, whose novel, `` Shoshone <PERSON> Mike </PERSON>,'' was recently published by <PERSON> Viking </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON> agrees. Many massacres of whites and Indians occurred in the 19th century. `` What makes this significant is it occurred in 1911, when there were automobiles, airplanes and movies,'' <PERSON> Bergon </PERSON> said. `` The fact that it did occur in the 20th century makes the whole thing surreal.'' After the massacre, the federal government ordered <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Estep </PERSON>, then the superintendent of the <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reservation </ORGANIZATION>, to pick up the children. Ms. <PERSON> Estep </PERSON>'s memories begin with the train trip north in November 1911. `` I remember when we went to the dining car I would n't eat the food,'' she said. The exception was raisins in the raisin bread, which tided her over. They may have reminded her of food her family ate, but she is n't sure. The other three children died of illnesses within a year. The toddler survived tuberculosis and was adopted by <PERSON> Estep </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Rita </PERSON>, who were childless. They guessed she was about 18 months old when she was found. She moved with the family to reservations in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, finally settling at <LOCATION> Toppenish </LOCATION> on the <ORGANIZATION> Yakima </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reservation </ORGANIZATION> in 1924. Although her adoptive parents told her about the massacre, she never asked for details and they never talked much about <PERSON> Shoshone </PERSON> <PERSON> Mike </PERSON>, she said. She was treated as a white person and noted, `` Most of my friends are non-Indians.'' The family moved to <LOCATION> Yakima </LOCATION> in 1930, after <PERSON> Estep </PERSON> retired. Ms. <PERSON> Estep </PERSON> still lives in the house purchased by her adoptive parents, who died in the 1950s. She graduated from <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> with a music degree and spent 40 years teaching school before retiring in 1974. She never married. Her only tangible link with her Indian past is a single black-and-white photograph of the four surviving children taken in front of the Reno jail. It shows the children she had thought were siblings until <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON> identified them: an aunt, <PERSON> Hattie </PERSON>, age about 4; an uncle, <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, about 7; and another aunt, <PERSON> Heney </PERSON>, who appears to be about 18. And, of course, the haunting photo shows herself, wearing a white hat and crying.

 A tropical storm watch for the Hawaiian islands was discontinued but high surf advisories were in effect as Hurricane Uleki moved away from the state, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. At 2 p.m. Sunday, or 8 p.m. EDT, the hurricane was 385 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> and 350 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Lihue </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kauai </LOCATION>, moving to the west at 12 mph with maximum sustained winds of 80 mph and gusts to 100 mph, meteorologist <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Uleki </PERSON>'s westward movement lessened the threat of damaging winds for <LOCATION> Oahu </LOCATION>, where <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> is located, <LOCATION> Kauai </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Niihau </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said. However, a high surf advisory remained in effect for all southern coasts that were pounded by large waves from the storm. Rescuers assisted 19 people Saturday in 5 - to 6-foot waves off <LOCATION> Waikiki </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> and nearby <LOCATION> Ala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, according to lifeguard Capt <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON>. A body was discovered Sunday off <LOCATION> Maunalua </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> eight miles east of <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>, but it was not immediately known if the death was related to the storm, police said. <PERSON> Uleki </PERSON> was expected to continue moving westward, and gradually weaken to the point where it could be downgraded from hurricane status this afternoon, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said. When the storm took an unexpected turn toward the islands Friday, winds near the center gusted to 150 mph. Uleki is Hawaiian for <PERSON> Ulysses </PERSON>. The weather service in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> said the <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> region has its own list of Hawaiian names for storms in the region. Next will be <PERSON> Wila </PERSON>, followed by <LOCATION> Aka </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ekeka </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hale </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 Utility crews finally restored service Saturday night to parts of a 50-block downtown section that had been without electricity since the middle of the week. But <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> City Light officials asked customers not to turn on their air conditioning immediately, out of fear of a surge of demand on one of the hottest days of the year. The temperature in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> hit 92 degrees, a record for the date, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. About half of the blacked-out area's customers got electricity back when four cables feeding power to the area were reactivated about 6:45 p.m. PDT, power company spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Aguirre </PERSON> said. All the customers were expected to be back on line when two other feeder cables are repaired and in place Sunday or Monday, <PERSON> Aguirre </PERSON> said. Restrictions on power use also were expected to end then, he said. An initial attempt to energize the cables was unsuccessful when one of them refused to take power and tripped a circuit breaker. The reason for the problem was not immediately known, <PERSON> Aguirre </PERSON> said. Earlier in the day, the outage had officials worried about fires and the effect of the heat on the elderly. `` We're keeping an eye on the heat situation, and we're on alert to evacuate people'' from housing for the elderly, said <PERSON> Hope </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuttle </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Seattle-King </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman. The high temperature Friday at <LOCATION> Seattle-Tacoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> was a September record of 98, one degree below the all-time record for that recording station, and a similar reading was forecast Saturday. Since power was lost in a transformer fire Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> had been serving three meals a day to 150 to 250 elderly residents. Volunteers had to take some meals up 13 flights of stairs in buildings where elevators were inoperative. Street lights, but almost no traffic signals, came on for the first time Friday night when temporary overhead wiring was hooked into the lighting system. Repair crews hoped to begin restoring power late Saturday in a complex process that would `` likely extend into Monday,'' said City Light spokesman <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Forslund </PERSON>. Thirty buildings with the largest loads in the area and more than 90 others with emergency generators would remain off the system when power is restored, <PERSON> Forslund </PERSON> said. When the switch is thrown, <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Light </ORGANIZATION> engineers plan to wait two to four hours to assure that the system is stabilized before restoring service to the remaining buildings. The area typically accounts for roughly 3 percent of the city's 1,000-megawatt load. If too much equipment is turned on when the switch is thrown, the sudden added load would cause an abrupt voltage dip, or sag, said <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> McIntosh </PERSON>, chief spokesman for City Light. `` It would be like halftime during a ball game when everyone flushes all the toilets and the water pressure drops,'' he said. A severe sag could trip current-monitoring equipment and trigger another blackout. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, spokesman for the Fire Department, estimated 90 percent of the affected businesses were closed. An office of Great Northwest Federal Savings and Loan remained open, but with reduced operations. Customers' identifications were checked before they were let into the building, two at a time, to withdraw money for the weekend. `` This is banking the way it used to be,'' said <PERSON> Dianne </PERSON> <PERSON> Backus </PERSON>, division manager. `` We're taking down every transaction by hand and every couple of hours run to one of our branches and enter everything into the computer.'' Fire alarm systems were checked regularly, as were residential hotels where officials feared guests might use candles or gas camping stoves. `` Frankly, this situation is new to us, and we're a little nervous,'' said <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>. `` We've got several cars patrolling just to look for fires.'' No injuries were reported during the blackout, and heavy police patrols were credited with preventing break-ins. By Friday many hotel guests had wearied of the novelty of being issued complimentary flashlights and complained of 15-story climbs up stairways. `` I began to notice a little soreness in my calves yesterday,'' said <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Eaton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, a guest at the 40-story Westin Hotel's south tower, which had one of three elevators in service. <PERSON> Westin </PERSON> officials tried to accommodate most guests in the hotel's 47-story north tower, which had air conditioning It was another matter entirely for <PERSON> Viola </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, 83, pausing on the ninth-floor landing in the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, two floors from where she lives. `` I stop ... every floor ... and rest,'' she panted. `` Have to or I ca n't make it. Takes me half an hour to get up. `` It's horrible, but some of my neighbors have n't been out of their apartments all week.''

He was 65. <PERSON> Watts </PERSON> died at his farm in <LOCATION> Martins </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> after a long bout with lung cancer, according to a longtime friend and former student, <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. <PERSON> Watts </PERSON> was planning a solo exhibition of his recent work at the time of his death, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Watts </PERSON>' mixed media works appeared in museums and galleries in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. In 1946, <PERSON> Watts </PERSON> painted in the tradition of abstract expressionism, but 12 years later, he stopped painting and began working with a variety of media, including sculpture, film, video and performance work. In the early 1960s, he was one of the artistic leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> Fluxus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a collection of avant-garde artists whose works often consisted of creating public events, including melting a block of ice on a street corner. It was described by its founder, the late <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Maciunas </PERSON>, as `` a fusion of <PERSON> Spike </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, vaudeville, gags, children's games and <PERSON> Duchamp </PERSON>.'' Art historian <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> said the Fluxus Group was an important influence on the popularity of anti-establishment forms in art of all types. The Fluxists, in turn, were heavily influenced by the Dadaists and musician-composer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cage </PERSON>. At the time of his death, <PERSON> Watts </PERSON> also was developing silk-screened works and porkchop tables with art dealer <PERSON> Francesco </PERSON> <PERSON> Conz </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Verona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. In addition, <PERSON> Watts </PERSON> was working with `` flux-med,'' silk-screened images dealing with medical procedures, and had produced a portfolio of notes and sketches from his work in 1964-66. He was an art professor at <ORGANIZATION> Rutgers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> from 1953-84, and was the school's resident artist in film and mixed media from 1964-82. <PERSON> Watts </PERSON> also taught at the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Applied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> from 1951-52.

 A cruise ship that became stuck in arctic ice late last week during an educational journey for intellectuals canceled a call for help from an icebreaker on Saturday, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said. The Society Explorer, with 149 passengers and crew members, reported it was in no danger because of the ice and had moved close to Canadian waters, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Juneau </LOCATION>. The ship notified Canadian maritime officials on Wednesday it was trapped. `` It looks like they're free of the ice, they're moving and they have said they no longer need assistance,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. A 399-foot <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> icebreaker had been en route Saturday to assist the ship as well an oil-research support ship stranded in ice. The research vessel, which had called for assistance Friday, continued to await help Saturday. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> had said the 236-foot ocean liner was caught in <LOCATION> Beaufort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> ice 50 miles northeast of Point Barrow, or about 400 miles above the <LOCATION> Arctic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Circle </LOCATION>. The liner, bound for the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Passage </ORGANIZATION>, is operated by Society Expeditions Cruises of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, which specializes in journeys to unconventional destinations, including <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION>, and emphasizes libraries and lectures. Some of the passengers aboard the Society Explorer have been using the time to float in rafts routinely used for picture-taking trips and other activities. `` Our entertainment on board is mostly intellectual entertainment, not gambling and dancing,'' <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON>, planning director for the cruise operator, said late last week. He said the ship is `` absolutely safe'' and well-stocked with items on its continental menu. The cruise operator said it expects the Society Explorer to arrive on time at its destination off the southern coast of <LOCATION> Newfoundland </LOCATION> at the end of September.

<TEXT>
 About 500 people, including more than 300 from a nursing home, were evacuated Saturday after a tank truck carrying a hazardous chemical tipped over, releasing the chemical which formed a noxious cloud, officials said. No serious injuries were reported, but two men near the truck were taken to a hospital, complaining of burning eyes and chests after inhaling the chemical, phosphorus trichloride. The tanker tipped over about 6 p.m. Saturday when it sank into the rain-soaked ground of an unpaved parking lot near <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Highway 78. Further details about the incident were unavailable, officials said. The cloud hung over the city's north end, authorities said. The men were in good condition, said Trident Regional Medical Center nursing supervisor <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Pfennig </PERSON>. The evacuation included 15 to 20 workers of Presbyterian Home of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and its 320 residents, some of whom were removed in stretchers. Evacuees were taken to <ORGANIZATION> Summerville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coastal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, about six miles away. Authorities said they did n't know how much of the chemical had leaked out. Phosphorus trichloride is a clear, colorless, fuming liquid used chiefly in organic synthesis as a chlorinating agent. When it comes in contact with moisture, it forms a compound similar to an acid, according to Dr. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Metts </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Palmetto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. It can irritate the eyes and the mucous membranes of the respiratory system, <PERSON> Metts </PERSON> said.

 A newly formed tropical depression dissipated several hours after it sprang from an area of disturbed weather off the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> coast as a tropical storm churned in the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>, forecasters said Saturday. An <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> aircraft was unable to identify any center of circulation with the depression and all warnings along the Gulf coast were discontinued. Meantime, a depression in the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> some 800 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Bermuda </LOCATION> became Tropical Storm Ernesto, according to a 6 p.m. EDT advisory issued by the National Hurricane Center. The storm was moving north-northeast. Tropical storm warnings issued at 5 p.m. CDT Saturday from <LOCATION> Cameron </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Apalachicola </LOCATION> were discontinued by late evening, according to an advisory from the National Hurricane Center. The <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> storm was moving at 30 mph, and mainly posed a concern at sea, hurricane specialist <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Case </PERSON> said. Gradual strengthening was expected over the next 24 hours. `` It appears it is going to get some help with the colder air temperatures north of it ... and just become a big storm in the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>,'' he said. Depressions are upgraded to tropical storms when their maximum sustained winds reach 39 mph. Hurricanes pack winds of at least 74 mph. The first hurricane of the season, <PERSON> Debby </PERSON>, was downgraded Friday to a tropical storm after moving inland at <LOCATION> Tuxpan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, about 165 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>.

 Monsoon floods have marooned an estimated 20 million people across <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, officials said Sunday. Forty more people died in the deluge, bringing the death toll to 882, a newspaper reported. `` Shortage of medicine, cooked food and drinking water is causing untold miseries to millions of marooned people,'' said an official at the Relief Ministry in <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>. Rains battered <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> on Sunday, where an estimated 500,000 people have taken shelter from adjoining low-lying areas. Their presence and uncertainities over the floods caused prices of goods to rise in the city. Prices for rice, a staple, have risen 40 percent. The capital remained cut off for the third day Sunday as more areas of the runways at the international airport were submerged. Relief officials were unable to reach many interior areas where people were feared trapped with meager or no food and potable water, officials from four areas told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> by telephone. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity. They estimated that 20 million people were marooned in 50 of the country's 64 districts that were battered by the floods. The government issued new appeals for boats, helicopters and 3 million tons of food to combat the deluge. The Sangbad newspaper said 40 people died across the country on Saturday, taking the total death toll in the current monsson floods that began in June to at least 882. The government toll, considered understated, stood at 300. In <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>, several gas stations closed their pumps and hung `` No Gas'' signs. `` Unless to get fresh supplies the pumps will remain closed,'' said one station owner, <PERSON> Giasuddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON>. Annual floods are common in <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, one of the poorest countries in the world. At least 1,500 people died in floods last year. In 1985, more than 10,000 people were killed when cyclones and tidal waves hit low islands in the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bengal </LOCATION>, about 130 miles south of <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>.

 An ex-policeman convicted of participating in a pension fund scandal ended a 15-hour hostage ordeal by releasing the man who had exposed the scam, police said. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniele </PERSON>, 39, remained on the 15th floor of the office building where he had held <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, vice president of the city police board, said police spokeswoman <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Hancock </PERSON>. <PERSON> Daniele </PERSON>, who was armed with an unidentified weapon, had held no other hostages. He let <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> go about 1:30 a.m. Sunday. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> apparently was unharmed, police said. A hostage-response team and dozens of officers who had surrounded the building continued to negotiate with <PERSON> Daniele </PERSON> through the early morning hours, <PERSON> Hancock </PERSON> said. `` Right now they're still talking with him about the possibility of his coming out and ending the whole thing,'' she said. `` We're just talking,'' said Lt. Col. <PERSON> Calzona </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> at an earlier briefing as the ordeal passed the 12-hour mark. `` He's been very cooperative.'' The incident began at 10:30 a.m. <PERSON> Hancock </PERSON> said <PERSON> Daniele </PERSON> earlier had demanded to make a statement over <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> radio station KMOX-AM. Besides an eight-year term, <PERSON> Daniele </PERSON> was ordered to make restitution of $ 200,000. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, a lawyer and a member of the appointed civilian board that administers the <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, exposed the kickback scandal that cost police and fire pension funds an estimated $ 333,000. The scam was carried out by paying a brokerage artificially high commissions on stock transactions that were made with pension funds, prosecutors said. Participants in the scheme were then given back part of the money. <PERSON> Daniele </PERSON>, who headed the police pension fund, was the only one of six men indicted in the scam to stand trial. He was convicted of charges that included extortion, conspiracy and mail fraud, and could have received as much as 32 years in prison.

 A British container ship and a British destroyer accompanying it toward the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> collided, poking a hole in the warship and injuring 11 of its crewmen, officials said. British naval sources in <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION> said the accident occurred Saturday night when the <ORGANIZATION> HMS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southampton </ORGANIZATION> and the British-registered Tor Bay were 15 miles off the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> port of Fujairah on the Gulf of <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION>. The sources, speaking on condition of anonoymity, said the <ORGANIZATION> Southampton </ORGANIZATION> sailed on to Fujairah after a brief stop to assess its damage. During that stop, the 4,000-ton ship appeared `` badly holed'' and was `` seriously flooding,'' they said. But the sources said the situation was under control. The 34,477-ton Tor Bay, which was on its way from <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION>, in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>, escaped with only minor damage to its bow and continued its voyage after the accident. Its owners, P and O of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, said it would be repaired at <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> said 11 crewmen were injured _ three of them with broken bones, one suffering shock and the other seven with minor cuts and bruises. On arrival at <LOCATION> Fujairah </LOCATION>, the sailors with broken bones were moved to the local government hospital. One witness at the port said the <LOCATION> Southampton </LOCATION> was `` damaged extensively. ... -LRB- there's -RRB- a big gash on its port side, bigger than the size of a car.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Southampton </ORGANIZATION> has a 253-man crew. It came to the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> region to join the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> patrolling units last month. The sources said they could not tell how the collision occurred, especially that warships usually sail at least one mile away from the vessels they are escorting in the gulf. The <ORGANIZATION> Southampton </ORGANIZATION> is one of two <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> destroyers and a frigate that accompany merchant ships into and out of the gulf because of the 8-year-old Iraq-Iran conflict. There also are three British mine sweepers and three support vessels, including the <LOCATION> Olna </LOCATION> and Diligence, the sources added. A cease-fire began in the Iraq-Iran war Aug. 20.

 Young men on Sunday hurled gasoline and acid bombs at British soldiers as they tried to defuse a 300-pound bomb, but police drove off the assailants and the job was completed safely.

 Suspected Tamil rebels Sunday blew up a military vehicle in northern <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>, killing nine government soldiers and injuring three, military officials said. The attack near <LOCATION> Vavuniya </LOCATION> followed an ambush by the rebels in the north eastern <LOCATION> Trincomalee </LOCATION> on Saturday in which three Sri Lankan soldiers were killed. The military officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the rebels used remote-controlled explosives to blow up the military vehicle at <LOCATION> Cheddikulan </LOCATION>, 15 miles south west of <LOCATION> Vavunia </LOCATION>. Nine soldiers died immediately and three were critically injured. Sri Lankan Tamils, 18 percent of the nation's 16 million people, want an independent homeland in the north and east. The Tamils, who are Hindus, accuse the majority <PERSON> Sinhalese </PERSON>, who are Buddhists, of discrimination. At least 8,500 people have died in the 5-year-old Tamil separatist war.

<HEAD>Freighter Surrenders In Britain After Outrunning French

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A cargo ship suspected of carrying drugs surrendered to <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> customs officials after it was chased across the English Channel by <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> authorities who fired warning shots when it refused to stop. A <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> customs spokesman identified the vessel as the Honduras-registered <LOCATION> Salton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> and said it failed to stop for a routine check by <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> customs officials off <LOCATION> Boulogne </LOCATION> on the northeast French coast late Saturday. `` The French fired two shots across her bows and she then did a bunk -LRB- steamed away -RRB- into British waters,'' said the spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity. After a chase 40 miles across the English Channel, the freighter surrendered to the unarmed British coast guard cutter Swift and was escorted into <ORGANIZATION> Ramsgate </ORGANIZATION> on the southeast coast of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. Customs officers, specially trained dogs and divers were searching the vessel Sunday. British news reports said the ship was thought to be carrying illegal drugs, but the Customs and <ORGANIZATION> Excise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> would not comment. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Davies </PERSON>, an assistant collector for the Customs and <ORGANIZATION> Excise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, said no further information would be disclosed about the ship until it was fully searched, a job that was not expected to be completed Sunday. `` It is a pretty big ship and it is going to take a lot of rummaging,'' <PERSON> Davies </PERSON> said. `` It is a long hard job and we will be at it for some while.'' <ORGANIZATION> Kent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constabulary </ORGANIZATION> in <ORGANIZATION> Ramsgate </ORGANIZATION> said two men were taken off the ship and held in the town's police cells before being transferred Sunday to the police station in nearby <LOCATION> Dover </LOCATION>. About 30 British customs officers, some carrying bolt cutters and electronic equipment, boarded the ship, accompanied by two dogs trained to sniff for illegal drugs. Two divers disappeared under the ship, anchored 50 yards from the outer harbor wall. The British cutter and the French clipper Vent D'Avac, which fired the warning shots, were docked nearby. The spokesman said he did not know the freighter's destination, but he said it had come from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Salton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> is not listed in <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> Register of Ships. But Press Association, the domestic British news agency, said the vague outline of `` <LOCATION> Salton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Seahorse </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Virgo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La </LOCATION>.'' could be seen on the ship. A ship called the <LOCATION> Salton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Seahorse </LOCATION> is listed in <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> as being owned by <ORGANIZATION> Seahorse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Morgan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La </LOCATION>. That ship, built in 1973 by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, is a 170-foot-long supply ship.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> used song and poetry to mark the eighth anniversary of the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war on Sunday, a date chosen to underscore its claim that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> started the conflict. The week-long celebration of `` <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON>'s Qadissiyeh'' _ an <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> term for the war _ marks the anniversary of Iranian shelling of <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> territory that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> claims began the fighting on Sept. 4. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> dates the war's beginning 18 days later, when Iraqi troops invaded <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> cease-fire resolution accepted by both sides calls for an independent body to determine who began the war. The armed forces newspaper <PERSON> Al-Qadissiyeh </PERSON> said in an editorial that the anniversary `` has become an immortal event in our history so that coming generations will not forget the Persians' -LRB- Iranians' -RRB- aggression and evil intentions against Arabs and Islam. Banners strung in the streets by the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Baath </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and poems read over state television heaped praise on President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>. `` Through the great leader and the great people, victory and peace have been achieved,'' read one banner. `` Oh <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON>, thou art the voice of history,'' a poet pronounced on television. `` Thou art the only hero at a time when there is no one else to confront -LRB- the foe -RRB-. `` Thou hast brought back to <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Babylon </PERSON> their glory.'' Official newspapers hammered at the themes of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s stand at the U.N.-sponsored peace talks with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, and accused <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> of violating the cease-fire that took effect Aug. 20. They also blasted <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s insistence on returning to a southern border line established by the 1975 <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> agreement _ the middle of the Shatt <PERSON> Al-Arab </PERSON> waterway. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has renounced the pact, saying it wants all of the waterway. <PERSON> Saad </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Bazaz </PERSON>, director-general of the official <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, wrote in the <ORGANIZATION> Baath </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> Al-Thawra </ORGANIZATION> that before the war, `` <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> violated two important elements of the 1975 <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> agreement and chose only one to its benefit.'' He said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> refused to return land along the central border as the treaty demanded and failed to respect `` the principle of non-interference in internal affairs.'' Iranian support for Iraqi Kurdish rebels before the war had aggravated tensions between the neighboring states. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> dates the war to Sept. 4, 1980, when <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> shelled Iraqi towns on the central border after months of escalating propaganda claims by both sides. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> also accuses <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> of attacking ships in the Shatt <PERSON> Al-Arab </PERSON> before Sept. 22, when <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> invaded <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The term `` <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON>'s Qadissiyeh'' recalls a 7th century victory by Arab Islamic troops over the Persians in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> that opened the way for <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>'s expansion to the east.

<DATELINE>SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A southern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> chain of restaurants will pay $ 15,000 each to 23 people who sued, alleging were denied service because of race or ethnicity. Friday's settlement is the third involving the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Onion </ORGANIZATION> chain of Mexican food restaurants, based in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> suburb of <PERSON> Carson </PERSON>. It was accused of using dress codes and other excuses to bar minorities from their dining rooms. <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerr </PERSON>, who represented black, Hispanic and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> plaintiffs, said four more people were expected to accept the settlements this week. In depositions, <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Onion </ORGANIZATION> employees said board president <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> used the code name `` Norwegians'' for minorities and would say: `` The room is too dark. There's too many Norwegians in here,'' <PERSON> Kerr </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> denied the allegations, and <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Onion </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kurlander </PERSON> said that he was unaware of any corporate policy of discrimination but that he could not speak for each of the chain's 14 restaurants `` I'm not interested in the money, but I'm interested in the principle,'' said <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON>, 30, who claimed he was denied entry to the <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Onion </ORGANIZATION> in 1986. `` <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> is such a conservative, white type of county.

In November, six Iranians who sued in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> received a $ 240,000 settlement and an apology. In addition, at least 22 people who complained of discrimination in 1986 accepted $ 500 payments and agreed to forego legal action.

<HEAD>Leonid Brezhnev's Son-in-Law, Facing Possible Death Sentence, On
Trial</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The trial of <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>'s son-in-law, accused of taking $ 1.1 million in bribes, is expected to lay bare the widespread corruption of the <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> era. Court begins Monday for <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Churbanov </PERSON>, a former first deputy interior minister who once moved in the top levels of <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> society. If found guilty of bribe-taking and abuse of office, he and eight co-defendants could be executed by firing squad. Their trial, and the extraordinary publicity given its investigatory phase, are in line with <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s drive to break with the cronyism, corruption and nepotism now seen as endemic under <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> ruled the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> from 1964 until his death in 1982. The court case, to be heard by the Military Collegium of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, may also have a political aim _ to signal the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> Old Guard who flourished under <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> that their time has passed and that continued resistance to Gorbachev-era reforms must cease. <PERSON> Churbanov </PERSON>, who married <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>'s daughter <PERSON> Galina </PERSON> in 1971 after divorcing his first wife in 1964, is a central figure in an embezzlement and bribery scheme authorities say centered on the Central Asian republic of <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper Pravda said that beginning in the 1970s, cotton harvests in <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION> were padded by almost 1 million tons annually, and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> was made to pay for the non-existent crop by corrupt officials all the way up to longtime <LOCATION> Uzbek </LOCATION> party boss <PERSON> Sharaf </PERSON> <PERSON> Rashidov </PERSON>, who died in 1983. `` Today it has been proven that the cotton barons stole more than 4 billion rubles -LRB- $ 6.34 billion -RRB- from the state, half of which they stuffed into their own pockets,'' Pravda said this year in a sensational expose on the fraud, whose scale is without Soviet precedent. <PERSON> Churbanov </PERSON>, 51, who held the rank of colonel general in the Moscow-based ministry responsible for police and law enforcement nationwide, was a power-hungry epicure who helped shield the racket, Soviet press accounts say. `` The son-in-law became the ` first violin' at the end of the 70s,'' Pravda said last week. `` Having such a ` friend' was not only an advantage for <PERSON> Rashidov </PERSON> and his group _ it was vitally important.'' <PERSON> Churbanov </PERSON>, who worked as a mechanic before taking a low-level <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> job in 1961, is accused of accepting bribes totaling 651,888 rubles, the equivalent of $ 1.1 million. That sum, stupendous by Soviet standards, is equivalent to 270 years' pay for the average Soviet factory worker. The weekly <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> cited this encounter between <PERSON> Churbanov </PERSON>, then deputy interior minister, and <PERSON> Abduvakhid </PERSON> <PERSON> Karimov </PERSON>, then <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> boss in <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Bukhara </LOCATION> region: `` When an earthquake struck the town of <LOCATION> Gazli </LOCATION> ... <PERSON> Churbanov </PERSON> came to inspect relief efforts. ` There are n't any cigarettes in the stores,' he berated <PERSON> Karimov </PERSON> on the street. At his dacha that evening, <PERSON> Karimov </PERSON> gave <PERSON> Churbanov </PERSON> 10,000 rubles -LRB- $ 15,800 -RRB- in exchange for the latter's promise ` not to report shortcomings to his superiors.''' <PERSON> Karimov </PERSON> was sentenced to death for bribery by the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in June 1987 after an anti-corruption drive in <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION> that led to the replacement of two-thirds of all party-appointed officials. Officials announced <PERSON> Churbanov </PERSON>'s arrest in February 1987. He was fired from his top-level <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> job in 1984, but reportedly was employed as deputy chief of political administration for the ministry's uniformed security troops until September 1986. Along with <PERSON> Churbanov </PERSON>, currently in <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> custody, eight former <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION> officials will go on trial: Interior Minister <PERSON> Khaidar </PERSON> <PERSON> Yakhyaev </PERSON>, two of his deputies and five regional police chiefs. The evidence against the nine men fills 110 volumes, and five volumes were needed to spell out the indictment. A total of 501 witnesses are mentioned in the indictment. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> told reporters last week the trial is expected to last up to two months. <PERSON> Churbanov </PERSON> may be given the death penalty if convicted, <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said, because he is charged with serious economic crimes. <PERSON> Churbanov </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Makarov </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, said in an interview published last week that his client is being made a scapegoat for the ills of the <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> era. <PERSON> Makarov </PERSON> told the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> News: `` The impression is that <PERSON> Churbanov </PERSON> is being blamed for everything negative that we used to have, or that <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> is being tried under the name of <PERSON> Churbanov </PERSON>.'' Pravda, however, called <PERSON> Churbanov </PERSON> `` an example of the ` stagnation period,' when a person reached high position not because of his merits but due to his family connections.'' It added: `` Glasnost and democracy will help to avoid Churbanovism and anything similar to it.''

<HEAD>Death Toll from Starvation Hits 8,000 In Sudan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Fighting and seasonal flooding are blocking Western relief efforts in southern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>, where local reports indicate 8,000 people have starved to death in recent weeks, authorities say. Southerners arriving from <LOCATION> Wau </LOCATION>, 660 miles south of <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION>, said Saturday that thousands of people trekking north toward the <LOCATION> Kordofan </LOCATION> region have been marooned by floods for days. Many died, they said. `` Dozens of people have fallen dead on the roads leading to <PERSON> Meriam </PERSON> camp due to hunger,'' one new arrival told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Meriam </PERSON> is 500 miles south of <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION>. The Rev. <PERSON> Aengus </PERSON> <PERSON> Finucane </PERSON>, director of the Irish aid agency CONCERN, said last month that about 40 people were dying there daily. <PERSON> Bakheet </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>, another recent arrival, said he knew that thousands of people `` trying to flee the town of <LOCATION> Wau </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Babanusa </LOCATION> have perished before reaching there.'' <LOCATION> Babanusa </LOCATION> is 250 miles north of <LOCATION> Wau </LOCATION>. A government official said last week that at least 4,000 people died in <LOCATION> Aweil </LOCATION>, a way station between <LOCATION> Wau </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Babanusa </PERSON> that has been under siege by rebel forces for almost a year. Reports from the south reaching the Council of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, a government body, said the death toll in <LOCATION> Aweil </LOCATION> alone rose to 8,000 in recent days and that starvation and disease threatened thousands in other southern towns. Outside confirmation of the reports was virtually impossible. Even without the chaos caused by August's floods, travel in the south by journalists and most outsiders has been restricted for years because of the civil war. The rebel <ORGANIZATION> Sudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> took up arms against the government in 1983 and claims control over 90 percent of the southern countryside and towns. Fierce fighting between the government and rebels has forced southerners to leave crops and cattle for the safety of towns. Faced with dwindling food and medical supplies in these towns, southerners often try to make their way farther north, usually on foot. Another report reaching the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> said the situation in <LOCATION> Aweil </LOCATION> `` is dramatically deteriorating.'' It said floods washed away roads and bridges connecting the town with the outside, blocking whatever relief supplies might get through. The report said food supplies, especially southern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s staple sorghum, are low in <LOCATION> Wau </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Juba </LOCATION>, the south's main city 750 miles south of <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> The report said floods caused by heavy rains and fighting in the area was obstructing Western relief organizations' efforts to bring food and medicine to these areas.

 Fears of a terrorist attack prompted strict security measures Sunday as senior government officials from 95 countries began gathering for the <ORGANIZATION> Non-Aligned </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>'s foreign ministers conference. The five-day conference opens Monday with preparatory meetings. President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Vassilou </PERSON> formally begins the three-day foreign ministers' session Wednesday. <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> is expected to attend the conference in his current campaign to muster support for a plan to proclaim a provisional government for an independent Palestinian state. The conference will map out the 101-member <ORGANIZATION> Non-Aligned </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>'s role over the next decade and decide its next chairman. <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> is the current chairman. Conservative members are backing <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, while more radical states support <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, the only other official candidate. Some speculated that <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> could step in as a compromise candidate to break any deadlock that develops. A special anti-terrorist squad and about 1,500 police officers have been mobilized to guard the newly built conference center on <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>'s southern outskirts and the 14 hotels where the delegates will stay. Police in the Greek-controlled sector of the war-divided east <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> island have carried out mock terrorist attacks over the last few days to test security. Mobile patrols have been stepped up between <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION> airport, on the coast south of the capital, and the port city of <LOCATION> Limassol </LOCATION>. Police units have combed the ravines and hills bordering the highway. Armored vehicles have been deployed around the beachside airport. <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> government spokesman <PERSON> Akis </PERSON> <PERSON> Fantis </PERSON> said peace moves in the Iran-Iraq war, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Algeria-Morocco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION> dispute, the Soviet withdrawal from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and U.S.-Soviet relations were `` of tremendous importance'' to the movement. Fighting between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, both members of the movement, halted Aug. 20 when a U.N.-sponsored cease-fire took effect. With the recent rapprochement between <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> and Turkish Cypriots are trying to reconcile their differences as well. <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> has been divided since the Turkish Army invaded in July 1974 and seized the northern third of the island. <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cypriot </LOCATION> leader, and <PERSON> Rauf </PERSON> <PERSON> Denktash </PERSON>, leader of the Turkish Cypriot minority, broke a four-year deadlock when they met in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> under <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> auspices Aug. 24.

 A quadriplegic who earns thousands of dollars in donations on the Boardwalk by using her tongue to play a portable keyboard again faces charges of breaking the city's anti-begging laws <PERSON> Celestine </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> faces 12 charges of playing without a permit. She was issued summonses in 1986 for the same reason, but after a trial, a lawsuit and a lot of publicity, the city allowed Ms. <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> to play for money on the <LOCATION> Boardwalk </LOCATION>. The city, in backing down, assigned her a spot on the <LOCATION> Boardwalk </LOCATION> and required a permit. But prosecutors said she has not obtained the permit and has been playing in front of <ORGANIZATION> Bally </ORGANIZATION>'s Park Place casino hotel two blocks away for most of the summer. Ms. <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> argues that her <ORGANIZATION> Bally </ORGANIZATION>'s spot is shaded and that she was misled into thinking she would receive a merchant's license. City officials have instead offered her standard one-day Boardwalk permits, which require a $ 1 million insurance bond. She said such a bond would cost her $ 500 a day. City Prosecutor <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Smoger </PERSON> said the city `` made a great dispensation'' in allowing Ms. <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> to play for money on the <LOCATION> Boardwalk </LOCATION>. No other person, handicapped or otherwise, has been given that opportunity, he said. Birth defects left Ms. <PERSON> Tate </PERSON>'s arms and legs undeveloped. She supports herself and her children, ages 10 and 12, with the money she earns on the <LOCATION> Boardwalk </LOCATION>. She said she averages $ 2,000 a week, enough to send her children to private school. Police have also issued summonses to her brother and two paid attendants. The crackdown on Ms. <PERSON> Tate </PERSON>'s business was prompted by several citizen complaints, <PERSON> Smoger </PERSON> said, declining to elaborate. The prosecutor was unsympathetic to Ms. <PERSON> Tate </PERSON>'s insurance problems. `` If that's the price, so be it,'' he said. `` She earns more than enough to cover that. I think she should absorb the cost and pay it. `` She's a cunning, clever businesswoman,'' he said. `` I think she is overexaggerating to a great degree.'' Ms. <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> has requested a trial and time to obtain a lawyer. Meanwhile, she said, she will continue to entertain <PERSON> Boardwalk </PERSON> tourists with renditions of songs such as `` We Shall Overcome,'' `` Amazing Grace'' and `` Born Free.''

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> make campaign-launching Labor Day appearances Monday in a race for the presidency that has ignored the ceremonial starting point and is already a close and caustic contest. `` It kicked off earlier than any presidential campaign I've ever seen,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Greer </PERSON>, a consultant to Democratic candidates. `` The intensity this early is really astounding.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the Democratic nominee who has seen a huge midsummer's lead evaporate, campaigns through the industrial <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> hungering for the elusive intangibles of momentum and initiative that he once commanded <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the vice president and <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> nominee, enters the final nine weeks of his race for the White House appearing in control of their long-distance debate, at least for now, and enjoying a resurrection in the polls.

And, they include the debate over <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s controversial running mate, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, whose selection at a minimum forced a vacationing electorate to notice this presidential race. Both campaigns have revealed their themes, too. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is focusing on the economy, and middle class unease about the economic future, as well as questioning the judgment and fitness of the Republican ticket. `` Most Americans do n't feel they're sharing in <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s prosperity,'' said <PERSON> Dach </PERSON>, the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spokesman `` We're going to run on the economic issues. Those are the issues that are going to decide this election. What <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is trying to do is deflect the debate off the issues that people really care about.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has concentrated on raising doubts about <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and his record as governor, while suggesting gentle change from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration in such areas as protecting the environment. Now <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> plans to focus on jobs and the economy. Still to come are what may be the main events: televised debates, where an error can wreck a candidacy; and the wars of television advertising, which are certain to be hard fought. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s TV ads will begin airing soon, campaign manager <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> said. Media adviser <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Ailes </PERSON> is not tipping his hand on the content, but campaign sources said among them may be one featuring <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> victims terrorized by convicted murderer <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON>, who escaped while on a furlough from the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> prison system. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has made a major campaign issue of the furlough program that allowed passes for first-degree murderers, and which <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> reluctantly agreed to amend in the face of public outcry. Confident of his debating style honed as a public television show host, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is eager to confront <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign, however, has attempted to minimize the debates. It has agreed to two debates, plus a third between the running mates, and is insisting on scheduling them in late September and early October _ when the Olympics and World Series may keep some viewers away. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> responded strongly to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> during their summer jousting, even at one point evoking the imagery of rotting fish heads in describing President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and his vice president. But his campaign clearly is frustrated by the appearance that he is reacting and on the defensive, unable to direct the debate. There was implicit admission that all is not well in <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' announcement Friday of the return of his former campaign manager <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON>, who resigned in controversy a year earlier And <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on occasion has seemed tentative and reluctant in their long-distance debates, some believe. `` I'm not sure the Democrats have given back as good as we got,'' said <PERSON> Greer </PERSON>. `` I think we were lulled by that large lead.'' Where he once led by double-digit margins, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was shown in a dead heat with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> according to most recent polls, including an <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> poll last week. It had <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> up by 1 percentage point, 43-42, statistically insignificant. `` I do n't think anyone in the campaign, from top to bottom, anticipated the race tightening up to our advantage this quick,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> manager <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>. `` Our key is not to get confident, not to get cocky about it.'' Some Republicans believe <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> still trails a bit, however. `` I would say we're still realistically 5-6-7 points down,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> consultant <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahe </PERSON>, who is doing work for the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. He bases that on the difference, in some polls, of respondents who say they are deeply committed to a candidate. The battle is largely for those wavering or swing voters. They are often described as <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> Democrats, self-identified independents or Democrats who turned away from the party in 1980 and 1984. But what is striking is that the race is breathtakingly close all across the nation _ including the big battleground states like <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Even <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>'s home state of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> is even or nearly so in a recent poll. `` When <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was ahead, he was ahead everywhere. When <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> took the lead, it was everywhere. When it evens out now, it's kind of even everywhere,'' said <PERSON> Greer </PERSON>. `` It's amazing.''

 The new Miss <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, the first popularly elected winner of the annual beauty pageant, was hooted by some fellow contestants because she is 10 years older than many of them. <PERSON> Nadia </PERSON> <PERSON> Bengala </PERSON>, who says she is 26, was crowned Saturday night during the first live television broadcast of the contest by the state-run RAI network. `` I am very happy, especially after all the controvery over my age,'' she said, drawing cries of protest from some of the other 63 contestants. `` They are very beautiful,'' she added, `` but they can be even more beautiful in 10 years.'' The runner-up is 17 and third-place finisher 16. Another contestant was disqualified when it was revealed she was 14. After rushing off the stage in tears, she was awarded the title `` Miss Mascot.'' Last year's Miss <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> pageant was also marred by controversy. The winner was stripped of her title when she admitted that she was married and a mother. Miss <PERSON> Bengala </PERSON> is a beauty contest veteran who won the Lady <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> title in 1983. Because she had no official document to prove her age _ she said her passport was stolen at the <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION> train station _ Italian newspapers and news agencies suggested she could be older than 26. Miss <PERSON> Bengala </PERSON>, a part-time model who lives in <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION>, received 141,756 votes from television viewers who called a central number. The call-in votes were combined with those of the on-site jury. Miss <PERSON> Bengala </PERSON> was the first choice of the TV viewers, but only the third pick of the jurors.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid has helped prevent the takeover of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> by leftist guerrillas but has failed to solve the underlying social problems that sparked the insurgency, say four <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> lieutenant colonels who have served in the Central American nation and in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. `` The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> foundation for conducting small wars is defective,'' said the report, prepared while the four officers were on fellowships at the <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. The unsatisfactory results of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> effort in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, which the authors described as neither victory nor defeat, stem in part from local conditions and in part from the failure of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration to clearly define its goals, they said. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> provided resources not on the basis of some overall vision of success but in response to successive and increasingly acute crises,'' said the four <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officers, Lt. Cols. A.J. <PERSON> Bacevich </PERSON>, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hallums </PERSON>, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>. Administration officials failed to formulate a long-term strategy to help cure the social and economic ills of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, and did not coordinate the efforts of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military and civilian advisers, said the report. The report also concluded that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military, despite the lessons of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, helped mold the Salvadoran armed forces into a organization better suited for big European-style conflicts than Third World guerrilla wars. Their findings were contained in a 58-page booklet published by the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Analysis </ORGANIZATION>, affiliated with the <ORGANIZATION> Fletcher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> on Law and Diplomacy at <ORGANIZATION> Tufts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, in <LOCATION> Medford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. `` As long as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> remains a great power, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> involvement in small wars will recur with some frequency,'' they wrote. `` To find fault with American military policy in a particular instance is not to suggest that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is incapable of effective assistance to an ally threatened by an insurgency. The important thing is to get it right,'' they wrote, offering the following suggestions: _ `` Make room for the study of small wars in military schools.'' _ `` Clarify organizational responsibilities for fighting small wars, in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and in the field.'' _ `` Before undertaking any intervention, establish a vision of what you hope to accomplish and a consensus of political support to sustain that vision.'' _ `` Send your first team and permit its members the latitude to get the job done'' rather than training all capable officers to fight only large-scale wars. _ `` Avoid introducing inappropriate technology.'' The lieutenant colonels questioned other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officers with experience in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and found that none of them `` viewed the Salvadoran insurgency as primarily a military problem.'' `` None believed that killing guerrillas alone would win the war. All expressed the belief that only through political, social and economic reform could the Salvadoran government hope to defeat the insurgency,'' the report said. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> effort was also hampered by unreliable `` baloney-slice funding'' doled out by an unenthusiastic <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the report said. In addition, the <ORGANIZATION> Salvadoran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> have been molded along the lines of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military, which is better suited to major ground offensives than to small-unit guerrilla fighting. `` Almost instinctively, Americans take a rich man's approach to war,'' the report said. `` They view <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> access to technology, however expensive, as offering a significant comparative advantage over potential adversaries,'' it said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military advisers have imbued Salvadoran officers with the same outlook, the report said. `` Take the example of artillery. The Salvadoran Army fields 54 105 mm howitzers, employing them in one or two gun sections used primarily for harassing and interdiction.'' `` American experience in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> demonstrated that harassing and interdiction fires in an insurgency are at best wasteful and at worst counterproductive.'' Nonetheless, the report said, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> advisers endorsed the request of the Salvadoran military `` to replace its current howitzers with a new model that is identical in caliber but air-transportable.'' Similarly, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military backed a <LOCATION> Salvadoran </LOCATION> request for more sophisticated fighters and helicopters, although `` scarcely a week goes by without an aircraft being destroyed or damaged in an incident stemming from questionable maintenance or dubious flying skills'' by Salvadorans inadequately trained to handle super-sophisticated gadgetry. Moreover, guerrilla forces in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> are no longer capable of fighting major engagements, in which sophisticated fighters and helicopters can help, and `` now operate in smaller units and emphasize hit-and-run attacks'' in which such air support is of limited use, the authors wrote.

<TEXT>
 The release of silty water from the bottom of a reservoir to irrigate alfalfa has killed hundreds of fish in one of the last self-sustaining trout streams in the West, authorities said. The release turned a nine-mile stretch of the once-pristine <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Walker </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in the eastern <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> into a silt-choked brown wash. Some of the trout asphyxiated when silt clogged their gills were almost 2 feet long and weighed more than 9 pounds. The river was declared dead by <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Trout, a 3,400-member sportsmen's conservation group that opposed the water release. `` The reservoir release has successfully killed all the trout'' in the river, said spokesman <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockel </PERSON>, who called the loss `` catastrophic.'' The water _ the lower 12 feet of the <LOCATION> Bridgeport </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reservoir </LOCATION> _ was released on Wednesday and Thursday for farmers and ranchers downstream near <LOCATION> Yerington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev </LOCATION>. Farmers and ranchers said they needed the water and had a legal right to it. They said they're struggling after two straight dry winters and that the water might save this year's crop of alfalfa, used as livestock feed. The East Walker, 110 miles south of <PERSON> Reno </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, was one of the eastern <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION>'s last trophy trout streams. It did not need to be stocked, having one of the few self-sustaining wild trout populations in the West. `` All these dead fish, it sends a chill up my spine,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Markwith </PERSON>, a fly fisherman from <LOCATION> Redwood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. `` We'll find some place else to fish this weekend, but it wo n't be as good.'' In August, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Trout unsuccessfully tried to obtain a restraining order against the draining of the reservoir. `` We have no problems sharing this water with our neighbors in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> _ they have a problem, too,'' <PERSON> Rockel </PERSON> said. `` But we have a problem of losing our fishery and it looks like we did, all because of improper management.''

<TEXT>
 For the first time, <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s casinos are being allowed to use the <ORGANIZATION> Miss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pageant </ORGANIZATION> almost as a publicity prop But the contestants still can not set foot on the gaming floors during pageant week. The contest rulebook describes the contestants as `` young ladies who exemplify the integrity of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> youth,'' and it was on that basis that the pageant never let the gaming halls get involved in any of the publicity. The casinos were mostly outsiders to the pageant festivities, not allowed to do much more than provide rooms for the women and decorate floats for the parade. But things have changed. Casino logos now will figure prominently in many photographs taken during this year's pageant week. Entertainer <PERSON> Merv </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>, who is in the middle of a deal to buy Resorts International, was host at a reception Friday night for the contestants and posed with all 51 under a giant Resorts logo topped with a crown. On Saturday, casino owner <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> invited contestants to be photographed aboard his opulent yacht, the Trump Princess. In the morning, contestants posed for a pool shot underneath a large Trump Plaza sign. The Sands and <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Claridge </PERSON> casino hotels also jumped on the bandwagon, bringing in <LOCATION> Miss </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> 1988, <PERSON> Kaye </PERSON> <PERSON> Lani </PERSON> <PERSON> Rae </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafko </PERSON>, to cut the ribbon to a small museum exhibit at the entrance to the two gaming halls' people mover, a moving sidewalk that carries customers in from the boardwalk. The move to include casinos in the pre-pageant publicity came with the appointment of <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> as the pageant's new executive director. He succeeded veteran <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Marks </PERSON>, who retired earlier this year. `` Casinos are the only major industry in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and have been very good to the Miss <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> program,'' <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> said. `` But I found out that many of the casinos felt that while they've been good to us, we've never given them the opportunity to utilize the Miss America Pageant.'' They're utilizing the pageant now, and the atmosphere's changing. Friday night's reception, for instance, was a rare opportunity for the 51 women to be seen in an atmosphere of drinking, smoking and even some suggestive jokes. `` Send them in _ this is a buffet tonight,'' <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> said, rubbing his hands together in mock anticipation as the contestants entered. Of course, the contestants and their hostesses were not served any alcoholic beverages with their meals, although waiters poured wine for anyone next to them. And they ca n't gamble during during pageant week, not even if they're 21, old enough legally.

<TEXT>
 Former White House National Security Adviser <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> finds `` very legitimate'' parallels between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> involvement in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration policy in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, according to a new book in which he is quoted. The book, `` On Bended Knee: The Press and the Reagan Presidency,'' also quotes <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON>, former deputy White House chief of staff, as saying that <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> `` wanted to clean house'' in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and made `` outrageous'' statements about the subject when he was secretary of state. The book was written by <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Hertsgaard </PERSON>, an investigative journalist who has written two books about the nuclear power industry. It is being published this month by <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Straus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Giroux </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hertsgaard </PERSON> argues in the book that the news media have shown a `` more deferential attitude'' toward President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> than toward other recent presidents. This made it easy, he says, for <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> `` to promote his analysis of the situation in Central America through the press'' _ an analysis that held that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> were fomenting revolution in the region. As controversy developed over the administration's Central American policies, however, <PERSON> Hertsgaard </PERSON> writes, `` a new theme emerged in news coverage: Was the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> getting involved in another <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>?'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> repeatedly denied that he intended to send <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops to the region and `` seemed almost to resent the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> parallels,'' <PERSON> Hertsgaard </PERSON> said. The author reports, however, that <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>, in an interview for the book, said the issues of Cuban-Soviet involvement and of a possible repeat of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> `` contribute to a very reasonable framework for press treatment of the issue.'' `` Evoking a recollection of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> is a very legitimate point to make, because it simply exposes the reality of difficulty you will have in sustaining popular support for your policy,'' <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> is quoted as saying. `` That's a valid criticism. You may not like it, but it's real.'' <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> has pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges of withholding information from congressional committees investigating covert aid to Nicaraguan rebels at a time when military assistance to them was prohibited. <PERSON> Hertsgaard </PERSON> reports that both <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> and his boss, then <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Chief of Staff <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, were `` leery of the <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> initiative from the start.'' `` <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and I tried constantly to keep under control the whole <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> thing,'' <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> is quoted as saying. `` <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> wanted to go in there and clean house.

However, he says, after a White House decision to `` low-key'' the issue, the number dropped to 60 in the following three months although the civil war in the Central American country continued unabated.

 Two East Germans escaped to the West by swimming across a canal Sunday, but border guards thwarted another escape attempt when they fired at a man trying to flee his communist homeland, police said. The would-be escapist, who did not appear to be injured, was arrested and led away by border troops, a police spokesman in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> said. In all, two East German border guards and four other people have fled to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> the last three days. Police said two men in their early 30s swam across a canal to reach <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> early Sunday. On Saturday, the two guards jumped across the heavily fortified border into the British-controlled sector of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, police said. Both guards were being questioned by British authorities, police said. On Friday, two men made a daring pre-dawn escape to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> by swimming across the <LOCATION> Havel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. The men were spotted by an East German patrol boat that gave pursuit to the border but no shots were fired. None of the escapees was identified in accordance with West German regulations.

<HEAD>Government Approves Movement Advocating Multiparty Elections</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The communist government has approved a new group that advocates multiparty elections, but members say they have no intention of starting their own political party. The Hungarian Democratic Forum established itself as a `` democratic, intellectual and political movement'' by adopting a charter on Saturday, the state news agency <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> reported. Hungarian state radio said the forum wants to field candidates for national, regional and local elections. But forum members said they do n't plan to form a political party and only want to promote `` an open coalition-type movement, open to any honest thoughts and initiatives.'' The forum's 364 delegates met in a tent at <LOCATION> Lakitelek </LOCATION>, 75 miles south of <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>, the same village where a group of nonconformist intellectuals met in September 1987 to form a loose organization under the same name. Commenting on the forum meeting, government spokesman <PERSON> Gyoergy </PERSON> <PERSON> Marosan </PERSON> told Hungarian radio, `` On the basis of government policy, this is a welcome development.'' <PERSON> Marosan </PERSON>, the son of a former leading Social Democrat in pre-communist <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, said the government would cooperate with the movement as long as the forum cooperates. He said if people wonder about the `` foundation of a new party,'' they underestimate recent changes in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. Prime Minister <PERSON> Karoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>, who took over from <PERSON> Janos </PERSON> <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> in May, has pushed for political and economic reforms. <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> had led <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> since Soviet troops put down the Hungarian uprising in 1956. The fact that the meeting was reported in the state media was another indication that the forum has received official blessing. <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> said the forum considers a multiparty system `` indispensable in the process of democracy.'' The news agency quoted forum leaders as saying the movement wants to operate `` within the framework of constitutionality and legality, before the general public in all openness.'' One of the speakers at the meeting, <PERSON> Csaba </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kis </PERSON>, called for a coalition of socialists, <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> and liberals, said Austrian journalist <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Pfeifer </PERSON>, who attended the meeting. `` We do not strive to hold power, but we want to control power,'' <PERSON> Kis </PERSON> was quoted as saying. <PERSON> Sandor </PERSON> <PERSON> Csoori </PERSON>, a leading member of the forum, said he received official permission to publish a journal called Credit every other week beginning in November. Delegates told a news conference that dissidents who have been able to write only for underground publications would be given a chance to contribute legally to the forum's journal.

<TEXT>
 The most negative political advertising campaign ever is likely this fall from two presidential candidates who are close in the polls, close on the issues and far from shy about going on the offensive. Students of political advertising say media drives by the <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaigns are likely to begin on an upbeat note. But viewers should n't expect sunshine and roses on the air. Critical ads ranging from mild comparisons to outright blasts are planned by independent groups and the two parties, and the candidates are expected to follow suit later in the season. Ultimately, the race will be `` the most negative in the history of TV,'' predicted <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Jamieson </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> professor and author of two books on political communications. Democrat <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and Republican <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> both scheduled traditional Labor Day week media assaults, with at least one of them employing a soft sell as the campaign season formally begins. `` Our plan is to be on the air with ads about <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' record,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dach </PERSON> `` The major thrust of the first wave will be cutting taxes, balancing budgets, putting people to work, cutting crime and taking charge of our economic future. Those are ads that <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ca n't make.'' <PERSON> Dach </PERSON> would not say how much money will be spent on the first wave but he said it will `` hit a lot of states ... We intend these ads to be seen by people, not just to be read about.'' The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign is more closemouthed about its plans, although it has been reported that a three-week, $ 1 million TV campaign will start this week in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. `` We're firm about not discussing any media buying strategy or any creative strategy,'' said <PERSON> Sig </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogich </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s director of advertising operations. `` The Democrats will tell you -LRB- their plans -RRB-, and we appreciate it,'' he added. <PERSON> Rogich </PERSON> refused to comment on a report from campaign sources that media adviser <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Ailes </PERSON> has taped ads attacking <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' defense ideas and interviewing a <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> couple victimized by convicted murderer <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> prisoner furloughed under the state's program. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' predecessor, Republican Gov. <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sargent </PERSON>, instituted the furlough program which <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has supported. Earlier this year, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor reluctantly signed legislation removing eligibility for first-degree murderers. At least one independent group plans a month-long, $ 540,000 assault on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> via national cable networks starting Tuesday, according to <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. The two 30-second ads produced for Americans for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> charge that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is soft on crime and criminals. One cites the weekend prisoner furlough program and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' opposition to the death penalty; the other focuses on <PERSON> Horton </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dach </PERSON> says <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> plans to counter such attacks with ads touting his effective crime-cutting record in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. But he said plans could change, depending on what comes out of the Republican camp. Some relatively negative ads are coming from the Democratic and Republican national committees, which are running multimillion dollar generic media campaigns designed to promote party themes and accomplishments as superior to the opposition. The <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> just completed a $ 4 million TV ad campaign that involved three spots running for two weeks in every state. The ads claim Americans have known only peace and prosperity under Republicans, so why change? <ORGANIZATION> RNC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Brainard </PERSON> said plans for the timing and content of next wave were up in the air but `` things are in place'' for another hit if it is needed. `` We're going to wait and see the tenor of the campaign,'' she said. `` There may be a need to issue specific ads of some kind that incorporate our message of peace, prosperity, economic growth and seven years of success.'' The <ORGANIZATION> DNC </ORGANIZATION>, financially equipped to run its first major generic campaign this year, bought $ 75,000 worth of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> airtime for a quick counterpunch to the initial <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> ads and this week embarks on a $ 1 million-plus generic ad campaign in seven to 12 swing states likely to include <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> DNC </ORGANIZATION> ads, centered on the theme of `` bringing prosperity home,'' are two-pronged. Some deal with competitiveness, world debt and the deficit _ making <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> No. 1 again. Others talk about economics on a more personal scale _ health care, child care, the ability to buy homes and cars. The point, said <PERSON> Dach </PERSON>, is that `` if you're a family that's working harder to stay in place, you ca n't afford to vote Republican. By the time the Bush-Dukakis campaign ends, <PERSON> Jamieson </PERSON> said, negative TV advertising should surpass the high-water mark set during the bitter 1964 Johnson-Goldwater battle, the most negative to date. Observers cite a number of factors in explaining why they expect a nasty TV campaign: _ Attack ads were a major feature of both party's primary contests this year, providing both precedent and raw material _ <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and to some extent <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> are already giving very tough speeches, and advertising traditionally is more negative than speeches _ The candidates are neck-and-neck in the polls, giving them both an incentive to go negative _ Neither candidate is particularly well-defined, making it imperative that every attack be answered by a counter-attack lest voters get and keep the wrong idea _ Both candidates are relatively centrist, with few significant differences on issues `` If you do n't have broad issue disagreements, then you concentrate on the personal,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabato </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> professor specializing in election media, polling and direct mail. <PERSON> Jamieson </PERSON> said the 1964 campaign was the most negative in the number of negative ads produced and aired, but neither candidate devoted more than one-third of his air time to negative ads. She and <PERSON> Sabato </PERSON> predicted negative messages will fill one-third to one-half of each candidate's air time this year, and neither will let negative ads eclipse positive ones. Why? `` It's just too risky in terms of backlash,'' <PERSON> Sabato </PERSON> said. `` Attacking is not presidential,'' added <PERSON> Jamieson </PERSON>. `` You can get by with negative ads as long as the positive message is out there.''

 While politicians normally do n't want to be linked with women other than their wives, there's one gal that candidates have been fawning over for more than 100 years. She's 151 feet tall and stands demurely in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>. Candidates and their image makers say there's no better company to be seen in _ especially on coast-to-coast television _ than that of the Statue of Liberty. So coveted is she as political company that the campaigns of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the Democratic presidential nominee, and <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential contender Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> clashed over which of them would hold the lady's hand this Labor Day. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> prevailed, but only because he asked first, according to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. As the statue's custodian, the <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> takes great pains to assure the statue does not show favorites. Still, she has been always been a willing companion since her dedication by President <PERSON> Grover </PERSON> <PERSON> Cleveland </PERSON> in 1886. <PERSON> Woodrow </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> have all paid calls on the statue during re-election bids. `` The Statue of Liberty is something special,'' says <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Ailes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION>, media consultant for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. For tugging at voters' emotions, the grandiose statue and her dramatic surroundings are a better backdrop than any Hollywood set. The statue took its prime place in the World War I war bond drives of 1917, replacing the female <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> as the personification of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, says <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> archivist <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Marino </PERSON>. No less an image maker than <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitchcock </PERSON> dropped a villian from the statue's torch in `` Saboteur'' about 27 years before putting <PERSON> Cary </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> and <PERSON> Grace </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> on <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rushmore </LOCATION> in `` North by Northwest.'' `` There's more emotion packed in the Statue of Liberty than almost anything else in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> says. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> chose Liberty State Park in <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, to kickoff the 1980 campaign that put him in the White House. The Hudson River-front park offers a dramatic view of the statue against the skyscrapers of lower <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, running against <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Republican <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> in 1916, led an elaborate parade to relight the statue's torch after it was damaged by sabatoge. <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>, campaigning against <PERSON> Alf </PERSON> <PERSON> Landon </PERSON> in 1936, gave a dramatic radio address by the statue during its 50th anniversary celebration. This year, along with <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, former presidential candidate <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has used the park as a political staging ground. Both <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> wanted to appear Monday at the two-island Statue of Liberty-complex: <LOCATION> Liberty </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, where the statue stands, and <LOCATION> Ellis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, where millions of immigrants entered the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the late 1800's and early 1900's. Since <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> asked first, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had to settle for a tour of <LOCATION> Ellis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> on Saturday. He escorted his mother, <PERSON> Euterpe </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> immigrant who arrived in this country via the island. `` It's first come, first served,'' explained <PERSON> Edie </PERSON> <PERSON> Shean-Hammond </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Parks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman. She said rangers follow strict guidelines in issuing permits for speeches and demonstrations. Access for daily visitors always comes first, followed by equal access for anyone seeking to use the statue as a soapbox. `` We have to play this really close to the book,'' Ms. <PERSON> Shean-Hammond </PERSON> said.

 There's a new multimillionaire somewhere out there, as only one Lotto ticket held the six numbers needed to win <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s richest-ever lottery jackpot of at least $ 54 million, officials said Sunday. The winning $ 1 ticket for Saturday night's drawing was purchased in <LOCATION> Longwood </LOCATION>, a town of 14,500 in central <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, Lottery Secretary <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> said. She declined to name the store until the winner steps forward. Eight-digit riches were also doled out in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, where one winning ticket was purchased for a $ 23 million jackpot Saturday night, and in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, where holders of four winning tickets will split a $ 21 million prize. The previous national record jackpot, $ 51.4 million, was shared by two <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> lottery players in June. A <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> couple had the largest single-ticket lottery prize until now when they won $ 46 million in 1987. The new <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> millionaire _ or millionaires, if several persons shared the ticket _ get 180 days to claim the prize. The earliest it can be claimed is Tuesday, after the Labor Day holiday. The prize will be doled out over 20 years. The state lottery withholds 20 percent of large payouts for federal income taxes, although actual federal taxes owed could be higher. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> has no state income tax. Splitting a $ 54 million payout into 20 installments, and deducting 20 percent, would bring the annual check to $ 2.16 million. Officials had estimated Saturday's jackpot at $ 52 million, but a last-minute frenzy of sales that sometimes topped 850 tickets a second raised the total to $ 54 million. It could be even larger, depending on final sales figures. Saturday sales totaled 14.6 million tickets, and total weekly purchases were 44.78 million by the 11 p.m. drawing. Players had turned to psychics, gimmicks and other formulas to beat the 14 million-to-1 odds of picking the six winning digits out of 49. The winning numbers were 3-5-19-20-27-35. Until Saturday, there had n't been a winner in the drawing since Aug. 6. That boosted the jackpot with each passing week. `` This became an international news story. What better way to let people know about your lottery than through an international news story?'' Mrs. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> said at a news conference. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> began its lottery only this year. At least $ 20 million of the week's lottery profits will go to state education, she said. <LOCATION> Longwood </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gunter </PERSON> said he was delighted to have the $ 54 million ticket sold in his town. The bedroom community 18 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> has several lottery outlets. `` I think we're due to be on the map,'' said <PERSON> Gunter </PERSON>. `` This is one great way to put us on it. It's always good to have a small city wake up and learn that one individual has had such fantastic luck.'' Besides the jackpot, more than 1 million other Lotto players won smaller prizes. Ticket vendors across the state reported brisk Saturday sales. `` Frantic is n't the word,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Salvatore </PERSON>, owner of Lotto News in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. `` It's madness.'' Meanwhile, lotteries in other states credited <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s Lotto with boosting their sales. `` That kind of publicity raises the awareness of lottery of everyone in the nation, and we all see an increase in sales,'' said <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rem </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> lottery. As in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, the winners of the $ 21 million <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> drawing and the $ 23 million <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> lottery were not immediately identified. The winning ticket in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> was sold in prosperous <LOCATION> Westchester </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, north of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, while the four winning tickets in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> were sold in the suburbs of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lottery </LOCATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> George </PERSON> spoke via telephone on an <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> radio talk show and said he was deluged with questions from people who wanted to play <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s game. `` I told them to climb into a good solid car or buy a plane ticket and come on out and visit,'' <PERSON> George </PERSON> said.

 A chlorine gas leak from a swimming pool supply company forced up to 1,000 people from their homes for the second day in a row early Sunday, authorities said. No injuries were reported. Most of the evacuations were in <LOCATION> Montebello </LOCATION>, eight miles east of downtown <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, and residents were allowed back about 8 a.m., 2 -LCB- hours later. The leak occurred during cleanup at <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> warehouse where a mishap on Saturday spewed a low-lying, half-mile-long chlorine cloud, sent 37 people to hospitals and forced the evacuation of up to 15,000. `` I understand that the cloud was not as visible, and seemed to be much smaller,'' said <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Fire Capt. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Sweeney </PERSON>. `` There was a definite smell of chlorine.'' Chlorine can be lethal in high concentrations but otherwise causes mostly burning eyes and sore throats. The leak Saturday occurred when a powdered chemical used to make chlorine tablets for pools contacted moisture or another contaminant, producing a reaction, authorities said. `` There's a company cleaning up from the incident yesterday and they just happened to dump a little more on the ground,'' <PERSON> Sweeney </PERSON> said. `` It was n't any big deal. It was less than 100 pounds.'' As before, soda ash was used to neutralize the material, but more small spills were possible as the cleanup continued, <PERSON> Sweeney </PERSON> said. `` A guy turns a shovel the wrong way and it might react again,'' he said. The evacuation was ordered by county health officials monitoring the cleanup. Fewer than 1,000 residents were involved, said Deputy Chief <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Simonian </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Montebello </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The earlier evacuation covered several square miles of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Monterey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, Montebello and Commerce, authorities said. A similar reaction occurred in several drums of the same material on Aug. 17, but no gas cloud was released and no injuries were reported, said <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilde </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Grow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>'s Consumer and <ORGANIZATION> Professional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. `` The prime suspect is moisture ... some moisture from condensation from the high humidity we've been having,'' <PERSON> Wilde </PERSON> said. The Saturday evacuation was criticized by a local community group. `` The lack of organization was frightening,'' said <PERSON> Angie </PERSON> <PERSON> Rojas </PERSON>. `` This morning there were many people walking the street with their children looking for a safe site.'' The group said authorities failed to provide mass transportation or evacuation warnings in Spanish. The area is primarily Hispanic.

 <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> Jewish settlers demonstrated Sunday to demand government permission to shoot at Palestinian stone-throwers. Soldiers in the occupied lands shot and wounded three Palestinian protesters. At a Cabinet meeting, Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> denied news reports that he recommended expanding defense rules to allow soldiers and civilians to fire back at stone-throwers in the occupied lands, ministers said. Jewish settlers have been demanding both the army and settlers be allowed to open fire on Palestinians throwing stones. Only soldiers now are allowed to shoot at Arab firebombers. Settlers are permitted to fire back only in the case of imminent danger to life. The controversy over those rules flared last week when a U.S.-born Jewish settler accidentally shot and wounded two <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers. The settler, <PERSON> Gedalia </PERSON> <PERSON> Becker </PERSON>, stopped his car and fired in the dark after a firebomb attack. About 200 residents of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> settlement of <PERSON> Einav </PERSON> occupied a park opposite <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s office Sunday and said they ca n't live in their settlement because government policies do n't allow adequate protection against stone-throwers Small children and their mothers sat under tents marked `` Day Care Center'' and `` Kindergarten,'' surrounded by six police vans and about two dozen policemen. <PERSON> Einav </PERSON> secretary <PERSON> Baruch </PERSON> <PERSON> Lior </PERSON> said two people from his settlement of 40 families have been hit in the head in stone-throwing attacks the last 10 days. `` We demand an elementary right to protect our lives. The army is doing everything it can, but the government ties its hands. Can the government say it did not spill this blood?'' <PERSON> Lior </PERSON> said. An elderly injured settler, <PERSON> Shlomo </PERSON> <PERSON> Levi </PERSON>, lay nearby on a stretcher, a blood-stained bandage on his head. <PERSON> Levi </PERSON> was surrounded by praying Jews, one of whom held a prayer book and an Uzi submachine gun on his knees. At <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s office, the Cabinet debated rules of opening fire. Energy Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Shahal </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> he accused <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> of trying to turn the occupied lands into a `` wild West where each one takes the law in his hands.'' <PERSON> Shahal </PERSON>'s attack followed media reports that <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, head of the rival <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc, supports the idea of shooting stone-throwers. But <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> denied supporting such a proposal, said his spokesman, <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON>. `` <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is facing a wave of terror and has to meet it with a firm hand. Security forces are working on methods to counter the stone-throwing. ... It's good that the Cabinet debates it, and we hope the army will soon find an answer,'' <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> as telling the ministers. In the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, troops shot an 18-year-old Palestinian, <PERSON> Suheil </PERSON> <PERSON> Harb </PERSON>, wounding him in the stomach, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports and hospital officials said. They said he was wounded during a clash with soldiers at <LOCATION> Kafr </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sur </LOCATION> <LOCATION> village </LOCATION>, close to <PERSON> Einav </PERSON>. In the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, another Arab, 22-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Mahmoud </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abdel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> el </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Balah </ORGANIZATION> village, was shot in the leg, officials at the <LOCATION> Ahli </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> hospital in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> said. An official at <ORGANIZATION> Al </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ittihad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that 26-year-old <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Yussef </PERSON> <PERSON> Sohahmi </PERSON> was shot and seriously wounded in the neck during a clash with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Silat </LOCATION> <LOCATION> el </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harithiya </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Jenin </LOCATION>. The army said it knew of no clash between soldiers and Palestinians in <LOCATION> Deir </LOCATION> <LOCATION> el </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Balah </LOCATION>, confirmed that a Palestinian was shot and lightly wounded in the leg in <PERSON> Kafr </PERSON> <PERSON> Sur </PERSON> and was investigating the reported shooting in <ORGANIZATION> Silat </ORGANIZATION> el <LOCATION> Harithiya </LOCATION>. Since the Palestinian uprising began Dec. 8 against Israeli rule in the occupied lands, 5,600 Arabs have been wounded, according to Israeli army figures. At least 258 Palestinians and four Israelis have died.

 <PERSON> Gorky </PERSON> residents received dramatic proof of the greater openness in their nation's public affairs when local <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> officials allowed a party meeting to be televised live for the first time. During the broadcast, residents of the <LOCATION> Volga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> city 250 miles east of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> could call in and make proposals to the party officials, the government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said Sunday. `` We hope the discussion of burning problems in the presence of the people and with the help of television will become a standard of party work,'' <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapanov </PERSON>, a senior <PERSON> Gorky </PERSON> party executive, was quoted as saying. The newspaper said the broadcast of the Gorky regional party organization's meeting on Saturday was a first for the region, but it was believed to be the first time any body in the 20 million-member party had allowed a full, live broadcast of its proceedings. The broadcast also was reported by the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency. Despite Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s promotion of `` glasnost,'' or more openness in public affairs, deliberations of party organizations up to the ruling Politburo continue to be held in secret. Often their meetings are only sketchily reported to the public. At a nationwide party conference held in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> this summer, some delegates demanded more information be made public about the work and responsibilities of party organizations and officials. Speaking in a telephone interview with <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Chapanov </PERSON> said Saturday's plenary party meeting in Gorky `` was preceded by a month of strenuous work for preparing the live broadcasting, which is unusual so far in party practices.'' A newspaper in <LOCATION> Gorkey </LOCATION> announced in advance the plan to televise the regional party plenum, <PERSON> Chapanov </PERSON> said. Phone numbers that gave people access to the meeting hall were also made public, he said. According to <PERSON> Chapanov </PERSON>, `` people appreciated the initiative. Some 50 telephone calls and proposals were registered during the work of the session.'' <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> did not make clear whether the Gorky regional committee intended to continue allowing live coverage of its sessions, or whether the practice could spread elsewhere. In the past, top <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> officials, including Ideology Secretary <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yakovlev </PERSON>, have defended the party's practice of holding meetings behind closed doors, saying the need for greater openness in government does not oblige the party, legally a private body, to open its proceedings to all.

 Opposition leader <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON> said Sunday that <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s rulers must `` face the reality'' and allow an interim government to usher in immediate democracy and end nationwide chaos. Meanwhile, <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Congressman <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, said he would introduce a measure next week in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> expressing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for a rapid transition to multi-party democracy in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>. Speaking at a <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> news conference after a two-day trip to <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s political future would probably be decided in the next week. `` I think there is no question that <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> is on the dawn of a new era of democracy,'' <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON> said. `` The only question is whether the new era will emerge peacefully ... or whether it will be the product of chaos, anarchy and violence.'' At their meeting in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> earlier Sunday, <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON> told <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON> the entire country rejected the government's plan for gradual change. <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON> met separately with two other protest leaders: former Defense Minister Tin Oo and <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON> <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON>, daughter of late <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> independence leader <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON>. <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON> also lunched at the Parliament Building with President <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>. No major rallies were held in the capital Sunday, but protest leaders called for daily demonstrations this week leading up to a nationwide general strike Thursday. <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON> chairs the <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Subcommittee </ORGANIZATION> of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. He has been a critic of repressive governments in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and said he was visiting <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> to see what the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> could do to encourage democracy. <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON> his reaction to <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>'s plan for the <ORGANIZATION> Burma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to meet on Sept. 12 to consider a popular vote on whether to end 26 years of one-party rule. `` The whole country is against it,'' said <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON>, who was recently released from a month of detention for criticizing the party's harsh repression of dissent and ruinous economic policies. `` Government employees are on strike, the administration has practically broken down, the situation has deteriorated very fast and is now beyond control,'' <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON> said. `` The whole country demanded immediate formation of an interim government to ease the situation. The government has to face the reality.'' <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON> said he believes Ne Win, who took power in a 1962 military coup in but officially resigned in July, still wields `` 100 percent'' power. <PERSON> Hardliner </PERSON> <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> replaced Ne Win, but his 17-day rule was ended by massive and bloody street protests that left 112 dead by government count. <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> took over Aug. 19 as the first civilian leader since 1962. <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON> said the people had tolerated their government for many years, but recent months brought `` a series of intolerable things.'' He said these included the government's voiding of a large portion of currency notes without compensation in September and rice shortages in a nation that once was the world's largest exporter.

<HEAD>Lightning Danger Greater Than Thunder Indicates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Bolts of lightning strike far more often than weather records indicate, making electrical storms more dangerous than previously believed, a weather researcher warns. The reason is that most records on lightning occurrences are compiled by observers who listen for thunder, which is produced by lightning. But new research shows that between 22 percent and 40 percent of lightning flashes occur when no thunder was heard. `` It is not good news,'' researcher <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Changnon </PERSON> said of his findings, reported in the August edition of the Journal of Geophysical Research-Atmospheres. `` Those who have to worry about the risk of lightning damage, for example nuclear power plants, have had to use data based on -LRB- thunder records -RRB- to develop their risk analyses,'' Changnon said in a telephone interview. `` It's very clear that thunder rather dramatically underestimates the frequency of lightning near a given point,'' he said. Changnon, a weather researcher affiliated with the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Survey </ORGANIZATION> who also teaches at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rochester </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, used electromagnetic detectors to record actual cloud-to-ground flashes of lightning. His report was done in conjunction with his son, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Changnon </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pyle </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>. Detailed thunderstorm records go back to the late 1800s, <PERSON> Changnon </PERSON> said, but they have always depended on the reports of trained observers, who primarily listen for thunder. In recent years, however, electromagnetic detectors have been installed in many areas to record actual lightning strokes. The researchers compared the thunder reports of weather observers with the lightning records from sensors used by the federal <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> in Western states and by electrical utilities along the Eastern seaboard. `` The degree of relationship is relatively weak,'' Changnon reported. `` It gives one a lot of pause, in many respects, about how the atmosphere works, how good our weather records are and how safe we are.'' In the West, Changnon reported, between 31 percent and 40 percent of all lightning strokes were missed by observers listening for thunder. The situation was better in the East, with 22 percent to 26 percent of lightning strokes being missed, the report said. The differences between observations in the East and the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> occurs, at least in part, because of greater problems in hearing thunder in the West, particularly in mountainous areas, he said. Lightning killed 86 Americans last year, the highest death toll in this decade but lower than the annual average of 96, according to records kept by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. The agency counted 365 lightning-related injuries in 1987, about 50 percent higher than the annual average, due largely to a series of strikes that hit groups of people. `` Lightning apparently does not command the respect it deserves as a dangerous killer,'' E. W. Friday, director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, has warned. Friday said only floods compete with lightning in deadliness. Last year's death toll was the most since 88 people died in lightning strikes in 1978. But that falls far short of several deadly years in the 1960s, including 1963 when 210 people were killed by lightning. As usual, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> led the nation with 11 lightning deaths last year. <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> ranked second with 6, followed by 5 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and 4 each in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> each recorded three fatalities. There were two each in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. States recording a single lightning death for the year were <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>.

 Gang violence rages on in the City of Angels and street thugs are expanding their drug trade to other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cities despite police sweeps, a new <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> task force and two `` gang summits.'' More than 200 people have died in gang-related slayings so far this year; 11 people were slain last weekend, and an undercover policeman was shot to death Saturday while tailing suspects in a drive-by shooting. <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> had a record 387 gang-related slayings in 1987, and authorities are expecting more than 420 in 1988, said Deputy District Attorney <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Genelin </PERSON>, head of the district attorney's Hardcore Gang Unit. Drive-by gang killings now average more than one a day and often claim innocent bystanders. Community outcry prompted <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> police to launch a full-scale assault in March. Twice since then, they have marched 1,000 officers into the most gang-infested areas on weekends. The result has been a decline in the overall crime rate, although the gang murder rate continues to climb. `` We're in a holding action. We're keeping the flames from spreading but we're not putting them out,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Philibosian </PERSON>, former district attorney and head of a state task force on gangs and drugs. <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> gangs are expanding their cocaine-trafficking networks as far as <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, law enforcement authorities said. `` We have people coming from <LOCATION> L.A. </LOCATION> to sell cocaine, not to start gangs. It's a business deal here, it's not gangs,'' said <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> police Officer <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Fordice </PERSON>. A <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> gang member was recently sentenced to 25 years in prison in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> for selling drugs near a school, he said. <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> has had eight successful prosecutions of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> gang members for narcotics offenses, said Sgt. <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>. `` It just another brand of slug we have to deal with,'' <PERSON> Fordice </PERSON> sighed. Authorities said it will take much more than cops on corners to make a dent in the 70,000 members of the 600 gangs in the county. `` It's going to take years. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> has worked at stopping the drug problem for 30 years and still has n't stopped it,'' said <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawler </PERSON>, the new <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> chief for <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` It's a form of life to some people. It may be an entire generation before this goes away.'' When <PERSON> Lawler </PERSON> arrived here from <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> two months ago, his first big action was to establish an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> gang unit here because he had begun to see <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>' Bloods and Crips gangs sell cocaine in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON> also created an anti-gang unit of federal and local law enforcement City police will continue the sweeps and will also begin targeting hardcore leaders of the most powerful gangs, said Deputy Police Chief <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Rathburn </PERSON>. A similar effort was conducted in 1979 and 1980, and authorities found that when the leaders were put away, activity in their gangs and their neighborhoods dissipated, <PERSON> Philibosian </PERSON> said. But those leaders are now coming out of prison, he said. Clergy members tried their part this summer by holding two gang summits. The first, in July, attracted about a dozen people. A two-day summit last week drew 50, and some members of the rival Crips and Bloods vowed to lay down their arms, end their gang affiliations and form a network to persuade others to do the same. `` We have intelligence and want a quality education. I know that we're running out of time. ... <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, listen today,'' said gang member <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> <PERSON> Bay </PERSON>, who attended the summit. Officials have criticized the summits for giving a false impression of optimism because the handful of gang members participating do n't represent the 70,000 on the street. But organizers said at least they're doing something. Officials also cautioned it will be a long time before new programs and law enforcement efforts take effect. `` Be patient a little longer,'' said sheriff's Sgt. <PERSON> Wes </PERSON> <PERSON> McBride </PERSON>, who's been fighting gangs for 15 years. `` It will change. We'll get a handle on it, but it wo n't be an overnight thing.''

The group said Mrs. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s annual pension is $ 88,715. She retired in 1973 after more than 30 years in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and has received $ 1,034,914 in retirement benefits, according to the group. In November, former <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> will receive a check putting him over the $ 1 million mark, the group said. He retired in 1971 after 32 years in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and receives an annual pension of $ 81,347. Reifel, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> each made $ 42,500 during their last year in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Current congressional salary is $ 89,500. Congressional retirement pay is derived from a formula that includes the average congressional salary over the last three years. The group said a proposed increase in congressional pay to $ 135,000 next year would greatly increase the number of million-dollar pensions. The taxpayers union, a non-profit organization that says it has 150,000 members interested in reducing government spending and taxes, estimates that for every dollar paid in congressional salaries, 35 cents is paid in congressional pension benefits. It says 85 percent of the retirement funds come from general revenue because the 8 percent that representatives and senators pay into their retirement fund is not enough to cover the benefits. Meanwhile, consumer advocate <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nader </PERSON>, said he was sending a letter to all members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Labor Day reminding them that the national minimum wage has not increased in seven years, while their own salaries have gone up $ 28,838. `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' reluctance to adjust the minimum wage is particularly surprising in light of the diligence it has shown in raising its own pay,'' <PERSON> Nader </PERSON> said in the letter made public Sunday. <PERSON> Nader </PERSON> noted that a worker earning the minimum wage of $ 3.53 an hour would earn $ 6,960 annually, which is $ 4,600 below the poverty level for a family of four.

<HEAD>Bakker Is Readying to Take Over PTL</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> offered assurances Sunday he'll have the money this week to back up his $ 165 million offer for <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from his Fort Mill office that he has been working 15-hour days in anticipation of regaining the TV ministry he left in 1987 in a sex and money scandal. `` We have made quite a few contacts'' with bankers, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said. `` When the contracts -LRB- to take over <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- are ready, we'll have the money to back it up.'' He said he hopes he and his wife, <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON>, will be back on the air on Sept. 12. On Friday, <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> bankruptcy trustee M.C. `` Red'' <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> said he was `` very, very skeptical'' about whether <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> would come up with the cash to back up his offer. If <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> does not have a $ 3 million letter of credit by Tuesday, <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> said, he will start considering other offers for the ministry's assets. A least four other offers ranging from $ 113 million to $ 200 million have been made for <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>, officials said. <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> has a deadline of Saturday to present a buyer to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Rufus </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> for approval. The evangelical empire filed for bankruptcy in June 1987, three months after the scandal over <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s sexual liaison with <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said working out deals with banks is especially difficult during a holiday weekend, but a Midwestern bank, one in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and another in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> are interested in handling the funds from the Greek investors he said are are backing his offer. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> declined to identify the investors or the banks. His lawyer, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Toms </PERSON>, said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Hendersonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, that some banks are leery of involvement because of the controversy surrounding <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, but he feels certain one will cooperate before the week ends. The evangelist said he's readying for the takeover by asking experts for advice on such things as TV production, hotel management, direct mailings, accounting and musical production. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, who was defrocked by the Assemblies of God, said the denomination has `` nothing to do with what we're doing.'' He said he is an ordained minister of the <ORGANIZATION> Faith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fellowship </ORGANIZATION> and the new <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> will be under that church's guidance. He said that he knew some viewers have lost faith in him but that his name recognition has increased dramatically since he left the ministry and he expects to more than make up for the loss. `` Sure we have people who are turning their backs on us and will turn their backs on us,'' he said. `` But we're known by so many millions more. We're excited about it.''

<HEAD>Investigators Refuse to Comment on Double-Engine Failure Theory</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: No further briefings scheduled Sunday.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By KELLEY SHANNON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GRAPEVINE, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Federal investigators wound up their field work at the site of last week's <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> air crash Sunday, refusing to comment on speculation that double engine failure might have led to the disaster. The Dallas Morning News, quoting anonymous sources close to the investigation, reported Sunday that investigators are trying to determine whether two of the three engines on the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 failed in the seconds before Wednesday's crash. `` When someone says engine failure there are a whole host of things that might mean,'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION>, said at a briefing Sunday. `` One of the things I will not do is speculate on anything.'' Some pilots said the fact that the wing flaps on the jet were apparently retracted at the time of the crash, when they ordinarily would have been extended for takeoff, may have been a sign the pilots were trying to fly the plane on one engine, not a cause of the crash, newspapers reported. Thirteen people were killed when Flight 1141 en route to <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> crashed and burned seconds after takeoff at <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. Ninety-five people survived. A recording of cockpit crew members showed they mentioned engine failure. Two loud pops were then heard, which could have indicated a `` compressor stall.'' But <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said a compressor stall, which occurs when an engine is starving for air, is not critical. `` Keep in mind, compressor stall is not serious, it's a hiccup.'' At the site Sunday, investigators sealed the cockpit in a blue tarp. It will be taken to <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> where it will be dismantled and studied. Workers used power saws to remove the landing gear beneath the 727 and also bored into the ground beneath the left wing to determine the amount of fuel that may have spilled during the crash. Two surviving flight attendants were taken to the wreckage and questioned by investigators, <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said. He said he had no immediate information on what they said. <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said he planned to leave <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> later Sunday, and only a few investigators would remain as the center of the inquiry moves to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported that as the plane taxied to the end of the runway, the cockpit crew spoke about previous air crashes including the 1985 Delta Flight 191 crash that killed 137 at the airport. The newspaper said the crew talked about recent reports about a cockpit recording in the crash of a jet last November in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, which revealed the crew members discussing a co-worker's dating habits. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> reported Saturday that the <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> crew members last week joked that they should be careful since their comments could become public if the plane crashed. <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said Saturday night that he had not heard the cockpit voice recording, but added `` if in our analysis we decide that's pertinent information, we'll analyze it. The role of the wing flaps, which are extended during takeoff to provide added lift, continued to be discussed. Flight Engineer <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Judd </PERSON> has told investigators that the wing flaps were extended in the proper position upon takeoff. But evidence collected from the wreckage indicates the flaps were completely or almost completely retracted. `` We have further verification that the flaps were retracted,'' <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said Sunday. The Delta co-pilot, <PERSON> Carey </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, told investigators Saturday that he did not remember anything from when the plane left the gate, <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said. Doctors said the pilot, Capt. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, was not well enough to be interviewed. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON>, a Dallas-based <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> pilot participating in the crash investigation on behalf of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said he believes the pilot could have been facing engine failure and decided to retract the flaps in a last-ditch effort to save the plane. `` A 727 will still fly if it loses one engine, but all 727 pilots know if you lose two engines, the only way you can fly the plane off is to get rid of the flaps,'' <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>, noting the manuever is not approved emergency procedure. `` With two engines out, there's only one way that plane could fly _ with the flaps up.'' <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said he did n't know what the procedure for the pilot would have been if both engines failed. `` Each airline has different operations. As you know, we will be documenting <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>'s procedure.

 Thousands marched in a Serbian city Sunday to protest alleged harassment by ethnic Albanians in the southern province of <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>, one of four weekend rallies that drew more than 100,000, news reports said. Serbs and Montenegrins rallied in four cities during the weekend to protest discrimination against non-Albanians in the province. More than 10,000 people, including a few hundred Serbs and Montenegrins from <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>, held a rally Sunday in <LOCATION> Crvenka </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Vojvodina </LOCATION> province about 125 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION>, the state news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> reported. Demonstrators shouted `` give us weapons, we go to <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>'' and `` army to <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>'' at the weekend rallies, the reports said. Some shouted `` an end to genocide,'' referring to their increasing accusations of persecution of <LOCATION> Serbs </LOCATION> and Montenegrins in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>, where Albanians make up 90 percent of the population. According to official statistics, more than 34,000 Slavs have left <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> since bloody riots in 1981, when the government said nine people were killed. Albanians in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> contend, however, that economic problems are the main factor forcing emigration. Some people at the rally in <LOCATION> Crvenka </LOCATION> sang a song in praise of Serbian <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Slobodan </PERSON> <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>. <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON> wants to increase his republic's control over the nominally autonomous provinces of <LOCATION> Vojvodina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>, and many Serbs and Montenegrins have welcomed the idea as a way of promoting their rights. At the largest demonstration of the weekend, nearly 70,000 rallied Saturday at <LOCATION> Smederevo </LOCATION>, about 30 miles south of <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> said. About 20,000 Serbs have migrated to <LOCATION> Smederevo </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> since World War II. A second rally Saturday brought together more than 20,000 people at <LOCATION> Kovin </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Danube </LOCATION> opposite <LOCATION> Smederevo </LOCATION>, and about 2,000 others demonstrated at <LOCATION> Sombor </LOCATION>, about 90 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION>, the news agency said. The rallies defy pleas from national <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders to refrain from taking the <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> conflict to the streets.

 The leader of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s anti-communist rebels claimed <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> now has 60,000 troops in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and is planning to attack his guerrilla forces within days Rebel leader <PERSON> Jonas </PERSON> <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> has sent 10,000 more soldiers to <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> in recent weeks and the <LOCATION> Cuban-Angolan </LOCATION> forces have used a recent cease-fire to move farther south in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and position themselves for an offensive. `` There are now 60,000 Cubans in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and they are prepared to launch attacks within days,'' <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> said. `` The Cubans did n't come here to wave goodbye It is an initiative for an offensive.'' <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> made his comments Saturday at his headquarters in <LOCATION> Jamba </LOCATION>, a rebel stronghold in southern <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. The Associated Press in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> received a videotape of his remarks. <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> agreed on Aug. 8 to a cease-fire in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s civil war as part of a regional peace initiative, but <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> for the Total Independence of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, known as <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION>, did not participate in the negotiations. <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> granted <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> independence in 1975 and the <ORGANIZATION> Marxist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angola </ORGANIZATION> defeated <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> fighters in a battle for power. <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION>, with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and South African backing, then began a guerrilla campaign and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> sent troops to the southern African country to help the government. <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> has said his guerrillas will continue the war because they were not included in the cease-fire talks that were mediated by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON>. Some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> last week told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> had increased its troop strength in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> to 60,000, but the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Friday it still estimated the Cuban forces at 50,000. A new round of peace talks between <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mediators is scheduled this week in <LOCATION> Brazzaville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Congo </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> said Tuesday that it had withdrawn all of its forces from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. It also said it is prepared to begin withdrawing its troops from <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> on Nov. 1 and to allow the territory to hold independence elections next June 1 if the Cubans are out of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> by June. Sources involved in the last round of negotiations said the Cubans offered to withdraw from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> over a 24-month period. <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, also known as <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, is located between <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and has been administered by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s white-controlled government since the end of World War I under a mandate of the defunct League of Nations The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> repudiated that mandate but <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has rejected <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolutions calling for immediate independence for the territory. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> backing, has insisted that the Cuban forces must first withdraw from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> called the talks dealing with the withdrawal of Cuban and South African troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> `` a cosmetic solution to peace when -LRB- the participants -RRB- know they are going to leave behind a war.''

<HEAD>Two Visions of Vermont Collide in Debate Over Barn Construction</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Two visions of <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> have collided in this picturesque hilltop village of austere white buildings and a village green. One has to do with polished antiques, fine food and weekends of leisure in the countryside; the other has to do with morning chores, rutted pastures and muddy shoes. The dispute is being aired in hearing rooms and involves an effort by a small college here to build a genuine livestock barn within sight of the manicured English gardens of the Inn on the Common, with its croquet lawn, clay tennis court and Adirondack chairs from which guests take in the panoramic view. `` People come here for peace and quiet. They do n't come here to be put in the middle of a farm yard,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmitt </PERSON>, who with his wife, <PERSON> Penny </PERSON>, opened the inn 14 years ago after leaving their jobs in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in investment banking and advertising. Students at <ORGANIZATION> Sterling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, a 75-student school offering programs in farming and forestry served up with a back-to-the-land ethic, are erecting a barn whose rafters can be seen from the Inn's garden The Schmitts' opposition to the barn and a second one planned nearby was dismissed recently by the District 7 <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Johnsbury </LOCATION>. But they have appealed to the state <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Schmitt </PERSON> said the barn violates the artistic intent of the inn, whose gardens were built in the 1930s and are part of a historic district on the National Register of Historic Places. `` The idea is to create not just pretty flower clumps but to create a total outdoor room, if you will,'' she said. `` We are not anti-farming,'' she said. `` This is not a farm versus tourism issue. Tourism and farming are bound together in <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>. People come to <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> to look at the beautiful farms and fields.'' A <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> view can contain barns, she said, `` but you do what is appropriate where you find it.'' Construction permits are granted in <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> under a 1970 development control law written to preserve the state's rural character. A District 7 commission member said this is the first time in his memory that the law has been used to oppose construction of barns. Sterling College President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowen </PERSON> said the school needs the barns to continue its agricultural programs. `` We have tried to do this with the least negative impact as possible on our neighbors,'' he said. In its ruling, the <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> dismissed the Schmitts' concerns about barnyard noises, smells and insects wafting over a fence and onto their property The barn is about 800 feet from the inn. `` Although animals may occasionally be heard at the Inn and at area residences, this noise will be similar to the sounds produced by other farming operations in the area,'' the commission wrote. Legally, construction can go on during the Schmitts' appeal to the state <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. But the college is proceeding at its own risk. On the issue of aesthetics, the commission applied a test in <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> law that bars projects having an `` undue adverse impact.'' It found that while the impact of the barns would be adverse, it would not be undue.

<HEAD>Study: Sweatshops Not A Thing Of The Past</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Sweatshops continue to exist in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, with businesses in the restaurant, apparel manufacturing and meat-processing industries the worst offenders, said a government report released Sunday. The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> report said <PERSON> Hispanics </PERSON> and Asians were the ethnic groups most heavily represented among workers in restaurant and apparel sweatshops. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>, the investigative arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, based its assessment on interviews with more than 100 federal and state officials nationwide surveyed between January and May 1988. The report said some of the reasons cited for multiple labor-law violations were similar to those that existed in the 19th century: a large immigrant work force and low profit margins in labor-intensive industries. Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, who requested the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> study, said the results show `` the ugly side of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> legacy. `` I think most Americans believe sweatshops vanished generations ago, but they are here today, in all parts of the country,'' he said in a statement released with the report. <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON> supported the report's conclusion that penalties for labor law violations must be increased to deter abuses. `` As it stands, employers can violate the minimum wage law and if they get caught they only repay lost wages,'' the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> congressman said. `` Right now, the penalties are n't even a slap on the wrist, they are more like a knowing wink.'' The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> described a sweatshop, a term not defined in federal law or regulations, as `` a business that regularly violates both wage or child labor and safety or health laws.'' The agency excluded from its study industries such as construction and agriculture where work is performed outside of enclosed structures. It also excluded work done in employees' homes. The agency said it received responses to its survey from officials in the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> and all states except <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> also surveyed federal officials: 10 regional administrators of the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Wage and Hour Division, 10 <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> regional officials, and 33 <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> district directors. The restaurant, apparel manufacturing and meat-processing industries were most often cited by these officials as having the most serious problems with labor law violations, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said. Other industries cited were hotel and motel maid services, security agencies, footwear and supermarkets. Officials reported problems in every state except <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. The results of the surveys `` suggest that many workers may be underpaid and working in unsafe or unhealthy conditions,'' the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said. The agency gave no estimate of the total number of workers affected, but said one respondent estimated that half of the approximately 5,000 restaurants in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, employing about 25,000 people, were chronic labor law violators. Another respondent estimated that 25 percent of the 100 apparel manufacturing firms in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, employing about 5,000 workers, are violating labor laws. The officials said problems in the apparel manufacturing and restaurant industries have not improved or have become more serious in the past decade. The report said officials estimated Hispanics represented an average of 53 percent of workers in restaurant sweatshops and an average of 60 percent of workers in apparel manufacturing shops that are chronic labor law violators. The comparable figures for Asians were 25 percent in restaurants and 35 percent in apparel. Examples of the violations found include failure to keep required records of wages, hours worked and injuries; wages below the minimum wage, which currently is $ 3.35 per hour, or failure to pay overtime; illegal work by minors; fire hazards; and work procedures that cause crippling illnesses, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said. The report said limited coordination among enforcement agencies, too few inspectors and inadequate penalties for violations limit efforts to enforce labor laws.

<TEXT>
 With the presidential election nine weeks off, sizable numbers of likely voters say they do n't know much about the candidates and feel the contenders are avoiding the issues, <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION> reported Sunday. A poll conducted for the magazine last week found improvement in Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s ratings for trustworthiness and reliability and declines for Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in terms of trustworthiness and experience. Overall, 47 percent of the 1,103 likely voters nationwide favored <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his running mate, Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, to 42 percent for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The margin of error was three points, meaning the race statistically was a dead heat. That result was among voters who are registered and considered likely to vote. Among all registered voters _ 1,474 of them in the poll _ the race was even tighter: 44 percent for the Republicans, 42 percent for the Democrats. Time's survey, conducted Thursday and Friday, found that public opinion remained largely unformed about the candidates as the campaign enters its final stretch, and large swings in support remained possible. A fifth of the likely voters backing each ticket said they might change their minds. Fully 50 percent of the likely voters said they knew `` not much at all'' about <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and what kind of president he would be, and 29 percent said that about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, despite <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s nearly eight-year tenure as vice president. About half the likely voters said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was `` avoiding the real issues,'' and nearly as many, 44 percent, said that of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who caught up in the polls with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> after the Republican convention last month, was rated favorably by 58 percent of the likely voters, compared to a 49 percent favorable rating for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. Each of the men was rated unfavorably by a third of the likely voters. Moreover, 58 percent rated <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as `` someone you can trust,'' up from 48 percent in a Time poll in April, and 60 percent said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> could handle an international crisis, up from 51 percent in April. Fifty-three percent rated <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as trustworthy, down from 61 percent in April, and 43 percent said he has the experience to be president, down from 53 percent in April. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was rated far better on experience _ 83 percent _ and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was viewed as reliable in a crisis by just 40 percent. However, 72 percent said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> cares about average Americans; 57 percent said so of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Forty percent in the survey rated <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as `` too liberal,'' indicating that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s attacks on ideological grounds have had some effect. But while <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has tied himself to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s record, 51 percent in the poll said they wanted the next president to `` follow different policies,'' to 42 percent who favored continuing <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s policies

 A <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> icebreaker early Sunday freed an oil company research-support vessel stranded in arctic ice, hours after a ship carrying intellectuals on an educational journey got free of the ice by itself, authorities said. The icebreaker Polar Star had been in the <LOCATION> Arctic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> on a mapping mission when it was diverted last week to help the cruise ship Society Explorer, which was hemmed in by the ice. The cruise ship worked free of the ice, but meanwhile the <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION> vessel, the <PERSON> Shaleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON>, reported it was hemmed in about 30 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barrow </LOCATION>. Coast Guard Lt. <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Juneau </LOCATION> said the Polar Star reached the <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION> vessel at about 7 a.m. Sunday and broke it free. The Society Explorer, which had 149 passengers and crew members aboard, is operated by Society Expeditions Cruises of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, which specializes in journeys to unconventional destinations, including <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION>, and emphasizes libraries and lectures. The captain of the ship requested help Thursday when the ship was near <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barrow </LOCATION>. A day later, the <PERSON> Shaleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> reported it also was caught in the Beaufort ice. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said crews reported no danger related to the ice problem. Officials had said the ice is unusually prevalent for this time of year.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> rested up Sunday for the traditional Labor Day kickoff of the presidential campaign while <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential contender <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> stumped in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, telling stock car drivers what the candidates soon will hear _ `` Gentlemen, start your engines.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> ended his Southern swing with a rally in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, where he told the crowd, `` the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> is going for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' `` I ca n't tell you what an upbeat feeling we have had on that Southern swing,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. `` We're going all the way to the White House because we are the party of the future.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, on his second solo campaign trip, visited <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> before traveling to <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, for a Labor Day appearance at <LOCATION> Liberty </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. Democratic nominee <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spent Sunday in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, preparing for a Labor Day tour that includes stops in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. The vice president relaxed in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> before embarking on a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> trip to <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and the biggest electoral prize _ <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> with its 47 votes. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> received encouraging news from the latest <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magazine </ORGANIZATION> poll of 1,103 likely voters nationwide, which found that 47 percent favor the Republican ticket while 42 percent prefer the Democrats. The margin of error was three points, meaning the race statistically was a dead heat. The survey, conducted Thursday and Friday, also found that public opinion about the candidates remained largely unformed, and major swings in the support remained possible. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who caught up in the polls with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> after the Republican convention last month, was rated favorably by 58 percent of the likely voters, compared to a 49 percent favorable rating for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. Each of the men was rated unfavorably by a third of the likely voters. Although the Republican nominee took a respite from campaigning, two of his surrogates used television appearances to lash out at <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' record on education and labor. Education Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, in an appearance on <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Meet the Press,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is a member of an elitist <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> crowd that has `` disdain for the simple and basic patriotism of most Americans,'' including the reciting of the Pledge of Allegiance. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said the pledge is `` the ABCs of education,'' and added: `` If you have trouble with the pledge, you're going to have trouble with a lot of things down the road.'' In 1977, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> vetoed legislation requiring mandatory recitation of the pledge in public schools after <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>' highest court, citing <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> precedent, said the legislation was unconstitutional Last month, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> defended his decision, saying that although he encourages children to say the pledge the issue centered on the measure's constitutionality. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said he lived in that `` Brookline-Cambridge world for eight years,'' referring to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' hometown and the site of <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` These are people who do n't like things like the pledge. They have disdain for the simple and basic patriotism of most Americans.'' Asked if he was accusing <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> of disdain for patriotism, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said, `` I think the crowd with which he runs ... do think they are smarter. You know, they have these advanced attitudes. They do n't like what most Americans think and believe.'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s comments drew cries of foul from former <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidate <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, who described himself as <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' point man on education, and officials in <LOCATION> Brookline </LOCATION>. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as education president would be easier to believe if he had been an education vice president,'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said in a statement. `` There's no evidence <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ever raised his voice, picked up a phone, or lifted a finger to protest the miserable education record of this administration.'' <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Brookline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Selectmen </ORGANIZATION>, demanded an apology from <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>. `` My reaction is one of outrage that the secretary of education on national television sees fit to question the patriotism and committment to this nation of a town of 59,000 people,'' <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said Sunday afternoon. `` I believe he owes this town an apology,'' he said. Labor Secretary <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON>, who appeared on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` This Week With <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkley </PERSON>,'' said she did not see plans that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has had in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> `` that are transferrable to the nation at large.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s running mate took a break from touting the Republican ticket and criticizing the Democrats. <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> attended the Southern 500 stock car race in <LOCATION> Darlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, where he was given the honor of telling the drivers: `` Gentlemen, start your engines.'' At the opening ceremonies of the race, he received a smattering of boos from the audience when he was introduced. Later Sunday, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> attended a private fund-raiser in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> and flew on to <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> where he prepared for the speech he will give Monday morning in the shadow of the Statue of Liberty. Labor Day marks the official countdown to the November election but political events, including the furor over the selection of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, forced the candidates to start in earnest earlier this year. The contest remains close as reflected in three state polls released Sunday. In <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' nearly 2-1 early summer lead has disappeared and he now leads <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, 47-42 percent. The Des Moines Register poll of 687 likely voters, conducted Aug. 23-31, had a margin of error of 3.8 percentage points. In the same poll taken in June, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> led <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> by a 60-28 percent margin. In a survey conducted for the <ORGANIZATION> Wilmington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-Journal </ORGANIZATION> papers in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> led <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> 38 percent to 34 percent with 28 percent of the 1,824 registered voters undecided. The poll, conducted Aug. 19-26, had a margin of error of 3 percentage points. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also led <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in a poll of 502 registered voters in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>. The survey for the <ORGANIZATION> Birmingham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> found <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> favored by 50.7 percent and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> by 34 percent. The survey, with a margin of error of 5 percentage points, was conducted Aug. 27-31.

Reynolds, one of the nation's largest cigarette manufacturers and a subsidiary of Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, began selling the new brand last week to distributors, supermarkets and discount chains in the three cities. Company spokesmen say the product simulates smoking by heating a capsule containing tobacco flavor pellets instead of tobacco. When a smoker lights the cigarette, heat filters through the pellets and the little bit of tobacco packed around the unit. It produces no odor and only a trace of ash or smoke that could irritate people nearby, the company says. It also reportedly contains fewer of what <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> calls `` controversial compounds,'' the hazardous byproducts associated with cigarette smoke.

<HEAD>Two Palestinians Appeal Deportation Orders At Public Hearing</HEAD>

<DATELINE>GAZA CITY, Occupied Gaza Strip (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two Palestinians fighting deportation orders pleaded their case Sunday in an open hearing _ the first time the army permitted the public to attend an appeals session. Defense lawyers lauded the army's decision but said due process was still being violated because prosecutors could submit `` secret evidence'' without having to show it to the defense. <PERSON> Said </PERSON> <PERSON> Barakat </PERSON>, 32, a Moslem fundamentalist leader, and <PERSON> Riad </PERSON> <PERSON> Adjour </PERSON>, 26, accused of being a <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> activist, are among 25 Palestinians from the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> fighting deportation orders issued last month. Since the Dec. 8 start of the Palestinian uprising in the occupied territories, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has expelled 33 Arabs. The practice has been denounced by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other Western nations as violating international human rights conventions. `` There is no hope, no justice for me here, but I do n't want to go without fighting,'' <PERSON> Barakat </PERSON> told the tribunal. The hearing before a three-member military review committee took place at the army's <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> headquarters and was attended by three journalists and about two dozen relatives of the defendants. <PERSON> Barakat </PERSON> and <PERSON> Adjour </PERSON> sat quietly on a wooden bench as the prosecutor, Capt. <PERSON> Meir </PERSON> <PERSON> Klinger </PERSON>, read the charges against them. <PERSON> Klinger </PERSON> said <PERSON> Barakat </PERSON>, a high school teacher from the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> town of <PERSON> Bani </PERSON> <PERSON> Suheila </PERSON>, was a chief ideologust of <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jihad </ORGANIZATION>, a Moslem fundamentalist organization pledged to the destruction of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. He also said that <PERSON> Barakat </PERSON>, who was arrested May 11, signed a 15-page statement in which he acknowledged writing underground leaflets inciting anti-Israeli violence. `` We had enough evidence to put him on trial,'' <PERSON> Klinger </PERSON> told the panel. `` Instead, we decided to deport him because experience has shown that fanatic <PERSON> Islamic </PERSON> leaders usually continue their hostile activities in jail.'' The prosecutor said <PERSON> Adjour </PERSON> was a <ORGANIZATION> Palistine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> activist who led outlawed `` popular committees'' of Palistinian miliants in the <LOCATION> Daraj </LOCATION> neighborhood of <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Klinger </PERSON> claimed Adjour distributed <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> funds and ordered the burnings of stores whose owners ignored strike orders. In both cases <PERSON> Klinger </PERSON> submitted `` secret evidence,'' which usually involves reports by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Shin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bet </PERSON> security service. The defense is barred from seeing such evidence on security grounds. `` You ca n't argue against secret evidence,'' said <PERSON> Fayez </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahme </PERSON>, one of the defense lawyers and head of the <ORGANIZATION> Gaza </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lawyers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. After defense lawyers present their case in a separate session the review panel will issue its recommendations. If it upholds the deportation orders the defendants can appeal to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>.

 Education Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> on Sunday accused Democratic presidential candidate <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> of running with a crowd that has `` disdain for the simple and basic patriotism of most Americans.'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, who leaves the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration later this month, vowed to dog <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on educational issues and accused the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor of offering only `` empty, general, bland platitudes'' on education. Speaking on <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Meet the Press,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>'s record on education consists of his `` veto of the Pledge of Allegiance. In 1977, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor vetoed a measure requiring mandatory recitation of the pledge in public schools after the state's highest court, citing <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> precedent, said the legislation was unconstitutional. `` I encourage children to say the Pledge of Allegiance,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said during a campaign stop last month. `` I say the Pledge of Allegiance. That's not the issue. The Republicans know it. ... That law was unconstitutional.'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> called the pledge `` the ABCs of education,'' adding, `` If you have trouble with the pledge, you're going to have trouble with a lot of things down the road.'' `` I lived in that <LOCATION> Brookline-Cambridge </LOCATION> world for eight years,'' he said, referring to the town where <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> lives and the site of <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` These are people who do n't like things like the pledge. They have disdain for the simple and basic patriotism of most Americans,'' said <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>. Asked if he was accusing <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> of having disdain for patriotism, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said, `` I think the crowd with which he runs ... do think they are smarter. You know, they have these advanced attitudes. They do n't like what most Americans think and believe.'' <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Brookline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Selectmen </ORGANIZATION>, later expressed `` outrage that the secretary of education on national television sees fit to question the patriotism and commitment to this nation of a town of 59,000 people.'' `` I believe he owes this town an apology,'' <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said. Democratic Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' point man on education issues, responded to <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s comments with a critique of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s track record on education. `` There's no evidence <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ever raised his voice, picked up a phone, or lifted a finger to protest the miserable education record of this administration,'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> defended his political statements as consistent with positions he has taken as education secretary and said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign paid for his recent trip to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> where he attacked <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on education. `` I think what <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is talking about is going to keep the educational reform movement moving. What <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is talking about is empty, general, bland platitudes,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Venereal diseases have spread to every city in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and medical experts are calling for more action to fight the worsening problem, an official report said Sunday. The daily newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> said the number of VD patients has increased steadily since the late 1970s, when <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> began opening its doors to foreigners. It said the problem has spread from a few coastal cities, which have more contacts with foreigners, to almost every city in the country. In southern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION>, the number of VD victims, most of whom were under the age of 20, quadrupled in 1987 from the previous year, the paper said. The report blamed the spread of the diseases to the closing of VD clinics in the early 1960s _ when venereal diseases were virtually wiped out _ and to the lack of education about the diseases, backward medical equipment and treatment, and lax enforcement of the ban on prostitution. It suggested that a national body with representatives from public security, the judiciary, civil affairs, the women's federation, the tourist industry and the public health sector be set up to prevent and treat venereal diseases Laws and regulations should be tightened to ban prostitution, and sufferers should be compelled to get medical treatment, the paper said.

<TEXT>
 Residents frustrated by the city's failure to clean up their neighborhood flipped some abandoned cars over and pushed others into intersections, and one of the 23 vehicles caught fire, police said. Angry residents of the impoverished north side neighborhood took to the streets in a frenzy of protest Saturday when city trash trucks drove by without picking up garbage from a cleanup effort, police said. Capt. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said police were looking for the group of 15 or so men involved in the spree, but no arrests had been made by Sunday morning. No injuries were reported. The protest was apparently triggered by the botched cleanup effort and frustration over the hundreds of abandoned cars that litter the area's streets and never get towed. `` There's cars here for six months,'' said neighbor <PERSON> Stella </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>. `` You call and you call and nothing gets done. They were told the only way the city would pick up the abandoned cars was if they're in the middle of the streets.''

<HEAD>Aquino Says People Oppose Return of Marcos</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said Sunday that many Filipinos oppose the return of ousted ruler <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and have vowed to hold demonstrations if he comes back. In her weekly radio program, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said her government would comply if the courts ruled that <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> could return from exile in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. But she said there has been no such ruling because no criminal charges have been filed against him. A military-civilian uprising in February 1986 ousted <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and carried Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> to power. Two weeks ago, <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> filed a petition with a <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> court asking that he be allowed to return and confront a former <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> member scheduled to testify in November on alleged corruption during the his 20-year rule. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has refused to allow <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to return, citing national security. `` Many people have sent letters and called up on the phone to tell me that they do n't want <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to come back yet,'' she said Sunday. `` Some people have sent word to me that they would go out into the streets to protest the return of <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>.'' The government has been seeking to recover up to $ 10 billion that it claims <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and his associates plundered from the country but it has not filed criminal charges against <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. Under Philippine law, a defendant's presence is required in criminal proceedings. `` Since no criminal charges have been filed against the former president, there is really no necessity yet for the courts to probably call for him,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> had filed the petition seeking to return after the anti-corruption court granted the solicitor-general's request for a special hearing to `` perpetuate'' the testimony of former <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Baltazar </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. <PERSON> Baltazar </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, who is not related to the president, had served in <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' Cabinet. Government lawyers have said he will testify about millions of dollars <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> allegedly received in kickbacks from Japanese firms. The lawyers said <PERSON> Baltazar </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s testimony must be taken soon because he is ill. The court did say <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> has the right to defend himself in the proceedings that will begin Nov. 7 because the solicitor-general declared he intended to use testimony in the hearing in a future criminal suit against <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. The government has asked the court to reject <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' petition. On Thursday the court gave <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> 10 days to submit a written reply to the government's motion.

The <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> talks are to arrange follow-up procedures for the cease-fire that took effect Aug. 20 after nearly eight years of fighting.

 Changes in emergency procedures that were implemented after the <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> Flight 191 tragedy three years ago helped make a smooth response to last week's crash, an official said Sunday. `` This emergency response appears to be one of the most effective that I've ever seen,'' said <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roman </PERSON>, a representative of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Executives </ORGANIZATION> and a member of the `` survival factors'' group of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> team investigating Wednesday's crash. <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> Flight 1141 crashed and burned on takeoff at <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, killing 13. Ninety-five people, including the three members of the cockpit crew, survived as the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 skidded to rest at the end of a runway. `` It would appear that on first impression that this response was excellent,'' Roman said. `` I do n't know of any screw-ups at all in the whole operation.'' He stressed that he was not speaking on behalf of the investigation, but as a representative of the airport executives association. Roman said changes made in emergency response procedures at the airport since the Aug. 2, 1985, crash of <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> Flight 191, including installation of cellular telephones in ambulances, helped in evacuating survivors. Also, he said, an automated telephone system implemented at the airport's Department of Public Safety office reduced the time it took to notify rescue workers after the crash. Those procedures resulted from <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> recommendations made after the 1985 crash, which resulted in 137 deaths, <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> said. Meanwhile, eight crash survivors were released from hospitals Saturday. Some recalled the crash and rescue operation, which they said involved little panic. <PERSON> Stella </PERSON> <PERSON> Grigg </PERSON>, at age 80 the oldest person on the downed plane, said she was pushed out of the aircraft through a hole near the cockpit and caught by a group of men on the ground. `` I was thrust forward and back, even though I had a seat belt on,'' she said. `` The plane tipped to the left and tipped to the right and just skidded along.''

 An ex-policeman convicted in a pension fund scandal surrendered Sunday, 25 hours after taking the police official who exposed the scam hostage on the 15th floor of an office building, authorities said. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniele </PERSON>, armed with an unidentified weapon, released <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, vice president of the city police board, early Sunday and gave up 10 hours later. A day before the standoff, <PERSON> Daniele </PERSON> was sentenced to eight years in prison. Authorities said <PERSON> Daniele </PERSON> had two guns, one that he brought with him and another that he got from <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s desk. He told police that he had used explosives to booby-trap the door to the office where he held <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, but police said that turned out not to be true. `` At about 11 a.m. this morning, he said ` I'm tired, I'm coming out,''' said police spokeswoman <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Hancock </PERSON>. <PERSON> Daniele </PERSON>, 39, who was once a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s hostage-response team, was with his attorney when he surrendered, authorities said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, 53, was apparently unharmed, police said. A hostage-response team and dozens of officers who had surrounded the building had negotiated with <PERSON> Daniele </PERSON>, said Ms. <PERSON> Hancock </PERSON>. <PERSON> Daniele </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolff </PERSON>, told radio station <ORGANIZATION> KMOX </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Daniele </PERSON> gave up after an agreement was reached not to file any further charges against him.

Col. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hackett </PERSON>. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> exposed a kickback scandal that cost police and fire pension funds an estimated $ 333,000. On Friday, <PERSON> Daniele </PERSON> was sentenced to eight years in prison and ordered to make restitution of $ 200,000 for his part in the scam. He was convicted of extortion, conspiracy and mail fraud, and could have received 32 years in prison. He was free pending an appeal when the incident began, authorities said. The scam was carried out by paying a brokerage artificially high commissions on stock transactions that were made with pension funds, prosecutors said. Participants in the scheme were then given back part of the money. <PERSON> Daniele </PERSON>, who headed the police pension fund, was the only one of six men indicted to stand trial. The others pleaded guilty to lesser charges and also were sentenced Friday. Attorney <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anton </PERSON>, who was considered the mastermind of the plan, was sentenced to nine years in prison. The others were sentenced to prison terms ranging from six months to three years.

 Smoke was billowing and about 150 people were evacuated both in and around <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> National Park on Sunday, but more than 200 square dancers decided the show must go on. A 57,000-acre fire closing in on the park's northeastern entrance apparently did not faze about 250 square dancers, who gathered on the west edge of the park for the 33rd annual Knothead Jamboree. `` Square dancers are tough. We can take what they dish out,'' said <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Rae </PERSON> <PERSON> Bronson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Shelley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, who is that state's chairwoman for this year's event `` Or else we're Knotheads. That's what we're called. The dancers come from <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and have held their jamboree each Labor Day weekend at West Yellowstone since 1980. This year's attendance `` is about half what we had last year because of the fire,'' Ms. <PERSON> Bronson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missoula </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> co-chairman, said attendance at the jamboree usually numbers closer to 800. `` It would've been too late to move it ... or cancel unless it would have been an emergency situation or evacuation of the town,'' she said. So they pressed ahead with the festival, which began Saturday and is to conclude Monday. But the event was hurt financially by the low attendance and may not break even this year, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. The never-say-die square dancers had reserved a hall in the Fly Fishing Center, which meant that fire officials, who had set up a fire information center there, were obliged to move their operation into two nearby tents until the jamboree ends. Meanwhile, tourists continued flocking to the nation's oldest park, despite weeks of headline-making fires. `` We've never been here before. We just decided we wanted to see <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Kistner </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Carmi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>. His wife, <PERSON> Esther </PERSON>, said they knew what to expect because they had been following the fires' progress on television, but decided not to let that interfere with their plans `` We wanted to try it anyway,'' she said. `` We got to see everything we intended to see,'' <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Kistner </PERSON> said.

 An official is promising to close a legal loophole that allowed the city's first bullfights to take place over the weekend, but Hispanics argue that a ban will strip them of their culture and heritage. `` We're going back to the drawing board on Tuesday,'' to figure out how to ban bullfights, said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Poholik </PERSON>, executive director of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> and Control. About 300 people viewed bloodless bullfights in a temporary arena set up as part of a Hispanic festival Saturday. Four matadors confronted three 1,000-pound bulls, using the traditional capes. But instead of being killed, the animals had Velcro patches glued to their backs to grab onto the matadors' Velcro-covered swords and darts `` The cruelest thing they're doing is teasing the animal,'' <PERSON> Poholik </PERSON> said. `` It's not right but it's not physically harming the animal. We've got enough of animal exploitation. We do n't need this,'' he said in a telephone interview Sunday. Bullfighting is not permitted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, but three states _ <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> _ have allowed the bloodless variety, <PERSON> Poholik </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> has an ordinance to prevent bullfights. But <ORGANIZATION> Cook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Albert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> on Friday ordered the city to grant a permit to <ORGANIZATION> Jaass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Productions </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> to stage the exhibition because the bulls are not killed. `` I'm going to work with the mayor and city attorneys and get an amendment to an ordinance so we can ban bull baiting,'' the commissioner said. `` This bloodless bullfight is just another form of teasing and torment.'' But <PERSON> Rodolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Mancilla </PERSON>, an aide to state Rep. <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, who helped arrange the festival, said bullfighting is part of Hispanic culture. `` They've already taken away our language in schools,'' he said. `` Now they want to take away our folklore, tradition, heritage, culture. You just ca n't keep doing that and have people stand for it.'' <PERSON> Poholik </PERSON>, who watched Saturday's bullfight with an investigator from his staff and state officials, said the animals were not treated harshly. `` The promoters kept their word. There was no blood drawn,'' <PERSON> Poholik </PERSON> said. `` The animals were in excellent condition _ well fed. There was a good corral area. You could tell they were well cared for.'' Many of the spectators were also concerned about the animals. `` Most of the people were rooting for the bulls,'' <PERSON> Poholik </PERSON> said. `` They cheered when the matadors got knocked down.'' The bulls' ultimate destination is the butcher shop, said breeder <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Correla </PERSON>. The animals `` learn quickly'' and can only be used for one bullfight, he said. `` We use them for hamburger.''

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s government passed a key test in its bid to overhaul <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s tax system when the governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> scored twin victories Sunday in a provincial election. Final results Monday in conservative <PERSON> Fukushima </PERSON> province gave the Liberal Democrats the governorship and a seat in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>'s upper House of Councilors. Officials said 81.2 percent of the eligible voters cast ballots _ a record for <PERSON> Fukushima </PERSON>. <PERSON> Eisaku </PERSON> <PERSON> Sato </PERSON> won the gubernatorial race with 685,791 votes compared to 461,350 for <PERSON> Toshio </PERSON> <PERSON> Hirose </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> rebel who opposed the tax changes, and communist candidate <PERSON> Masaru </PERSON> <PERSON> Kusano </PERSON> who polled 61,630 votes in the northern province. Liberal Democrat <PERSON> Kentaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Ishihara </PERSON> won the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Councilors </ORGANIZATION> seat with 702,940 votes to 312,203 for <PERSON> Kazuo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ishiga </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and 186,503 for <PERSON> Yumiko </PERSON> <PERSON> Abe </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The victories were a boost to the governing party's attempt to reform tax laws to include a controversial 3 percent consumption tax on nearly all goods and services. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> has staked his political life on the success of the tax measure. He said this year, `` I am prepared to take political responsibility if the tax reform can not be realized.'' It is <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s third attempt to overhaul a tax system drafted by American occupation officials shortly after World War II. Previous failures dealt embarrassing political setbacks to two of <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s predecessors. Opposition parties had hoped to spark nationwide resistance to the consumption tax, making the governor's election a showdown on the reform proposals. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s party had not officially endorsed either <PERSON> Sato </PERSON> or <PERSON> Hirose </PERSON> in the gubernatorial campaign. `` The results have stirred high interest ... they will exert great influence on the tax reform,'' said a statement from <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> on <PERSON> Ishihara </PERSON>'s victory. `` As the governing party we have taken the long view and advocated the necessity of tax reform. We gained the voters' understanding with our efforts,'' <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> said The <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> blamed the governing party for its defeat. `` The conservative <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s disunity alone was emphasized by its skillful concealment and ambiguous treatment of the consumption tax,'' Secretary General <PERSON> Tsuruo </PERSON> <PERSON> Yamaguchi </PERSON> said in a statement. The conservative victories stymied opposition hopes of building up momentum against the tax reform. Last year, a gubernatorial victory by the Socialists in another conservative stronghold prompted nationwide protests that led to the defeat of then-Premier <PERSON> Yasuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON>'s tax reform proposals. Faced with a political opposition united against the tax plan, however, <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s government has managed to win agreement only on initial cuts in income taxes. Parliamentary deliberation on the rest of the package has been stalled by a stock-profit scandal involving several politicians and aides. The package calls for reducing <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s heavy reliance on direct taxes by trimming income and corporate taxes and introducing the consumption tax. Critics say the plan falls short of the government's goal of easing inequities in the present system and preventing future increases in the consumption tax rate. Although the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> hold commanding majorities in both houses of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s parliament, tradition and popular resistance have kept the party from ramming through the proposals.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> on Sunday accused the Hungarian news media of distorted coverage of events in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> even after the leaders of the two communist countries agreed to try to improve relations. A major issue that has strained relations is <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s plan to raze some 7,000 villages, including hundreds of communities populated mainly by ethnic Hungarians, and resettle the people in agro-industrial centers as part of a land reform program. There are about 1.7 million ethnic Hungarians in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, which has a population of 23 million. An editorial in <LOCATION> Scinteia </LOCATION>, the newspaper of the <ORGANIZATION> Romanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said the <LOCATION> Hungarian </LOCATION> media is `` becoming the echo of hostile, chauvinistic and nationalistic circles and groups.'' Romanian President <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> met with Hungarian Premier <PERSON> Karoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> in the Romanian town of <PERSON> Arad </PERSON> a week ago in the first top-level meeting between the two countries in eleven years. <PERSON> Scinteia </PERSON> said <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> told <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> the Hungarian media `` distort in their coverage the situation in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, give accounts that are not real, including the program of modernization and organization of settlements of the country, of improvement of the Romanian people's living standard.'' It reported <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> also said those programs `` are internal matters, the resolution of which is the exclusive concern of our party, of the Romanian people.'' The editorial said: `` The Romanian people are outraged by such gross attempts -LRB- by the Hungarian media -RRB- to falsify the Romanian realities and denigrate the Romanian policy, and most firmly disapproves of such practices.'' Some Hungarian officials have called <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s resettlement plan, which is to be completed by the year 2000, idiotic and `` a crime against mankind.''

 A 110-degree reading tied the city's all-time record Sunday and the heat drove hundreds of thousands to beaches for the Labor Day weekend, causing power outages and helping feed a swarm of brushfires. To the north, Grants Pass, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, broke a 33-year-old record of 103 degrees with a 107-degree reading, and <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, baked under a third day of record-breaking temperatures _ this time with a little smoke added. The last time the temperature reached 110 in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> was Sept. 1, 1955. The temperature easily beat the record high for the date of 100 set in 1984. To the south, a record for the date of 107 was set at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Lindbergh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION>, surpassing a 1961 record of 95. Other triple-digit temperatures in southern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> were <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, 104; <LOCATION> Burbank </LOCATION>, 106; <ORGANIZATION> Fullerton </ORGANIZATION>, 108; and <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>, 110. Riverside and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION>, usually the inland hot spots, were cooler with 104 and 106 degrees, respectively. The hottest spot in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Sunday was about 300 miles northeast of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bluff </ORGANIZATION>, which posted a record 118 degrees. Beach highways were jammed, with no parking available anywhere, observers said. Guards at beaches near <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> estimated some 775,000 people took to the sand, while lifeguards at <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION> beaches in <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> reported 207,000 people. It was so crowded `` you could probably hop from blanket to blanket to avoid the hot sand ... play beach blanket bingo on your way to the water,'' said <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> lifeguard <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Balok </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> reported 1,000 customers without electricity due to peak demand from air conditioners that knocked out 425 transformers. Power outages also were reported in <LOCATION> Watts </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Hancock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, home of Mayor <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, but they were not believed caused by demand related to the heat, said <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jensen </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the city's <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION>. As the heat raged, so did the brush fires. Fast moving blazes were reported in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Riverside </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Orange </PERSON>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ventura </LOCATION> counties, with more than 2,800 acres charred. Sunday was the second day of the southern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> heat wave. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> predicted lower temperatures for the coast Monday, but continued high temperatures in inland areas for Labor Day, with some relief reaching inland Tuesday. Other highs in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> Sunday included 103 at <LOCATION> Medford </LOCATION>, 102 at <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dalles </ORGANIZATION> and 101 at <LOCATION> Hermiston </LOCATION>, none of which were records. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION> hit 96, four degrees higher than the previous record for the date set in 1963, the weather service said. It was the third day in a row that a daily record high was broken, with Saturday's maximum of 98 equalling the all-time high temperature for September. <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION> residents also had to put up with smoky skies from the forest fires burning in the northeast part of the state.

 Electricity flowed downtown again Sunday after a three-day blackout that halted elevators in high-rises, thawed frozen food and shut down air conditioners during one of the hottest weeks in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> history. Power was finally restored to much of the 50-block area Saturday night, but <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Light </LOCATION> asked customers to conserve power and not turn on air conditioners until two more fire-damaged cables could be repaired. Three days without electricity had taken their toll. `` Too many problem, too many problems,'' said <PERSON> Dae </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> as he slowly began turning on the dozen coolers in his grocery and deli. `` I've got a headache.'' About half the blacked-out area's customers began receiving power via four repaired feeder cables at 6:47 p.m. Saturday. By Sunday night, 90 percent of the affected customers had power back, but there were load restrictions on four buildings, said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Aguirre </PERSON>, a spokesman for the city-owned utility. Crews still were working on restoring a fifth feeder cable, and the sixth feeder was expected to be brought back into service Monday or later, <PERSON> Aguirre </PERSON> said. Until then, many buildings will have only partial power, since they receive electricity from a combination of the cables, said <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> McIntosh </PERSON>, another City Light spokesman. At the twin towers of the 875-room Westin Hotel, for example, full service was restored to the south tower early Sunday, while the north tower remained on a generator, rented for $ 6,200 a week, marketing director <PERSON> Dell </PERSON> <PERSON> Schooly </PERSON> said. The six cables were destroyed Wednesday by an unexplained underground fire. City Light Superintendent <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON> said the fire apparently started in the City Light cables, in which power should have been cut off by automatic current limiters that act when a cable gets hot. Electricity also continued to flow through a nearby <ORGANIZATION> Metro </ORGANIZATION> transit cable, powering electric trolleys, and that may have made the fire worse, he said. When the power restoration began, patrols roamed the area to make sure no fires were triggered by equipment left switched on when the outage began. `` It went very smoothly. I have no reports of problems other than the sprinkler in the Battery Street tunnel,'' which apparently began wetting down the tunnel when it was tripped by the power surge, <PERSON> McIntosh </PERSON> said. `` We called the fire department and told them it was their problem.'' Air conditioning was lost as temperatures soared to a September record of 98 degrees Friday and to a record for the date of 92 on Saturday. Sunday dawned with a cool fog and a forecast high of only 80 to 85. City Light had no estimate of its costs to restore power or of damage from the fire. `` Our field people were really extending themselves, a lot of them volunteering to go 16 hours, double shifts, until they could get the thing done,'' <PERSON> McIntosh </PERSON> said. No injuries were reported and stepped-up police patrols were credited with preventing break-ins. At the height of the blackout, city officials estimated that 90 percent of all businesses in the area were closed. The area has about 130 restaurants, 55 shops in the popular Pike Place Market, the large <PERSON> Bon </PERSON> <PERSON> Marche </PERSON> department store and several hotels, grocery stores and taverns. Pike Place Market businesses saw a drop in traffic, even though many shops never lost electricity. `` People think the whole market is closed,'' said <PERSON> Garth </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> of <PERSON> Jack </PERSON>'s Fish Spot. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> served three meals a day to 150 to 250 elderly residents stuck in the darkened area. Volunteers had to take some meals up 13 flights in buildings where elevators were out of operation.

<TEXT>
 Residents outside the northeastern entrance to <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> were told to evacuate Sunday as hundreds of firefighters mounted a `` last-ditch effort to save this town,'' and a spokeswoman said the situation within the park was deteriorating. `` It's going to be a siege for the next 48 hours,'' said <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaunert </PERSON>, a fire information officer. More than 50 fire engines stood by to protect homes in Silver Gate and nearby <LOCATION> Cooke </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> as the 57,000-acre fire approached from the west. <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> disaster coordinator <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Fry </PERSON> said about 150 people were being evacuated. `` We were threatened with evacuation two weeks ago, so I packed then,'' <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesensway </PERSON> said in the doorway of her rented cabin. `` I've been packed ever since.'' Bulldozers carved a 65-foot-wide fire line through forest just west of here, and nearly 500 firefighters helped dig the line by hand. Crews planned to set a `` backfire'' to cut off the main fire's fuel source. `` We're creating a massive buffer in a last-ditch effort to save this town,'' <PERSON> Kaunert </PERSON> said. `` We need two miles of buffer in front of the fire to hold it. Two miles of black.'' The blazes now cover some 910,000 acres of the greater <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> area, including 611,000 acres within the park itself, or more than one-fourth of <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>'s 2.2 million total acreage. Within Yellowstone itself, firefighters Sunday tried to save wooden foot bridges and protect a campground. `` This situation is growing increasingly more serious day by day,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Anzelmo </PERSON>. `` It is a magnitude that no one in their wildest imagination or scientific predictions could have suggested.'' <PERSON> Anzelmo </PERSON> added that without help from the weather, no amount of money spent by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> or the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> will help douse the blazes. Winds were relatively calm Sunday, but forecasts called for variable winds up to 30 mph later in the week. `` Mother Nature is making the decisions here,'' said <PERSON> Anzelmo </PERSON>. Some <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> firefighters criticized the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> for allowing fires to burn uncontrolled earlier this summer despite dry conditions. Officials said at the time that it was their policy not to fight lightning-caused fires in the wilderness, which they consider a natural part of forest re-generation. <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> <PERSON> Vanderbilt </PERSON>, another park spokeswoman, said the firefighters do n't understand the problem. `` What these firefighters who are coming in -LRB- from other states -RRB- may not realize is that firefighters were on that -LRB- North Fork -RRB- fire within 15 minutes after it started,'' she said in a telephone interview from park headquarters at <LOCATION> Mammoth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hot </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyo </LOCATION>. `` Because of the extremely dry conditions, that fire grew amazingly fast and beyond anyone's expectations,'' she said. Elsewhere Sunday, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state's most serious forest fires ballooned to more than 12,500 acres, sending smoke and ash over the town of <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> but posing no immediate threat. In Silver Gate, a sheriff's department vehicle drove down the street at 8 a.m., its siren blaring. Authorities knocked on doors and phoned people, asking them to leave. Under <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> law, officials can not force anyone to evacuate. <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> watched the firefighters march by and said he was staying. `` There's no real reason to leave,'' he said. `` I do n't think the town's going to burn. Inside the Log Cabin Cafe, the owners dashed around, preparing to close up and get out. `` I'm angry,'' said co-owner <PERSON> Cecile </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>. `` We have been battling with the <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> since the first of July -LRB- to do more -RRB-, and now the fires are threatening every town around the park.'' The lightning-sparked fire threatening Silver Gate has been burning June 14. Under Forest Service policy for naturally occurring fires, the blaze was allowed to burn as long as it remained within certain boundaries. But in mid-August, wind gusting to 70 mph blew the fire across several miles in a matter of hours, and a human-caused fire to the west also gained ground. That fire now stands at nearly 54,000 acres, and officials expect the two blazes to merge. As of Sunday, they were two miles apart. Elsewhere, in northeastern <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, firefighters battling a 9,100-acre fire northeast of <PERSON> Libby </PERSON> `` had a pretty quiet night'' but still had no deadline for containment, said <ORGANIZATION> Kootenai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Guth </PERSON>. <PERSON> Guth </PERSON> said 1,600 firefighters were stymied by `` unbelievably hot, dry conditions. It is hard to say when we'll be able to get a line that will hold.'' Hot, dry weather and a smoky haze that covered much of <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> continued to hamper efforts to contain four major fires that have blackened more than 80,000 acres of forest and grassland. Crews and pumper trucks were stationed around several ranches as firefighters expected the largest of the fires to jump the boundaries of the <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Church-River </PERSON> of No Return Wilderness and move onto private property. In southern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, wildfires blackened nearly 3,000 acres of brush and timber and damaged at least 21 structures as searing, dry weather and <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ana </LOCATION> winds harried firefighters and ignited new flames. Temperatures neared 110 degrees throughout the region, humidity was low, and gusty northeasterly desert winds rolled through canyons and hills. In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, firefighters mopped up hot spots from a 600-acre blaze whose sparks scorched the roofs of at least 20 hilltop homes. Arcing power lines caused a fire about 15 miles northeast of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. A total of 21 homes were damaged by that blaze, which forced the evacuation of 150 people from a mobile home park, authorities said. In <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, firefighters received a break from calm winds to help keep a raging, 4,000-acre brush fire away from more than 70 canyon homes east of <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, authorities said.

 Floods have inundated three-quarters of this impoverished nation, stranding at least 20 million people who are eating raw food and drinking muddy, probably contaminated water, officials said Sunday. At least 882 people have died since June, when rivers began overflowing their banks in annual monsoon flooding in this country of 110 million people, according to newspapers in <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>. The government count of 333 dead is widely considered low. `` It is a calamity,'' Information Minister <PERSON> Mahbubur </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON> told reporters Sunday night. `` It is a havoc-creating, menacing flood.''

 The most negative political advertising campaign ever is likely this fall from two presidential candidates who are close in the polls, close on the issues and far from shy about going on the offensive.

But viewers should n't expect sunshine and roses on the air.

 Federal investigators wound up their field work at the site of last week's <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> air crash Sunday, refusing to comment on speculation that double engine failure might have led to the disaster. The Dallas Morning News, quoting anonymous sources close to the investigation, reported Sunday that investigators are trying to determine whether two of the three engines on the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 failed in the seconds before Wednesday's crash. `` When someone says engine failure there are a whole host of things that might mean,'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION>, said at a briefing Sunday. `` One of the things I will not do is speculate on anything.''

 As any casual follower of the stock market knows, a lot of the market's recent woes have been blamed on rising interest rates. But it is the way rates have been rising, even more than the simple fact that they have been moving up, that particularly troubles some analysts. With several nudges from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>, short-term interest rates -LRB- on debt securities with lives of a year or less -RRB- have climbed more sharply of late than long-term rates -LRB- on bonds with maturities of up to 30 years -RRB-. That means that what Wall Streeters call the yield curve, a graphic representation of the relationship between short - and long-term rates, is flattening If it inverts _ that is, if short-term rates go higher than long-term rates _ many analysts believe it would be a sign of significant trouble for both the stock market and the economy. Normally, interest rates on long-term debt tend to be higher than on short-term loans because long-term borrowers expose themselves to greater risk that the purchasing power of their money will be eroded by inflation, or that the issuer of the debt will default. So when the yield curve tilts in the opposite direction, it is widely taken as a sign that something is out of whack. Inverted yield curves showed up early in the bear markets and recessions that occurred in 1973-74 and again at the beginning of the 1980s. `` If the yield curve inverts, there is a very high probability that a recession will follow,'' said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Berge </PERSON> <PERSON> Kent </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Tucker </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anthony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; R.L. <ORGANIZATION> Day </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, in a recent commentary. Recently, she noted, the ratio of rates on three-month <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills to those on 30-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds stood at .78. `` If the ratio rises above .80 and the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> does not cut the discount rate, historical probability indicates that the yield curve will invert,'' she said. Another cause for concern, in the view of <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Sorrentino </PERSON>, technical analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poor </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, is the fact that rates on three-month T-bills, at more than 7 percent, are higher than the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s discount rate, which it recently raised from 6 percent to 6.5 percent. `` Such a positive spread is a sign of a restrictive <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> policy, which usually places downward pressure on the stock market,'' <PERSON> Sorrentino </PERSON> said. `` Until the T-bill rate falls below the discount rate, this measure will remain in a bearish mode.'' Analysts at the financial advisory service <PERSON> Donoghue </PERSON>'s Moneyletter say managers of money market mutual funds have also been sounding a warning about interest rates and the financial outlook in recent months As a group, these managers have been shortening the average maturities of the securities in their portfolios. The standard motive for shortening maturities is to avoid or minimize price declines for existing securities when interest rates rise, and to have money available soon to invest at higher rates. `` When these managers believe interest rates are poised for a rise, they invest their funds in shorter-term securities,'' the newsletter said. `` Since the shortening began, the stock market generally has been moving sideways, and it recently has declined in the face of higher interest rates.''

 When he was just barely a teen-ager, <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON> decided he wanted to add a chapter to the book of retailing. By 1982, armed with an economics degree and experience as a Wall Street analyst and department store executive, he was ready to start writing. <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON>, then 31, opened his first Bookstop store in the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> capital, modeling it loosely on the successful Toys R Us design _ big selection and discount prices. A book `` superstore,'' he called it. Six years later, the Bookstop chain has grown to 17 stores _ with three more scheduled to open by year's end _ in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>. And the Bookstop founder and chairman says confidently that there will be more to the story. `` I decided when I was, like 13 years old, that someday I was going to start a chain of stores. Everything I've done since then was toward that goal,'' he said. But if your idea of a bookstore is a small, musty, dark-paneled place awash in pipe smoke, Bookstop stores might come as a shock. The company says its average store covers 9,500 square feet and stocks 35,000 titles in 300 subject areas. <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON> is an architecture buff, and the stores have moved into some unusual sites, including <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>'s art-deco <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> movie theater. The store being opened in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> will be located in a 100-year-old cotton warehouse. `` We've got the flexibility to do those things _ old cafeterias, old roller-skating rinks, old theaters,'' he said. `` I'd love to be in an old bank, too.'' Bookstops are open 12 hours a day or more, some closing only two days a year. They offer discounts of 10 percent on most titles, 25 percent on bestsellers and up to 40 percent for customers who annually purchase `` Readers Choice'' cards. The company counts more than 200,000 cardholders. Bookstop has centralized distribution, so books arriving at the <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> headquarters from publishers can be inventoried, labeled with the chain's own price tags and shipped to stores. The stores transmit their sales results nightly by computer, making them available the next morning so Bookstop's four buyers can see what's selling `` With a superstore like ours, to break even, our annual sales volume's got to be three, four times the sales of the average bookstore. It's a much harder thing to do, to carry that big a selection. We need an advanced computer system, real sophisticated inventory control systems, and yet we try to do it all at a discount,'' <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON> said, adding that <PERSON> Bookstop </PERSON> moved 4.5 million volumes through its distribution center last year. `` Retailing's always been an intensely competitive business. But it's becoming a much more technological business. Our survival depends much more on research, on understanding the customer, on computerized controls,'' he said. The privately held company does n't make public sales figures, although <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON> has said in the past that 1986 sales were $ 26 million. In 1985, the chain grew from six stores to 12 in 105 days. The company's founder got his start with an economics degree from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION>. He was a retailing analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and worked for department store companies in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. He says he spent seven years working on his Bookstop business plan before raising the money to open the first store. <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON> readily credits the Toys R Us stores with the concept. He voices a strong belief that discount specialty stores will be among retailing's big winners between now and the end of the century. He cites such companies as <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emporium </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, Sound Warehouse, and new superstores in office supplies and sporting goods. `` Books is one of the fastest-growing categories of retailing ... That demand ties to the baby boom, because baby boomers are getting richer every day, their incomes are rising as a group, and they're really oriented toward buying books, continuing self-education, and now buying their children books,'' <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON> said. Although other bookstore chains already were major national forces, <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON> said he did n't encounter too much skepticism when he approached investors with his idea of another. `` Books have survived the introduction of radio, the introduction of television, the introduction of phonograph records and movies. Books are a way of transmitting information, and compared with other ways of transmitting information, they are still cheap, portable, compact and readily available. We're trying to do our part to make them more readily available,'' he said.

 All business _ that's how <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Westcott </PERSON> came to be one of the latest success stories in the television industry. The 48-year-old <PERSON> Westcott </PERSON>, founder and chairman of Dallas-based <ORGANIZATION> Westcott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION>, has jumped to the forefront of the business television industry with his <ORGANIZATION> Automotive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Satellite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>. ASTN, billed as the world's largest private satellite television network, delivers about 30 hours of auto industry news and training programs to about 3,600 subscriber automobile dealerships across the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. The fledgling network has been a rapid success: some 18 percent of the nation's car dealerships pay about $ 385 a month to receive ASTN programming. <PERSON> Westcott </PERSON>'s goal is to have his programming aired to 50 percent of the industry. `` It does take people by surprise,'' <PERSON> Westcott </PERSON> said of his creation's success. `` They've been shocked.'' Industry experts say private television networks devoted to a particular business are a tremendous growth industry and the market could generate billions of dollars in business within 10 years, <PERSON> Westcott </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Westcott </PERSON> already is looking ahead. He just moved his company into a new $ 6 million headquarters with three studios and production facilities where more than 600 thirty-minute programs will be created and produced this year. <ORGANIZATION> Westcott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> plans soon to create private television programming for the banking, hotel and travel industries. <PERSON> Westcott </PERSON> said he also has contacted the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> with a proposal to create training programming for its employees. <PERSON> Westcott </PERSON> _ who owns auto dealerships in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> _ formed his private television network after buying an <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> affiliate in <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> and discovering at a network meeting in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> how inexpensive it was to buy satellite time. He decided that a private television network might be the perfect vehicle to provide top-quality training materials for the automobile dealerships he owned. He had found that existing films and other materials were not effectively training his employees. `` We did n't invent anything,'' <PERSON> Westcott </PERSON> said. `` But we just rolled it over into what it is now. We realize that people grow up watching 30 to 40 hours of television a week. And most people receive more information daily from television than any other source.'' The private network also allows businessmen to get important industry news as soon as possible, instead of having to wait for newsletters that might not arrive until 10 days or more after an important event. `` The news is what the dealer is most interested in,'' <PERSON> Westcott </PERSON> said. With a <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> news bureau and reporters in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> ASTN </ORGANIZATION> delivers news about plant closings, strikes, new financing rates and other items of interest to the automotive industry. Newscasts are made every 90 minutes. <PERSON> Westcott </PERSON> said many dealerships plan their sales meetings to include <ORGANIZATION> ASTN </ORGANIZATION> programming, and that an ASTN broadcast may be watched by as many as 20,000 people.

 To <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Levenson </PERSON>, the cafeteria is an all-American standby that occupies a perfect, sturdy niche in the often volatile restaurant industry. `` It's not a juicier hamburger, it's not a faster pizza. It's not a fad,'' said <PERSON> Levenson </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer of <PERSON> Furr </PERSON>'s - <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Cafeterias </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` And it's a reliable stream of The cash-rich, low-debt balance sheets of the cafeteria segment drew <PERSON> Levenson </PERSON> to acquire <PERSON> Furr </PERSON>'s - <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON>'s and has made Dallas-based <ORGANIZATION> Wyatt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cafeterias </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> his acquisition target for the past <PERSON> Levenson </PERSON> said Thursday he would not give his takeover attempts, but refused to specify his plans if his latest overture is rejected. The closely-held <PERSON> Wyatt </PERSON> has revenues of about $ 190 million and 120 restaurants nationwide. After first offering to buy the company in May 1986, <PERSON> Levenson </PERSON> made several bids for <PERSON> Wyatt </PERSON>. Last Wednesday, he sweetened his offer for <PERSON> Wyatt </PERSON> to $ 188.1 million in cash and securities from an earlier $ 179.3 million bid. The latest $ 91.25 per-share bid came after <PERSON> Wyatt </PERSON> rejected <PERSON> Levenson </PERSON>'s $ 87 per-share cash offer in favor of one from a <ORGANIZATION> Wyatt </ORGANIZATION> management-based employee stock ownership plan that bid $ 84 per share. <PERSON> Wyatt </PERSON> shareholders are scheduled to vote on the <ORGANIZATION> ESOP </ORGANIZATION> offer Sept. 6, and <PERSON> Wyatt </PERSON> management has not yet responded to the latest <PERSON> Furr </PERSON>'s - <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON>'s offer, `` If we do n't get the <PERSON> Wyatt </PERSON>'s deal that does n't mean we're out of the business of buying cafeterias,'' said <PERSON> Levenson </PERSON>, who owns a small stake in <LOCATION> Wyatt </LOCATION>. `` We're going to grow this company.'' The cafeteria business captured the 38-year-old <PERSON> Levenson </PERSON>'s attention after he bid unsuccessfully on companies such as Midland-based <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Aloha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Tesoro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> `` When I began studying the restaurant industry, the cafeteria segment of the restaurant industry stood out with some real unique features,'' he said. Convinced he had discovered a gold mine, in 1987 he acquired <PERSON> Furr </PERSON>'s Cafeterias and <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> <PERSON> Buffets </PERSON>, based in <LOCATION> Cedar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rapids </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, from <ORGANIZATION> K </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> mart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION> for $ 237.5 million. He converted <PERSON> Furr </PERSON>'s - <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON>'s into a limited partnership, got it listed on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> and sold 11 million partnership units at $ The partnership has promised to pay a cash distribution of $ 1.30 a share this year. <PERSON> Furr </PERSON>'s - Bishops is the nation's second largest operator of cafeterias in the nation, with 126 operating under the <PERSON> Furr </PERSON>'s name in 10 states and 26 under the Bishop's name in He never earned a college degree, but <PERSON> Levenson </PERSON> became the president of a family-owned bank in <LOCATION> Carlsbad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, before being lured away by the burgeoning oil and gas industry. `` Just being able to walk along and pick up the crumbs the Exxons of the world dropped and left would make you rich beyond your wildest dreams,'' he said. After buying and selling oil and gas leases during the late 1970s, his attention was drawn to the takeover attempts within the oil and gas industry by fellow <PERSON> West </PERSON> <PERSON> Texan </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boone </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Amarillo </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Levenson </PERSON> said his unsuccessful takeover runs at companies helped establish his credibility in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> financial community, enabling him to consummate the deal for <PERSON> Furr </PERSON>'s - For the second quarter this year, the cafeteria company posted revenue of $ 70.9 million, a more than 6 percent increase over the same quarter of 1987. <PERSON> Furr </PERSON>'s - <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON>'s had earnings of $ 2 million, or 12 cents per share, the partnership's first quarter in <PERSON> Levenson </PERSON> predicts the company's revenue will total $ 273 million this year and that will post a profit. He is confident he's in the right business, and cites the cafeteria business's lack of foriegn competition and relative isolation from costly high-tech development. `` Cafeteria companies have survived the Great Depression, they survived World War II, they survived the oil crunch and every boom and bust in the agriculture market,'' he said.
