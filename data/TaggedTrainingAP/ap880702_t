 Former <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Roark </PERSON> will be released from federal prison 18 days early because he has been a model prisoner while serving time for cocaine possession, authorities said Friday. <PERSON> Roark </PERSON>, who was sentenced to 179 days in prison in November after pleading guilty to cocaine possession, will be released July 20, said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Sizer </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION>. The former <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> mayor and <LOCATION> Kanawha </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> prosecutor will be credited with 16 days of time for good behavior and two days for time served after his arrest, <PERSON> Sizer </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Roark </PERSON>, who earned the nickname `` Mad Dog'' for his zealous prosecution of drug offenders during his days as <LOCATION> Kanawha </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> prosecutor, had just started his second four-year term when he was indicted. <PERSON> Roark </PERSON> was indicted in July 1987 on 27 cocaine-related counts and three charges of conspiracy to obstruct justice. All but six misdemeanor possession counts were dropped in a plea bargain in which he agreed to resign his office. A spokesman for the State Bar this week said <PERSON> Roark </PERSON> will be called in for a hearing soon after his release. The bar is deciding whether to revoke or suspend his license as a result of his guilty plea. <PERSON> Roark </PERSON> served as an assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney in western <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> in the mid-1970s before returning to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s largest city to begin his political career in 1978 He never lost an election and had been talked up as a future <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> candidate for governor or <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> before his legal problems started.

<TEXT>
 Postal workers cheered as the city council approved a law requiring vicious animals to wear fluorescent yellow collars and some owners to take out liability insurance on their pets. The law, passed Thursday in response to pit bull attacks, requires vicious animals to wear the collars, which signify the wearer has attacked humans or other animals or has been legally declared likely to do so without provocation. The ordinance also requires that an animal declared vicious be tattooed with the number that appears on the permit allowing the owner to keep it inside the city limits. In addition, owners of vicious animals can be forced to carry at least $ 100,000 in liability insurance to keep the pets in the city and can be fined up to $ 2,000 for violations of the new ordinance. Local letter carriers who gathered in council chambers cheered Thursday when the ordinance was passed. A <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION> postal worker was severely bitten by a pit bull in January, and an 83-year-old man died from wounds inflicted in a November attack by two pit bulls. `` I hope this action today will save lives in the future,'' Mayor <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Coggeshall </PERSON> said.

 Police searching a department store for a burglar arrested a man after the sound of his snoring led them to a store air duct where he was sleeping. `` We woke the young man up and took him to jail,'' police Lt. <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> <PERSON> Asper </PERSON> said Thursday. The search began Wednesday night when the <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ward </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s silent alarm was tripped. Officers looked through the store windows and saw a man wearing black, <PERSON> Asper </PERSON> said. Eight officers searched the roof and the store, a police helicopter circled overhead and two police dogs sniffed about, but the burglar could not be found, <PERSON> Asper </PERSON> said. By 5 a.m. Thursday, all but two officers were called off the search. Then, a noise that sounded like snoring drew Officer <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Holm </PERSON> to the air duct above the ceiling panels over the store's optometrist Near <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Torres </PERSON>' sleeping body, police found ropes, a knapsack, and about $ 3,800 worth of videotape recording equipment, <PERSON> Asper </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Torres </PERSON>, 18, was being held in <LOCATION> Riverside </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION> in lieu of $ 5,000 bail for investigation of burglary.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Friday signed a major expansion of Medicare to provide insurance against lingering major illnesses but warned future presidents and Congresses to keep the cost down lest it grow into `` a program we ca n't afford.'' `` Every administration since the <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> program was passed has worried about the seemingly uncontrollable cost increases in our government health care programs,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said at a ceremony in the White House Rose Garden. `` Whoever the president in office, program costs have exceeded the best congressional budget estimates,'' he said. `` Unless we are careful, it is possible that aspects of this legislation will do the same.'' The bill is the first substantial expansion of Medicare since it was established in 1965. Major portions of the new program will take effect in 1989, with some provisions phased in over subsequent years. <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> officials plan to mail a pamphlet to all beneficiaries explaining details of the changes. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> noted that the legislation provides new benefits for the nation's 32 million Medicare recipients, including prescription drugs and care provided to patients in their homes. `` We have no real way of knowinghow much these services will cost,'' he said. `` So if future administrations and Congresses are n't diligent, these new benefits could contribute to a program we ca n't afford. `` This could be more than a budget problem. It could be a tragedy. The program, after all, is to be paid for by the elderly themselves. So we must control the costs of these new benefits or we'll harm the very people we are trying to help.'' <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> enrollees will pay for the additional benefits through a flat increase in the premium deducted from monthly Social Security checks and an additional sliding scale premium on the approximately 40 percent of the elderly who pay federal income tax. The flat increase will be $ 4 a month in 1989, climbing to $ 10.20 in 1993. The sliding scale premium is projected to rise from a maximum of 15 percent of regular income tax liability in 1989 to about 28 percent in 1993. `` If administered with prudence, this program can povide countless Americans with peace of mind,'' the president said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has long been a foe of expanded federal welfare and other programs. However, he said the catastrophic-illness insurance is needed to `` help remove a terrible threat from the lives of elderly and disabled Americans, the threat of an illness requiring acute care, one so devastating that it could wipe out the savings of an entire lifetime.'' The new program provides full hospital coverage after a once-a-year deductible. The deductible is estimated at $ 564 in 1989 and is designed to rise with hospital inflation. <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> now pays full charges for no more than 59 days a year. The recipient is subject to a deductible for each hospitalization. <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> now pays 80 percent of approved doctor bills after a $ 75 deductible. This will continue to be the case for the first $ 1,370 a year, but above that the legislation provides that <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> will pay the approved bills in full. The recipient will still have to pay any amount over the fee approved by <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION>. The measure also provides a new benefit in which <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> will pay half of outpatient prescription drug costs in 1991 after a $ 600 deductible is met. The government share rises to 60 percent in 1992 and 80 percent in 1993. The deductible is also expected to increase each year to keep pace with rising drug costs. Medicare does not cover outpatient drugs now, except for a few very expensive ones such anti-rejection medication for organ transplant recipients. Another new benefit is so-called respite care, covering up to 80 hours a year for a nurse or home health aide to relieve a family caring for a patient at home. It will be available to those who exceed the limit on out-of-pocket expenses for doctors' care or the prescription drug deductible. Also for the first time, <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> will pay for breast cancer-detecting mammograms at specified frequencies, starting in 1990. The limit on such payments will be $ 50 per mammogram at first, but may be increased later if fees rise. The legislation is the product of a <ORGANIZATION> Senate-House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> committee </ORGANIZATION> that met from February until May to hammer out a compromise version of separate bills approved by the two chambers. The final measure passed the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, 238-72, on June 2 and sailed through the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, 86-11, on June 9.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Yegor </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>, the No. 2 man in the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>, provided an unprecedented look into the inner workings of the Soviet leadership with his description of the events that brought <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to power. <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> said Friday at the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> conference that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> had crucial support from himself, <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chebrikov </PERSON> when he became party general secretary in March 1985. <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON>, now president, was foreign minister at the time. <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>, recounting emotions and experiences in a manner rare for a member of the traditionally stoic party Politburo, disputed claims from ousted <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Communist Party boss <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> that he had slowed reform. He said he had been deeply worried about the fate of the country during the final days of <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>, who ruled from 1964 to 1982 in a `` time of stagnation.'' More `` very disquieting days and hours'' came when the party elite assembled to choose a successor to <PERSON> Konstantin </PERSON> <PERSON> U. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chernenko </PERSON> in March 1985, <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> said. `` Fate put me in the center'' of action, he said. `` We could have made quite different decisions. And, sometimes I think: What would have happened to the country after that?'' he told the conference delegates. With the support of <PERSON> Chebrikov </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON>, Politburo member <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Solomentsev </PERSON> and some regional party leaders, `` the only correct decision was taken,'' he added. <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON> made the nominating speech proposing <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> as general secretary after <PERSON> Chernenko </PERSON>'s death, but <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>'s account was the first to suggest Solomentsev had supported <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. His comments appeared to confirm rumors that circulated at the time that former <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party boss <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grishin </PERSON>, an ally of <PERSON> Chernenko </PERSON> and <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>, had made a last-minute attempt to secure the leadership. <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>'s statements, which were televised, also could boost <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON> and <PERSON> Solomentsev </PERSON> a day after they were criticized by name at the four-day conference, which ended Friday. <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON>, 78, was foreign minister for 28 years before accepting the largely ceremonial presidency in July 1985. He and <PERSON> Solomentsev </PERSON> have sat on the policy-setting <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> since the early 1960s. `` The country came to a crisis'' before <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> became leader, <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> said. He spoke of corruption, lack of discipline and alcoholism. Because of a lack of frankness, even `` the party was in danger,'' he said. `` All revolutionary parties that died did so because they were afraid to talk about their weaknesses,'' he said. <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> spoke of his career during the <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> years. `` In the years of stagnation I worked and lived in <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader in the Siberian city of <LOCATION> Tomsk </LOCATION> from 1965-83. `` I say with pride that I built socialism. And there were millions of such people.'' Referring with a touch of humor to the Russian practice of sending misfits and disidents to <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> said, `` Perhaps we worked like that because we knew that they would n't send us farther than <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>.''

 The commander of Soviet troops in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> said they served with honor and were not defeated, but two influential officials criticized the decision to intervene in the fight against U.S.-backed rebels. `` We came to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> not to win battles, but to defend women and children, villages and cities. And we have performed our duty with honor,'' Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Gromov </PERSON> told the national <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> conference on Friday. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> entered in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979, and more than 100,000 troops were helping the Marxist government fight the Moslem guerrillas until a withdrawal agreement was signed in April. <PERSON> Gromov </PERSON>, who told reporters this week that the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> is no longer taking active part in the fighting, rejected claims that the Soviet force was beaten. <PERSON> Grigory </PERSON> <PERSON> Baklanov </PERSON>, editor of the literary journal <LOCATION> Znamya </LOCATION>, said the decision to intervene was made `` in defiance of the machinery of democracy.'' He said some non-voting members of the ruling Politburo learned about the decision only by reading the newspapers. `` I receive many letters from mothers,'' he said in remarks broadcast by Soviet television. `` They ask, ` How did this happen? Who supported it?''' <PERSON> Yevgeny </PERSON> <PERSON> Primakov </PERSON> said the decision under late President <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> was made `` without a proper examination of the possible alternatives of a political resolution.'' The remarks by <PERSON> Primakov </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION> and International Relations of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>, were provided by the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency. The discussion of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> on the fourth and final day of the conference lacked the sharp character of debates on the bolder news media, the economy and other issues. But coupled with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s own critique and some personal criticism during the conference of President <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON> _ the foreign minister for 28 years _ it indicated serious dissatisfaction with the conduct of foreign policy earlier this decade. Soviet military officials have refused to criticize the orders to fight in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, which cost them more than 13,000 dead and 35,000 wounded. According to the terms of an April 14 agreement signed in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, a fifth of the 100,000 Soviet soldiers have left <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and the remainder must be gone by Feb. 15, 1989. In his opening address to the party conference Tuesday, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> praised the soldiers who served in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, but the criticism of <PERSON> Baklanov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Primakov </PERSON> echoed other remarks of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. `` It sometimes happened that even decisions of vital importance were taken by a narrow circle of people without collective, comprehensive examination of analysis, on occasion without properly consulting friends either. This led to an inadequate reaction to international events and to the policies of other states, if not to mistaken decisions,'' he said. The <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreement and withdrawal from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> `` have become an international milestone in the political settlement of regional conflicts, which are fraught with a danger to the world as a whole and which hinder the progress of the nations,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. He said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> too often in the past has emphasized military strength rather than political skill. He has been extremely critical of the rule of <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> as a period of stagnation and corruption. In an address Thursday, a local party official called for a pair of officials long influential in foreign affairs to step down because they had been part of <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>'s administration. Prompted by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to name names, <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Melnikov </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Siberian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Komi </LOCATION> region called for <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON> and <PERSON> Georgy </PERSON> <PERSON> Arbatov </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.A.-Canada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> for the past 21 years, to step down. Other Soviet officials in recent months have suggested that the decision to send soldiers into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> was a mistake, but their comments were in less - influential and less-public forums

 The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> conference in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> generally brought praise from <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, where the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>'s new policies are pressuring leaders to reform their own countries `` In <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, in our party, we are deeply satisfied with the course of the <ORGANIZATION> CPSU </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- conference,'' said a commentary of the official Polish news agency <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION>. `` With satisfaction we receive the changes brought by perestroika and new thinking.'' <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> have gone the farthest in matching or even exceeding Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms in the economy and politics. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, who closed the four-day conference Friday, will be paying a six-day visit to <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> beginning July 11. The `` new thinking'' at the conference `` creates fresh possibilities of a gradual demilitarization and humanization of international relations,'' Polish <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Stefan </PERSON> <PERSON> Staniszewski </PERSON> told a news conference Thursday. In <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, where officials privately say they are waiting to see whether <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will strengthen his position at the conference, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily Rude Pravo said the event `` will be an inspiration and a source of practical enlightment for us.'' If the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader gets a mandate for more radical reforms, it would increase pressure on <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s leaders _ installed after <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> crushed Gorbachev-like reforms with tanks 20 years ago _ to adopt political change and to reform economic structure more quickly. `` The ideas ... are worth thinking about,'' Rude Pravo said. In <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, which broke with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> over ideological issues 40 years ago, the state press carried lengthy reports from the conference describing it as `` historic, dramatic and exceptionally open.'' Yugoslav media pointed to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s words that there will be no prosperity for socialism without fundamental and deep democratization of the Soviet society. All the Communist leaderships in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, many of them now more secretive and orthodox than the modern <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION>, have followed the conference debate over the Stalinist past and the need to open up <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> life. One exception was <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, whose leader <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> has so far rejected any need to reform his rigid economic and political system. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> Scinteia </ORGANIZATION> carried a four-paragraph report about the conference opening without any comment and did not publish any excerpts from <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s speech.

 Negotiations are the only road to peace in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> told Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, who reportedly is considering a new aid program for the rebels. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> said he told <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> on Friday that negotiating between <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist Sandinista government and the rebels, known as Contras, was still possible despite a breakdown in talks last month. `` I am sure that the offer of the Sandinista government is not their final offer,'' <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> told reporters at his home moments after <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s departure for <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> spent six hours in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, the last stop on a three-day, four-nation Central American trip. In <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> met with Contra leaders. He was said to have discussed a $ 30 million aid package for the rebels that could also hold out the promise of economic aid to the Sandinistas. <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON>, a member of the Contra directorate, said he and his colleagues talked with <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> about a package that might include the promise of financial help to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> if the Sandinistas bring about promised democratic reforms. Even a qualified offer of aid to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> would represent a sharp turnaround in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration cut off all direct aid to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> seven years ago and has applied an economic embargo for the past four years. <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON>, another Contra leader, said $ 7 million of the aid to the rebels might be earmarked for military hardware, but would be held in escrow and released only if the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> failed to negotiate in good faith during peace talks. <PERSON> Calero </PERSON>, however, described the talks with <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> as only informal consultations, and the secretary himself declined to discuss them. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has said only that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will be asked to approve an unspecified amount of new assistance to the rebels. At a news conference between two formal meetings with <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said the administration is `` seeking obviously to support those who stand up and are ready to struggle'' against the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>. But, as he did throughout his trip, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> devoted most of his comments to comparing <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> unfavorably with the rest of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Only <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, he said, has suffered economic and social decline in the past decade. The Contras have received no military aid since Feb. 29. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> approved a $ 17 million humanitarian aid package in late March after the rebels and the Sandinista government agreed on a 60-day cease-fire. <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s president, <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, unilaterally extended the cease-fire earlier this week until July 31, and <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> said that gave new hope to the negotiating process, which he has been championing for more than a year. The on-again, off-again talks have been held under the aegis of an Arias-sponsored peace plan signed by all five <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> presidents last Aug. 7. The plan won <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> the 1987 Nobel Peace Prize. The five presidents plan to meet again in August to assess progress of the peace plan. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> said <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> suggested meeting personally with the foreign ministers of <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> shortly before that summit. `` Now that the truce has been extended 30 days more, I'm sure that we should take advantage of that extension and keep on with the dialoque,'' <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> said. `` I'm sure we can reach a cease-fire soon, and also to advance to real democracy in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> really soon. `` There is no better way to resolve the crisis than through negotiations, dialoque,'' <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> said, adding that he had conveyed the same message to <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> also said he agreed with <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>' proposal that the secretary of state meet with the four foreign ministers before the summit, tentatively set for Aug. 7 in either <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> would be excluded from the preliminary meeting, but not from the summit itself.

 State-run television interrupted its usual bland fare for spicy, live interviews after a disgraced leader pleaded for forgiveness in a dramatic speech at a national <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> conference. One delegate told a television correspondent that the conference discussion about ousted <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party chief <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> was a healthy sign that democracy and `` glasnost,'' leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of openness, was taking hold. `` We can speak our minds openly and directly, without being afraid of anything,'' said <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Maximov </PERSON>, a balding metalworker from the Siberian town of <LOCATION> Biisk </LOCATION>. During a Friday afternoon break in the final session of the first party conference in 47 years, Soviet television broadcast the live interviews in the lobby of the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>'s Palace of Congresses with some of the 5,000 delegates. Most of the discussion during the broadcast focused on what one delegate called the highlight of Friday's session of the four-day conference, the speech by <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, a former <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> protege. `` It's the most heated discussion we have heard in a long time,'' a gray-haired delegate told the television correspondent. A studio anchorman began the 30-minute broadcast and then switched live to the correspondent on the scene. Delegates had just ended floor debate about <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>'s speech, in which he asked to be cleared of blame for criticizing other Soviet leaders and saying reform was proceeding too slowly. The discussion spilled over into the television interviews. Some delegates told viewers they supported <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, while others condemned his remarks as `` politically incorrect.'' <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> was fired as <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party boss and removed from his post as a non-voting member of the ruling Politburo after a bitter speech to the party's <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> last October, in which he complained that economic reforms had stalled and asked to be relieved of his duties. His speech at that meeting has never been published. <PERSON> Maximov </PERSON>, the delegate from <LOCATION> Biisk </LOCATION>, said it is difficult for people to make up their minds about whether <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>'s criticism was justified because his <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> speech remains secret. `` Glasnost must be deep; then such questions would n't arise,'' he told the television interviewer. During the conference, Soviet television and radio provided periodic newsbriefs with highlights of speeches and live interviews with delegates. The popular evening news program `` Vremya,'' which reportedly has a nightly audience of tens of millions of Soviets, departed from its usual fare of dull reports about the latest beet harvest or other economic achievement to carry extensive coverage on the party conference. The nightly program normally runs 45 minutes but Friday it continued for three hours with extensive clips of <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>'s address and remarks by his critics. Videotape showed <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> appealing for political rehabilitation, and when there was a roar from the delegates <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> waved his hands and asked that <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> be allowed to continue. `` Vremya'' directors apparently felt the <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> issue was so important that they continued showing the taped reports even after <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> began his speech closing the conference. Soviet radio carried <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s speech live and Vremya later broadcast a recording.

 Teen pop star <PERSON> Tiffany </PERSON>, about to embark on her first world tour, says that unlike many sudden success stories, her career has not gone to her head. `` I'm real cautious about staying a regular teen-ager,'' said <PERSON> Tiffany </PERSON>, 16, who is scheduled to perform here Saturday night at the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Amphitheatre </LOCATION>. With 5 million copies of her first album sold and a second album on the way, it's easy to see how a young singer could get heady. `` I've had other friends who hit it big with a record or something, and they changed completely. I do n't want that to happen to me,'' she said recently. <PERSON> Tiffany </PERSON>, who recently petitioned a court to have herself legally recognized as an adult, withdrew the petition in an out-of-court settlement with her mother. However, a legal battle between her mother and manager is still being waged over who will control the teen's growing fortune.

 People who received unsolicited pornography sparked an investigation that authorities said resulted in federal charges against companies responsible for much of the country's sexually oriented mailings Indictments unsealed Friday in eight states charged 20 people and 14 companies under a section of federal law that makes it a crime to use the mails for advertising or distributing obscene material. `` Project Postporn,'' the official moniker for the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department-Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> probe, specifically targeted hard-core pornography, which depicts actual sexual acts. Mailings usually arrived at homes addressed to adults, children or simply `` resident,'' said <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney for <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and chairman of the attorney general's subcommittee on obscenity. `` They arrive unsolicited in innocuous-looking envelopes in the homes of unsuspecting people who have never subscribed to pornography, do not want it in their homes and are never going to order any obscene material,'' <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said at a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> news conference Friday. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Swagerty </PERSON>, assistant chief postal inspector, said such mailings had increased in recent years, prompting more than 350,000 people to file postal service forms requesting that they not receive sexually oriented material though the mail. About 100,000 of them were filed in the last year, he said. The investigation began a year ago in response to complaints, officials said. <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said it had targeted only `` hard-core obscenity which the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has held is not protected by the First Amendment.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s test of obscenity is that the material, taken as a whole, has to appeal to prurient interest; portray sexual conduct in a patently offensive way in light of contemporary community standards; and lack serious artistic, political or scientific value. A 1986 report by Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s pornography commission linked hard-core pornography to sex crimes. <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> restated that view Friday when asked by reporters whether the material had actually caused any harm. `` I think it's an accepted fact that the depiction of explicit sex acts ... has the effect of conditioning individuals to committing those acts and conditioning society so that that is accepted as the norm,'' he said. But <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON>, legislative counsel for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, denounced that view as `` hysteria'' and said it conflicted with the First Amendment guaranteeing the right of free speech. `` There is n't any evidence that links adults looking at pornography to any real crime,'' he said in an interview later. `` It may be grotesque, but much of the stuff is just obviously consenting adults having sex.'' <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said the targeted material depicts sexual acts, `` often in a context of violence toward women and children, and often stressing themes such as rape, incest, torture, bondage, child sexual abuse and bestiality.'' The officials displayed at the news conference samples of the advertisements, which included one promoting nine `` full-length movies'' for $ 79 featuring `` 12 hours of the rawest sex ever filmed.'' Another advertised `` new bondage videos,'' including `` Captive Co-Eds'' and `` Harem Girls in Bondage.'' Undercover agents responding to complaints about the material purchased samples and compiled evidence to search 11 companies, and then developed evidence on others, officials said. <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said the companies represent `` as much as three-fourths of mailings of sexually oriented material in this country.'' The companies charged operated under a variety of names and had a number of other associated companies. Indictments or criminal complaints were returned in <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Harrisburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>; and <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash </LOCATION>. The criminal charges were filed in the city where the obscene material was received, not necessarily where the distributors operated.

 Soviet missile specialists arrived in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> on Friday to verify compliance with a treaty to eliminate superpower medium-range missiles as a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> inspection team made its way to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Vyacheslav </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lebedev </PERSON>, the Soviet team chief, said through an interpreter that his inspectors will `` follow the letter and spirit'' of a treaty they hope will further world peace. The 70 Soviet inspectors arrived at <ORGANIZATION> Travis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, located about 50 miles west of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, on an IL-62 Aeroflot flown by a 10-member Soviet crew. The Soviet government notified the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> early Friday that five teams were landing in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Kendall </PERSON> <PERSON> Pease </PERSON>, spokesman for the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. On-Site Inspection Agency, created last January to monitor compliance with the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty. Under the treaty, signed last Dec. 9 at the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> summit, the Soviets need not list the sites they want to visit until they have been in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> 48 hours, <PERSON> Pease </PERSON> said. Other Soviet teams will inspect sites in the eastern <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, but their arrival time has not been relayed to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Pease </PERSON> said. The teams have 60 days to carry out the `` baseline inspections,'' designed to verify the exact number of missiles and related components to be destroyed under treaty. In <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> inspection teams, consisting of 10 experts each, met with reporters before boarding an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> jet for the flight to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. `` We all feel this is a historic mission,'' the head of the inspection agency, <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brig </ORGANIZATION>. Gen. <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Lajoie </PERSON>, told reporters One <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> team was headed from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to the Soviet city of <LOCATION> Votkinsk </LOCATION>, the site of a plant that formerly built the SS-20 missiles, the most important Soviet weapon to be eliminated under the treaty. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has the right to keep a team at <LOCATION> Votkinsk </LOCATION> for up to 13 years, and the Soviets may station inspectors for the same period at <ORGANIZATION> Magna </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, site of Hercules Plant No. 1, where <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> missiles were produced. Inspection teams will verify destruction of 1,800 missiles and check on about 3,200 related components, including storage and transport missile containers and special hauling vehicles, <PERSON> Lajoie </PERSON> told reporters. `` We're going in with the attitude, ` Trust everybody, but always cut the cards,''' <PERSON> Lajoie </PERSON> said. Over the next 60 days, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> team will inspect 126 sites in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, including 33 in eastern <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>, he said. Soviet teams will inspect 26 sites in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, including 11 in the continental <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said. The treaty allows the two sides to visit the other's country on 16 hours' notice, then permits them to wait 48 hours before giving notification of the exact sites to be visited. Reporters were not to be allowed to accompany the teams. The pact, the first to allow such on-site inspection, is viewed as a trial for the proposed <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reduction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION>, which would slash arsenals of long-range superpower nuclear weapons by 30 percent to 50 percent, and involve much more complicated verification procedures.

 Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> says the government will likely extend `` a helping hand'' to drought-stricken farmers as soon as there's a solid assessment of crop damage. But <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> said despite stark evidence of the havoc wreaked by the dry spell, `` I think it would be premature to start putting dollars up there.'' After briefing President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on the findings of an interagency task force on the drought, the secretary told reporters Friday that long-range weather forecasts are discouraging. `` We did have some showers in the last few days that helped in some places and the weather's cooler, so those are good signs,'' he said, `` but the weather forecasts indicate that it -LRB- the drought -RRB- has not broken and is continuing and is still very, very serious.'' Meanwhile, it was disclosed by a senior administration official that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will fly to <LOCATION> Davenport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, July 14 to view drought damage. <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON>, who heads a drought-relief task force <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> set up last month, said that `` sooner or later I suspect that the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the administration will see that we need to help with money if the thing continues as bad as it's been. Just how you do that is very complex.'' <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> would not speculate on whether aid money might be available from the roughly $ 17 billion in the commodity price support payments the administration requested for the new budget year starting Oct. 1. There had been indications that because of the drought, not all of the $ 17 billion would be needed for subsidies and that the excess money might be used for aid purposes. `` To get into writing checks to farmers for relief to help tide them over almost needs to await the normal harvest period so that they can compare what they are harvesting, what happened to them,'' he said. `` At that time, we should be standing there with a helping hand.'' It was the fourth briefing that <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> has given <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who established the task force in mid-June to recommend steps the government can take.

<HEAD>Emergency Board Proposes Compromise To Avert Strike</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID FOX</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A presidential panel trying to resolve a dispute between the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and one of its unions is offering a compromise that would preserve some jobs and prevent a threatened strike. The White House released a 29-page report late Friday in which an emergency board said both sides should make sacrifices. The report also recommended arbitration if the nation's eighth-largest railroad and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> can not agree on specific personnel cuts At issue is a <ORGANIZATION> CNW </ORGANIZATION> proposal to eliminate the jobs of 1,050 <ORGANIZATION> UTU </ORGANIZATION> brakemen by cutting the size of its train crews from four to two workers _ an engineer and conductor _ in most cases. Spokeswoman <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Cleveland </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Northwestern could save about $ 51 million a year by reducing manpower, calling it a necessary step to remain competitive. However, the union characterized the cuts affecting half its <ORGANIZATION> CNW </ORGANIZATION> members as a contract violation and demanded no change from the status quo. It threatened to strike on April 22, prompting President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to appoint the emergency board under the Railway Labor Act. `` The carrier, unlike many of the other railroads in the industry, has an economic need for relief from its present crew-consist rules. ...,'' the board said. `` This is not to say that the employees, alone, should be expected to bear the burden.'' Although the board said <ORGANIZATION> CNW </ORGANIZATION> should be allowed to eliminate one brakemen per train, it recommended that further reductions be decided by an arbitration board case-by-case. The panel also said <ORGANIZATION> CNW </ORGANIZATION> should be able to terminate some workers if not enough accept voluntary separation allowances. But it also recommended raising the railroad's proposed $ 25,000 allowance to $ 50,000 for employees leaving voluntarily and $ 45,000 for those forced into separation. Company officials said they had not seen the report and had no immediate comment Friday. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Markgraf </PERSON>, the union's general chairman, said: `` These things work out in strange ways sometimes. We're still hoping for a settlement.'' A strike can not begin before 12:01 a.m. Aug. 4, said <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>, an administrative assistant to the emergency board. <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Northwestern ranks eighth among <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> railroads in revenue and handled nearly 1.5 million carloads of traffic in 1986. It also provides the principal daily rail service for about 40,000 commuters in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> area.

<TEXT>
 Speculation over vice presidential candidates continues to be the hottest topic for both parties, with little political fireworks in store for the start of the holiday weekend. Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, their parties' presidential nominations sewn up, are n't tipping their hands over running mates. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, campaigning Friday with Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, said he would `` make a decision when I'm ready to make a decision.'' <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, considered a leading choice for a spot on the Democratic ticket, received an enthusiastic welcome from a home-state crowd at an Auto Workers union hall in <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION>. `` I've been taking a poll all over <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> about running mates,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` What do you think about <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>?'' The crowded cheered and whistled. `` Sounds unanimous to me,'' said the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, meanwhile, was spending a quiet few days at a vacation home in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, before heading back to the campaign trail for a Fourth of July swing through <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>. What little activity there was on the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> side was provided by Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, who fenced with reporters in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> over his vice presidential chances. `` I'd be happy to discuss it'' with the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. `` If someone makes that call ... you talk about it very seriously.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> met with reporters following a private breakfast in <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> with Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, another possible <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> running mate. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, asked if they discussed the vice presidential nomination, said: `` We indicated there probably would be one. We did n't go into details. I indicated he'd be a good one, and he indicated the same, that I'd be a good one.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is back in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> today, with plans to cap the holiday weekend by hosting <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> at a Fourth of July dinner. With two weeks until the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is playing it close to the vest on a running mate. He said he expects to notify those he does n't choose before making any public announcement. `` I generally have the practice of notifying people I do n't pick,'' he said but declined to say whether <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> might get the word at dinner on Monday `` We're going to have dinner and listen to some good music,'' he said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> invited <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON>, to join him and his wife, <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON>, for a holiday dinner at their home in <LOCATION> Brookline </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, and then attend a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> Pops concert. In another development with possible political ramifications, sources said appraisals of land in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Braintree </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, where state officials want to build a 500-bed prison list the property's value at between $ 5 million and $ 6 million That is well below the $ 9.5 million developers sought when the state became interested in the land two years ago. The appraisals are being reviewed by a third company, which is scheduled to submit its estimate of the property's worth next week. All three will be used by the state to determine how much to offer for the 782 acres bought by two developers in December 1985 for $ 3 million. The selection of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Braintree </LOCATION> site in 1986 by <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for a 500-bed medium security prison has been controversial from the outset, with local residents claiming a prison would ruin the tiny central <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> community. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> is conducting a preliminary inquiry into allegations that the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> administration leaked word of its interest in the land to the developers, who bought it from a church. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> has said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is not under investigation.

<HEAD>Martin-Marietta Says It Bought Club</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Defense contractor <ORGANIZATION> Martin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marietta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> says it bought a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> health club once owned in part by a congressman who chairs a military appropriations subcommittee because the purchase `` appears to have been a good investment.'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Marietta </PERSON> disclosed Friday it bought the club in <LOCATION> Ocala </LOCATION> little more than a year after a company executive and other partners reportedly rescued Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Chappell </PERSON> from foreclosure on the property. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Marietta </PERSON> issued a statement saying that a company subsidiary bought Fun and <ORGANIZATION> Fitness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ocala </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, on May 30, 1986, for $ 200,000 `` from a group of five private investors who had purchased the property for $ 175,000'' in a bank foreclosure process. The company said the corporation was aware at the time that <PERSON> Chappell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., `` had held a prior interest in the racquet club. One of the five private investors had been <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dalferes </PERSON>, vice president of government affairs at <ORGANIZATION> Martin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marietta </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, just outside <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Marietta </PERSON> said its purchase `` appears to have been a good investment because the property has a market value in excess of the purchase price.'' <PERSON> Chappell </PERSON> said Friday he had kept an `` arm's length'' away from the transaction in which the investors, all representatives of defense contractors, reportedly intervened for him. <PERSON> Chappell </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Appropriations defense subcommittee, refused to discuss details of the complex transaction, reported Friday by <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. But in a statement issued by his office, he said: `` If you are going to do something wrong, you do n't do it on the public record. This entire transaction is a matter of public record. It has been since its inception several years ago.'' <PERSON> Chappell </PERSON> has said he is not a target in the ongoing criminal investigation of <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> weapons-buying. That investigation involves allegations that defense contractors and consultants, many of them former military men, bribed <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials for contracting details that could be vital in winning contracts worth billions of dollars. The <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported that the <ORGANIZATION> Racquet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ocala </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> intervened in late 1984 to cancel <PERSON> Chappell </PERSON>'s and his partner's personal liability for a large part of their indebtedness and also removed the two men as defendants in a suit related to the health club's foreclosure The principal officers of <ORGANIZATION> Racquet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Ocala </LOCATION> were <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Killgore </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dalferes </PERSON>. <PERSON> Killgore </PERSON>, a former <PERSON> Chappell </PERSON> aide, was then an official with the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> office of <ORGANIZATION> Avco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a rocket builder, the newspaper said. A <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> court had ruled in November 1984 that <PERSON> Chappell </PERSON> and his partner, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON>, personally had guaranteed some $ 172,000 of the overall obligation in the failed club, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said. The December 1984 settlement resulted in <PERSON> Killgore </PERSON> and his investment partners obtaining the health club and its properties for $ 175,000, <PERSON> Chappell </PERSON>'s statement noted. <PERSON> Chappell </PERSON>'s statement said: `` This property was appraised by the bank at $ 425,000. According to public record, the purchaser sold the property for at least a $ 20,000 profit 13 months later.'' `` There was absolutely no benefit to me either way,'' he said. `` The transaction changed no legal responsibilities with reference to <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Chappell </PERSON>, no consideration of any sort passed to <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Chappell </PERSON>. It was an arm's length transaction, as supported by public record.''

 Tamil militants in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> are ready to surrender, but negotiations have stalled because the rebels are demanding $ 38.4 million from the Indian government, Tamil sources said. Sources close to the rebels in <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Friday the militants were not willing to allow monitoring of how the money was spent. In the southern Indian city of <LOCATION> Madras </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Sadasivam </PERSON> <PERSON> Krishnakumar </PERSON>, a senior member of the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eelam </ORGANIZATION>, was quoted as saying the group was willing to surrender but awaited final orders from its commander. The <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION>, the largest rebel group in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>, have been at the forefront of the five-year guerrilla war with the ethnic Sinhalese-dominated government for an independent Tamil homeland. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, which has 50,000 peacekeeping troops in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>, has been trying to negotiate an end to the separatist war in the neighboring island nation. The Sri Lankan government on Thursday offered amnesty to the rebels and promised to conduct provincial elections by the end of July in northern and eastern <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>, where the rebels want a separate homeland. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Krishnakumar </PERSON> as telling reporters in <LOCATION> Madras </LOCATION> that the <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> would participate in the provincial elections. But he said no decision had been made on whether the <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION>' organization would participate in the elections itself or would form a new political party, the news agency It quoted <PERSON> Krishnakumar </PERSON> as saying the <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> would hand over their weapons as soon as an agreement was reached on the timing of a surrender and the number of arms to be given up. He also said a final decision would be taken only after consultations with the <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION>' commander, <PERSON> Velupillai </PERSON> <PERSON> Prabhakaran </PERSON>. <PERSON> Prabhakaran </PERSON> is based in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> and has successfully eluded a series of manhunts by Indian troops. Last July 29, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> signed a peace accord aimed at ending the ethnic warfare in the island nation off <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s southern coast. The <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> accepted the accord but reneged in October. The accord was accompanied by a payment of $ 384,600 by the Indian government to the rebels for rehabilitation of people affected by the fighting. Since October, more than 400 Indian soldiers have been killed in ambushes and battles with the Tamil rebels, according to the Indian government. Neither the Indians nor the Tamils have estimated the number of rebel deaths. In the latest reported violence, seven Indian soldiers were killed in two ambushes Thursday, said Sri Lankan military officials who spoke on condition of anonymity. They said four were killed near <LOCATION> Trincomalee </LOCATION>, 150 miles north of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>; and three were killed near <LOCATION> Vavuniya </LOCATION>, 110 miles north of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>. Two Tamils were killed in <LOCATION> Vavuniya </LOCATION> during search operations launched Friday by the Indians, the officials said. The Tamil insurgency grew out of the belief the community was being discriminated against by the Sinhalese ethnic majority, which controls the country's government and armed forces. Tamils comprise 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people and the Sinhalese form 75 percent. Most Tamils are Hindus, like the majority of Indians, while most Sinhalese are Buddhists. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> became involved in the Sri Lankan ethnic strife because of the sympathies of its own 60 million Tamils to the rebel cause.

<BYLINE>Brazil Steeps its New Constitution in Controversy
^By JORGE MEDEROS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 National lawmakers are preparing for final voting on the draft of a new constitution that would reject sweeping land reform but liberalize work rules and end foreign control of mining. The new charter for <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s largest country would also give President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> and his successors a five-year term, a victory for the national leader. The proposed document was born in five months of heated debate in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, doubling as a Constitutional Convention. It has come up 235 articles that will be the basis for the eighth constitution in the 166 years of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s independence from <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>. The final round of voting is expected to start near the end of July. But the document appears largely to have assumed its final form because a hefty 280 votes in the 559-member convention would be needed to change it. The convention, made up of representatives and senators picked in free elections in 1986, began rewriting the current constitution, dictated during a 1964-1985 military regime, in February 1987. The project started with a computer-generated document touching nearly every aspect of life imaginable in this country of about 140 million people. It then progressed to a first draft of more than 3,000 articles, which critics derided as an `` encyclopedia.'' The real paring began last February with article-by-article voting, in which a majority of 280 was needed for approval. Lawmakers debated vociferously, sometimes violently, especially about issues like land reform, workers' rights and the role of foreign capital. Other hotly contested matters involved how long <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON>, the civilian who assumed office in 1985, should stay there; and whether <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> should have a U.S.-type presidential form of government or a European-style prime minister system. As it stands, the proposed constitution contains these provisions: _ <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> and future presidents will serve for five years, compared to the six years of former military presidents. The presidential system remains in place. _ Wide-ranging land reform, in a country where 4 percent of the people own 50 percent of the farmable land, was rejected. _ Workers appear headed for a shorter work week and more liberal vacation benefits. But a liberal maternity leave program might not survive the final vote because businesses view it as too expensive. _ Foreign companies involved in mining will have to leave <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> in four years or transfer financial control to residents of the country. _ Risk contracts allowing foreign companies to drill for oil probably wo n't be continued. _ The return of legalized casino gambling was rejected. The biggest fight broke out between <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> and convention members over the length of the presidential term. <PERSON> Tancredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Neves </PERSON>, a moderate who said he wanted only four years as president before holding elections, died before taking office in 1985. <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s last presidential election was in 1960. <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON>, vice president-elect and former chief of the military regime's official party, moved into the presidency. He made it clear he believed he had inherited the six-year term of his military predecessor, Gen. <PERSON> Joao </PERSON> <PERSON> Figueiredo </PERSON>, but said he would consider stepping down after five years. However, many congressmen wanted <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> out after four years, with presidential elections in November 1988. <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> won his five years in the constitutional debating, but at the cost of splitting his <ORGANIZATION> Brazilian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> party. Various groups are still seeking changes in the final form of the document. A conservative block, known as the `` Big Center,'' is trying to gain support to strike the anti-foreign articles involving mining and oil prospecting and a proposition allowing civil servants strike under certain circumstances. Leftists, including members of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s two small Communist parties, want to try to knock out conservative provisions on land reform and one that lets civilian powers call in the armed forces to deal with internal problems. There is no time limit for the last round of debate.

 Five firemen killed when a burning roof collapsed onto them were like `` family'' in this city, which had never had a firefighter die in the line of duty. `` There are only 100 of us in this department and this is just a small place,'' Fire Chief <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Aiellos </PERSON> said Friday. `` In a town like this these are your friends.'' `` It's a sad day in <LOCATION> Hackensack </LOCATION>,'' added Mayor <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Cerbo </PERSON>. `` We've never had anything like this in our city before. To have five firemen die is just incredible.'' The fire, which destroyed the building and contents of a car dealership, started shortly after 3 p.m. Friday in the rear service section of the building, <PERSON> Aiellos </PERSON> said. The ceiling collapsed as the firefighters, who were inside the building, were cutting a hole in it to get a hose on flames in a space between the ceiling and the roof, <PERSON> Aiellos </PERSON> said. The five were killed almost instantly. `` All of a sudden the entire 60 foot square inside ceiling fell on them,'' he said, adding that four other firefighters inside at the time escaped injury. The fire apparently started in the space between the ceiling and roof above the dealership's service area, <PERSON> Aiellos </PERSON> said. The men were spraying the space to try to create a `` fog'' to decrease the fire's heat, he said. `` They did what they were supposed to do,'' <PERSON> Aiellos </PERSON> said. All of <LOCATION> Hackensack </LOCATION>'s 100 firefighters as well as units from surrounding towns responded to the blaze, which was under control by 6:30 p.m. Later, fire investigators picked through the debris. But the roof collapse may make it impossible to find the exact cause, <PERSON> Aiellos </PERSON> said. A damage estimate was not immediately available. Hundreds of bystanders watched along the busy intersection in this <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> suburb of 40,000 people while the firefighters' bodies were placed in ambulances Many clutched friends when stretchers bearing the bodies came briefly into view. The victims were Capt. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, 54, Lt. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Reinhogen </PERSON>, 48, and firefighters <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Krejsa </PERSON>, 52, <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Radumski </PERSON> 38, and <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ennis </PERSON>, 30. All five were from <LOCATION> Hackensack </LOCATION>. All the employees of <ORGANIZATION> Hackensack </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> were evacuated without injuries, police said. There were no other firefighters injured. <PERSON> Cerbo </PERSON> said a memorial service would be held next week. Aiellos planned to meet with the families today after autopsies are performed. `` These were good men,'' he said. `` And there are a lot of kids.'' The fatalities were the first deaths in action in <LOCATION> Hackensack </LOCATION> Fire Department history, <PERSON> Aiellos </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Hackensack </LOCATION>, only four square miles in size, has many longtime residents who will be hit hard by the deaths, he said. At the department's headquarters, a wreath and an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flag at half - staff paid tribute to the victims `` It was like losing a member of your family,'' firefighter <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Canzanella </PERSON> said.

 Defense Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, declaring `` we do not need to wait -LRB- for -RRB- convictions, or even trials,'' in the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> procurement affair, suspended payment on $ 1 billion worth of potentially tainted military contracts. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> acted on the basis of information included in search-warrant affidavits that were unsealed by a federal magistrate in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> on Thursday. In the documents, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said it eavesdropped as one consultant obtained and passed along inside information on nine contracts worth more than $ 522 million.

 Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Chappell </PERSON> said he had kept an `` arm's length'' away from a transaction in which a company headed by representatives of defense contractors reportedly intervened for him in a foreclosure case. <PERSON> Chappell </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Appropriations defense subcommittee, refused to discuss details of the complex transaction. But in a statement issued by his office, the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> Democrat said, `` If you are going to do something wrong, you do n't do it on the public record.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> plans to continue a $ 20 million artificial heart research program that had been scheduled to be shelved in the fall, according to <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and administration officials. The reversal means that research contracts at centers in six states wo n't be halted at the end of September, but rather will continue for about 5 -LCB- years as originally planned. The program's goal is to develop a totally implantable electric heart The National Heart, Lung and <ORGANIZATION> Blood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, part of <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION>, said in May that it was suspending the program at the end of the fiscal year and shifting its focus instead to developing a left ventricular assist device, which would help a diseased heart pump blood. The decision provoked an outcry from senators in the states where the research centers are located. They called the decision `` an alarming U-turn'' and said the artificial heart program was a key component of the nation's leadership in biotechnology. Sens. <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., had threatened in a letter to insert an amendment into an appropriations bill to compel the heart, lung and blood institute to continue the contracts prior to undertaking new obligations Word that the contracts were being revived first came from <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, who relayed the news to a <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> center with a $ 5.5 million contract at stake. `` We heard and confirmed that the contract had been reinstated as of the end of the fiscal year, so that there will be no -LRB- funding -RRB- break,'' <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Bliss </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Biomedical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> said in a telephone interview Friday `` It was originally announced by Senator <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> and confirmed through our contacts at <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Bliss </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Deseret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> that he was told by <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenfant </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> institute, that artificial heart funding was being restored. <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> called the decision `` good news for the millions who will need artificial hearts or their components.'' There has been no announcement yet by <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> that the program is being resumed. However, an <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> official speaking on condition of anonymity said, `` The practicality is that a decision has been made'' and that an announcement was expected as soon as next week. The official stressed that the decision was not just a quick fix, and that it was anticipated that the program would continue as originally planned. Besides the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION>, the other centers conducting the research are the <ORGANIZATION> Hershey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Abiomed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Danvers </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, which is working with the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>; and the <ORGANIZATION> Nimbus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Rancho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cordova </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, which is working with the <ORGANIZATION> Cleveland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. The contracts begin early this year. In announcing that the pacts were being suspended, the <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> institute cited budgetary constraints and said it was not abandoning the total artificial heart concept. So far, all five patients who received the Jarvik-7 artificial heart as a permanent implantation have died within two years. The Jarvik-7 runs on compressed air and uses a portable power pack or other external machine. The program temporarily suspended by <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> is for development of an electric, totally implantable heart.

<TEXT>
 Despite rising teacher pay, the president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION> warns that rough days lie ahead for public schools unless there are radical changes in the nation's education system. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON> said he would deliver that message in his keynote address today to 3,000 AFT delegates at the start of their biennial convention. <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON>'s union released a report Friday that indicated <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> teacher salaries are at a record high _ $ 28,085 on average in 1987-88 _ and starting pay is up to $ 18,557 on average. But <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON>, an outspoken critic of traditional school structures, argues that schools fail to deliver an adequate education to 80 percent of all students. He recently proposed allowing groups of six to 12 teachers experiment with running their own schools-within-schools. He said in an interview that if teachers do n't take the lead in persuading the public to restructure schools, `` we're going to end up being dismantled out of existence.'' At a meeting of local AFT presidents Friday, <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Rourke </PERSON>, president of the union's innovative <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, local, suggested that the union convene a special conference next summer to look at its own structure. `` Maybe we need to take a real, hard look at the union from the bottom up,'' <PERSON> O'Rourke </PERSON> said. `` Even the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> is doing that.'' Two AFT vice presidents, <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON>, the head of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> McElroy </PERSON>, head of the <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> federation, told the 125 local presidents that the Executive Council already is doing some self-examination The delegates will vote Sunday on whether to expand the council from 36 to 40 members. <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON>, 59, president of the nation's second-largest teachers union since 1974, is running for re-election Monday with no announced opposition. The 665,000-member AFT represents nearly a half-million of the nation's 2.4 million public school teachers, primarily in big cities. The 1.9 million-member <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which opens its convention Monday in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, is the nation's largest teachers union with 1.5 million teachers <PERSON> McElroy </PERSON> distributed a letter he sent to <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON> in January urging a wide-ranging review of the union. `` We seem to take for granted that the people who have led our unions for the past 20 years will always be there,'' he wrote. The AFT salary report singled out <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> as the state with the biggest increase in average salaries last year: 15.8 percent to $ 33,776, fifth in the nation. The highest-paid teachers are in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, where they received $ 40,510 on average; the lowest-paid are in <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, with an average of $ 20,340 last year, the AFT said. The report said teachers earned 17 percent more on average than all American workers in 1987 and 10 percent more than all government workers. On Tuesday, the delegates will hear from Democratic presidential candidates <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> via a satellite television hookup. Also on the convention's agenda is the consideration of several resolutions, including one that would put the union on record as opposing standardized tests for kindergarten students.

 Maoist guerrillas and police fought a gunbattle aboard an interstate bus carrying 80 passengers, killing three people, police said. A policeman, a Shining Path rebel and a bus passenger were killed and another policeman was wounded in Friday's shootout, police said. The violence occurred before dawn on <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s major coastal route near <LOCATION> Pisco </LOCATION>, 135 miles south of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>. The bus was traveling along the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Ica </LOCATION>, 180 miles south. Police said six Shining Path guerrillas forced the privately owned bus to stop by firing machine guns into the air and boarded the vehicle, demanding to see the passengers' papers. The bus riders dived for cover behind their seats as two policemen passengers opened fire. The rebels fired back and fled moments later. Maoist guerrillas frequently halt buses and steal passengers' valuables as an `` insurgency tax. The rebels normally check documents and kill any police or government officials they find. The government says nearly 600 policemen have been among the more than 10,000 people slain in violence related to the Shining Path's eight-year fight to impose Marxist rule in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Abelardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbosa </PERSON>, a free-wheeling comic who liked to say his goal was to confuse everything but who worked to forge a distinctly Brazilian style of television, died of a heart attack. He was 70. <PERSON> Barbosa </PERSON>, known on his amateur hour as `` Chacrinha,'' or barnyard in <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION>, succumbed at his home in <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Janeiro </LOCATION> late Thursday, his family announced Friday. He had been ill for several months. His body lay in state Friday at <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hall </LOCATION>, where hundreds of fans and well-wishers, mostly poor, lined up to pay respects. Riot police took positions outside to prevent any emotional tumult among mourners. The entertainer was born in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s poor northeast region and graduated from medical school there. But he never practiced as a doctor, gravitating in the 1940s to <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Janeiro </LOCATION> and radio. He became a disc jockey and emcee. The entertainer delighted generations of Brazilian radio and television fans with his own brand of unpredictable antics. When television came to <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> in the 1960s, <PERSON> Barbosa </PERSON> became a legend with a amateur show called `` Chacrinha's <PERSON> Horn </PERSON>.'' His nonsense slogans and silly rhymes caught on throughout the country. Media critics said he represented the essence of `` Brazilian-ness'' and prevented television here from turning into an American clone. In a rare serious moment in an interview years ago, <PERSON> Barbosa </PERSON> said he felt he had brought a certain Brazilian originality to television, which he viewed as subject to foreign _ mostly <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> _ influence. On `` Chacrinha's <PERSON> Horn </PERSON>,'' Chacrinha, an overweight man with thick glasses and curly, white hair, generally sported an outlandish outfit making him look like a clown. If he did not appreciate performers, he would honk a horn in their faces and send them away in disgrace, prompting thunderous laughter from the audience. The program also highlighted <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s leading pop music singers and rock groups. Go-go girls gyrated in the background, smoke bombs exploded on stage, and cameras cut crazily from one shot to another with no apparent logic. `` I've come here to confuse everything,'' he often said in nose-tight closeups, and the phrase caught on nationwide. He also delighted fans with such gratuitous behavior as brandishing a pineapple or a slab of dried codfish and taunting the audience: `` Who wants this?'' `` Me, me,'' everyone would shout. `` Well, you ca n't have it. This stuff's expensive,'' he would retort and lob the item out of reach.

<HEAD>Melvin Belli's Wife Asking To End Marriage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The wife of attorney <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Belli </PERSON> says she wants to end her stormy marriage to the famed `` King of Torts,'' alleging he beat her and falsely accused her of having affairs with several celebrities. <PERSON> Lia </PERSON> <PERSON> Belli </PERSON>, 39, an unsuccessful state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> candidate in 1984, also accused her 80-year-old husband on Friday of briefly choking their 15-year-old daughter after he became enraged when his dogs were not allowed to roam their $ 6 million mansion. <PERSON> Belli </PERSON> on Friday cut short a three-week tour of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to return to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, according to a spokeswoman in his office, adding he could not be reached for comment. Mrs. <PERSON> Belli </PERSON>, who told police Tuesday an armed intruder fired two shots at her in her bedroom at 5 a.m., said she wants a legal separation and will seek a court order barring her husband from their home. `` When neither side is happy, the marriage should end quickly,'' she said. `` My heart is broken that throughout this whole thing he still has n't called me.'' She said she believed a `` hit man ... a daring professional'' was trying to kill her, emphasizing she did not think her husband was behind the attack. She claimed her stepson <PERSON> Caesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Belli </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Gretchen </PERSON>, have undermined her 16-year marriage by calling gossip columnists to report various affairs and by making such suggestions to her husband. Mrs. <PERSON> Belli </PERSON> and her friends said she was unable to model a low-cut gown at a local fashion show last November because of bruises around her upper chest and neck area and cuts on her arms. Mrs. <PERSON> Belli </PERSON> alleged her husband, angered by a phone call from his son about a legal matter, `` grabbed me by both arms and twirled me around and I hit the mirror,'' causing the cuts and bruises.

<HEAD>Coast Guard Seizes Ship Off Washington Coast With Marijuana Aboard</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A Panamanian ship believed to be carrying more than 50 tons of marijuana was under tow today after the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> opened fire on the vessel, boarded it and arrested the crew, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said. The `` Encounter Bay,'' a 180-foot converted oil-drilling vessel, was seized Thursday after it refused to stop and was expected to reach <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> on Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Lt. <PERSON> Eldo </PERSON> <PERSON> DeLong </PERSON> said Friday. A patrolling <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> C-130 aircraft spotted the ship Thursday several hundred miles off the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> coast in international waters, said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Petty Officer 1st Class <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Herlihy </PERSON>. The ship's home port on the stern was partly covered with white paint, <PERSON> DeLong </PERSON> said. Because the vessel was suspicious-looking, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> contacted the Panamanian embassy and got permission to board the ship and enforce <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> laws, <PERSON> DeLong </PERSON> said. Crew members aboard the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> cutter `` Boutwell'' tried to contact the master of the vessel by radio, flag hoist, and waving, <PERSON> Herlihy </PERSON> said. When those methods failed, the <PERSON> Boutwell </PERSON> fired 60 rounds of .50 - caliber bullets into the vessel's engine No one was injured, and there was no further resistance, he said. Damage to the vessel was minimal, <PERSON> DeLong </PERSON> said. Coast Guard crew members then boarded the vessel and immediately found four containers of marijuana on deck, <PERSON> DeLong </PERSON> said. `` There is believed to be in excess of 50 tons of marijuana -LRB- aboard -RRB-,'' Lt. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON> said. The seizure, worth an estimated $ 220 million, is one of the largest ever for the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Herlihy </PERSON> said. Authorities in 1985 seized 160 tons of marijuana off the coast of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. All the crew members on board were arrested, <PERSON> DeLong </PERSON> said, adding that he did not know how many crew members there were. The crew members will be taken into <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Customs custody when the vessel arrives in port, <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, Customs and drug enforcement officials will examine the ship and its cargo. The Coast Guard began towing the ship Thursday night, and <PERSON> Herlihy </PERSON> estimated the vessels would be traveling at six to eight knots, or seven to 10 mph.

 Americans planned parades, food fests and fireworks for the Fourth of July weekend, but the nation's worst drought in decades put a damper on many pyrotechnic displays because of fears of wildfires. And in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, authorities issued a weekend warning as millions of mosquitoes swept into the area from the <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION>. Organizers in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> expected more than 3 million visitors for the annual VP Fair, billed as `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s largest birthday party.'' Nine stages scattered across the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arch </LOCATION> grounds will be used by entertainers ranging from <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> to Chinese acrobats. Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is scheduled to speak at naturalization ceremonies for 300 people. The three-day fair also includes today's annual Veiled Prophet Parade _ staged by a secret social group, the <ORGANIZATION> Veiled </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prophet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> _ airshows, a hot air `` Balloonfest,'' an Olympic-qualifying bicycle race, a steamboat race, ethnic food and nightly fireworks displays. But in other parts of the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and elsewhere, Independence Day revelers will have to find alternatives to fireworks due to bans spurred by the dry weather. On Tuesday, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> signed an executive order banning private fireworks displays _ even sparklers. But local governments may make exceptions where conditions allow, and community fireworks will be permitted as long as there is adequate fire protection. Counties and communities in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and elsewhere also banned or restricted fireworks out of fear of setting grass and forest fires. `` The potential is there for a disaster this year,'' said <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Parr </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Riverside </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, fire prevention officer. `` The brush is dry and well-cured and the danger and potential for fires is a lot greater.'' But several <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> communities that had banned fireworks rescinded the bans after rain fell Thursday, easing the drought. Independence, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, came up with a novel way of celebrating the Fourth of July during the drought. The birthplace of President <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> will replace its traditional fireworks with a laser light show. After <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> <PERSON> Goode </PERSON> announced in May that his city's four-day <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Festival </ORGANIZATION> would be cut to only a few events on one day, a number of businesses and organizations donated money and other resources to help the city throw a weekend bash after all. The scaled-down festival starts today with the fifth annual July Fourth Restaurant Festival, where chefs from 21 restaurants will serve their specialties along the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, space agency workers will hold a special Fourth of July ceremony when they move Discovery to the launch pad to be readied for the first space shuttle mission since the Challenger tragedy. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilmers </PERSON>, one of the five astronauts slated to fly the early September mission, and <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> officials will watch from a flag-bedecked grandstand as the spaceship is rolled out of an assembly building at 12:01 a.m. Monday. In his Fourth of July message, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said each celebration of the holiday stirs `` the pure patriotism of childhood.'' `` With each flag, with each parade and picnic and burst of fireworks, we ca n't help but recall the first stirrings of our deep love for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' the president said. `` No matter how many Fourths we Americans have seen, every new one revives in our hearts the pure patriotism of childhood.'' In <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, rain and damp weather caused swarms of mosquitoes to breed and southwest winds, unusual for this time of year, have blown them from the <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION> by the millions into populated areas. Officials in the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> area issued a mosquito emergency and warned weekend revelers to arm themselves with repellent. `` In many, many parts of <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> we're experiencing landing counts on human beings of 50 per minute,'' said <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Conner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s assistant director of public works. `` That is, you walk out in your back yard and you have 50 mosquitoes on you in one minute.''

<HEAD>Thousands Of British Homing Pigeons Get Lost</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Thousands of valuable racing pigeons have failed to find their way home from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> since they flew off June 25 in a cross-Channel competition. <PERSON> Pigeon </PERSON> owners believe the pigeons' internal navigation systems were thrown off course, possibly by microwave ovens, radar signals, radio frequencies or a solar flare. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, secretary of the <LOCATION> Sheffield </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Homing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pigeon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>, called it `` a disaster on a vast scale.'' More than 5,000 birds were released in <LOCATION> Nevers </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, for what should have been a 14-hour sprint home to northern <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, where pigeon racing is a popular betting sport. But by Friday night, only 1,500 had arrived home. `` The really appalling thing, from the pigeon fancier's point of view, is that these are the best birds,'' said ornithologist <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Mead </PERSON>. Some of the pigeons are worth more than $ 54,300. The pigeons use the Earth's magnetic field to navigate, and several theories have emerged to explain how they got lost. <PERSON> Derek </PERSON> <PERSON> Towers </PERSON>, secretary and manager of the Up North Combine, thought a solar flare _ an explosion of gases on the surface of the sun _ upset the birds. `` Electrically charged particles are sent out through space and when they reach us it disorients the pigeons,'' he said. `` This happened once before, years ago, when a magnetic pulse went through the atmosphere.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> said the weather, which has been temperate, was probably not to blame. `` It is very puzzling,'' she said. `` Some owners believe it was due to airplanes breaking down the sound barrier which sent -LRB- the pigeons -RRB- off course,'' she said. `` Others blame microwave ovens, radar and radio signals. `` If aerosols can punch a hole in the atmosphere, these ideas may not be as silly as they first sound,'' she said. Mrs. <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> said many of the pigeon owners in <LOCATION> Sheffield </LOCATION>, which entered 600 birds in the race, were holding vigils from dawn to dusk in the hope of spotting their birds. The <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday that at least one bird had been found among the street pigeons that congregate in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Trafalgar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Defense fraud scandal figure <PERSON> Melvyn </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> was the subject of an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> probe while he was assistant <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> secretary in 1983 that examined allegations of bribery and electronic eavesdropping, the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported today. However, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney declined to prosecute <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> following the probe that covered a time when he was an executive for the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>, the newspaper reported in today's editions. <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Barcella </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, dismissed the report as `` a regurgitation of unfounded allegations that have been examined many times.'' According to the Times, <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>'s main accuser was <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Durst </PERSON>, who was an executive with <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Durst </PERSON>, who left <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> in 1977, said he told the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> presented `` an extraordinary risk to the security of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> presented its findings on <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>'s activities while at <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> to then-U.S. Attorney <PERSON> Elsie </PERSON> <PERSON> Munsell </PERSON>, whose <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, office is heading a nationwide investigation into defense procurement fraud. The newspaper, citing an unidentified source familiar with the investigation, said Ms. <PERSON> Munsell </PERSON> declined to prosecute <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> in part because the statute of limitations on the electronic eavesdropping, which allegedly took place in 1970, had expired. She also declined to prosecute, the source said, because <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>, on whose behalf <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> had allegedly paid bribes, had already pleaded guilty to charges of failing to disclose at least $ 7 million in commissions it paid to overseas agents to help win airline orders. <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>, who has worked as a consultant since he left his <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> post last year, is one of the central figures in the ongoing defense procurement fraud probe. Federal investigators contend that after leaving the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> obtained classified information about defense contracts and sold it to his clients. Ms. <PERSON> Munsell </PERSON> declined to discuss the investigations conducted during her five-year tenure as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>, who succeeded her in 1986, and who is managing the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> fraud investigation, also declined to comment. <PERSON> Barcella </PERSON>, who had worked as a federal prosecutor for 16 years, minimized the significance of <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents presenting their investigation of <LOCATION> Paisley </LOCATION> to a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney. `` That does n't necessarily indicate the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> thought there was a case,'' he said. `` There were thousands of petty things agents came to me with.'' <PERSON> Barcella </PERSON> also described <PERSON> Durst </PERSON> as `` a disgruntled former employee whose record on credibility is pretty thin.'' In addition to naming <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>, <PERSON> Durst </PERSON> also implicated <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaines </PERSON>, <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>'s aide at <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>, in a three-page letter dated Oct. 10, 1983, that he sent to the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Gaines </PERSON>, who also worked for <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> as a deputy at the Pentagon, is accused of supplying classified material to <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> when the former <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> official left the service to become a defense consultant, according to sources close to the investigation.

 Defense consultant <PERSON> Melvyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> has gone to court to get the affidavit secretly filed by federal investigators to search his office for evidence in the Pentagon bribery probe. <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>'s lawyers in their request Friday for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON> to expedite consideration of their motion said they needed the affidavit to help advise their client on how to comply with `` numerous subpoenas'' issued in the case. Those subpoenas are due on July 19, according to the court papers. <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Barcella </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Plotkin </PERSON>, attorneys representing <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Vicki </PERSON>, asked <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON> to convene a July 8 hearing to consider their request to obtain the supporting affidavit. `` Additionally, the massive and pervasive publicity given this matter already may have irreparably tainted the decision-making process of the grand jury and seal may prevent further taint,'' the lawyers said in asking the judge to keep under seal their detailed request to see the affidavit. In a related development, The <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported in today's editions that sources have told the newspaper <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> was the subject of a 1983 <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> probe that examined allegations of bribery and electronic eavesdropping. The newspaper, citing an unidentified source familiar with the 1983 investigation, said then-U.S. Attorney <PERSON> Elsie </PERSON> <PERSON> Munsell </PERSON> declined to prosecute <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> following the probe in part because the statute of limitations on the electronic eavesdropping, which allegedly took place in 1970, had expired. She also declined to prosecute, the source said, because the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>, on whose behalf <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> had allegedly paid bribes, had already pleaded guilty to charges of failing to disclose at least $ 7 million in commissions it paid to overseas agents to help win airline orders. Both Ms. <PERSON> Munsell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>, who succeeded her in 1986 and is now managing the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> fraud investigation declined comment. <PERSON> Barcella </PERSON> dismissed the report as `` a regurgitation of unfounded allegations that have been examined many times.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, took steps to ensure that no additional affidavits or search warrants are disclosed in the Pentagon bribery probe. Most of the affidavits which the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> is required to submit to justify a search remain sealed. But two were released Thursday by a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> magistrate in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. They reveal that court-ordered wiretaps and office bugging devices captured the relay of confidential, inside information on nine defense contracts worth more than $ 522 million. The magistrate in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> released the two affidavits because the government had asked that they remain sealed for 14 days, until June 30. The government also has opposed a motion by <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Tallia </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> offices, to allow them and their legal counsel to view an affidavit that supported a search warrant for the offices. The facilities were searched June 14. The search focused on the relationship between <LOCATION> Tallia </LOCATION> and two consultants, <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON>. The government's request, also filed Friday in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, said that to disclose any but small portions of the affidavit would jeopardize an ongoing criminal investigation. The affidavit pertaining to <LOCATION> Paisley </LOCATION> has been kept under court seal since federal investigators obtained the warrant to search <ORGANIZATION> Paisley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on June 14. His lawyers said that unless they have an opportunity to inspect the affidavit, they `` will be substantially hindered and delayed in providing effective advice and representation to applicant and in determining the appropriate response to the subpoenas and to the propriety of the search warrant.'' <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>, a former assistant <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> secretary for research, left the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> in 1987 to become a consultant to several defense contractors. <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>'s telephone has been tapped and his consulting office bugged during much of the two-year investigation. Federal authorities this week opposed another request to unseal an unrelated search-warrant affidavit in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> on the grounds that evidence sought in the case had been destroyed before it could be examined by investigators. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Korten </PERSON> said that `` we'll double-check and make sure we do n't encounter similar problems'' in other courts around the country containing more than 40 sealed search warrants and affidavits that are part of the investigation

<HEAD>British TV Company Reportedly Buying MTM</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, a British production company, has agreed to buy <ORGANIZATION> MTM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, an independent <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> company co-founded by actress <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, in a deal worth about $ 325 million, a newspaper reported. The British company, known as TVS, said it could neither confirm nor deny Friday's report in the <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, but said its chief executive <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Gatward </PERSON> would make a statement at a news conference here on July 6. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said the deal was struck in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> on Thursday after all-night negotiations, prompting a suspension of trading in TVS shares on the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> MTM </ORGANIZATION>, a private <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> company which takes its name from Miss <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>'s initials, had planned a $ 100 million initial public stock offering last year but withdrew those plans after the October stock market crash. At that time, the company was valued at around $ 450 million and had after-tax profits of $ 26.1 million in the 1987 financial year, down from $ 30.6 million the previous year, according to the Times. Since <ORGANIZATION> MTM </ORGANIZATION> was founded in 1970, it has produced about 30 television series and more than a dozen made-for-TV movies. Among its hit TV series have been `` Hill Street Blues'' and `` St. Elsewhere,'' which have a large audience in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. In addition, <ORGANIZATION> MTM </ORGANIZATION> develops and produces theatrical movies and operates a record and music publishing company, <ORGANIZATION> MTM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Music </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>. TVS, although relatively small, screens its productions in southern <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, the most prosperous area of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> TVS productions are aired by <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- ITV -RRB-, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s two-channel national commercial network The non-commercial <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> runs the other two channels. TVS showed a pre-tax profit of 21.8 million pounds, or about $ 37 million, in the fiscal year ending last October. Revenue totaled 171.9 million pounds, or about $ 292.2 million. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said TVS has more than 25 million pounds, or $ 40 million, in cash and will finance the deal by issuing stock underwritten by the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> merchant bank <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> NatWest </ORGANIZATION>. It said the deal would give TVS production capacity in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, potential access to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> networks `` and a library of programs to sell across <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to television stations and cable and satellite.''

 Gunmen pulled a motorcycle beside the car of a human rights lawyer and shot him to death on a downtown street today. <PERSON> Emmanuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendoza </PERSON>, 57, was the third human rights lawyer killed in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> in as many weeks. A human rights group today suggested that the police or military could be involved in the unsolved slayings. Police Cpl. <PERSON> Porfirio </PERSON> <PERSON> Olais </PERSON> said two unidentified men on a motorcycle opened fire on <PERSON> Mendoza </PERSON> when he stopped his car at a busy intersection. A bystander brought the lawyer to a nearby hospital, where he died minutes later, police and hospital officials said. <PERSON> Mendoza </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Emilia </PERSON>, said in a radio interview that her husband had received several death threats from unidentified callers. The independent <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advocates </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Mendoza </PERSON>'s shooting could be related to his work as defense lawyer for slum residents whose communities have been raided by police in search of communist hitmen. <PERSON> Mendoza </PERSON> was a legal counsel of the left-wing BAYAN organization and chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Manila </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Solidarity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, a federation of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> slum residents' groups. His killing came two days after a failed assassination attempt on <PERSON> Nemesio </PERSON> <PERSON> Prudente </PERSON>, the left-wing president of the state-run <ORGANIZATION> Polytechnic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Philippines </ORGANIZATION>. Two weeks ago, gunmen also shot and killed human rights lawyer <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Cura </PERSON> in his home near <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clark </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION> north of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. A colleague, <PERSON> Alfonso </PERSON> <PERSON> Surigao </PERSON>, was shot and killed in his residence in the central Philippine island of <LOCATION> Cebu </LOCATION> last week. `` This series of killings has victimized personalities who have been associated with the legal left,'' a statement released by the human rights group said. `` That this could go on without the government being able to solve any single case raises the strong possibilities that certain segments of the police and the military could be involved in them,'' the statement added. Investigators have yet to publish findings on an earlier ambush on Prudente in November. Human rights groups blamed rightist death squads for that attack. It occurred a week after soldiers and policemen chanted `` Kill Prudente'' during a funeral for a police captain and three other people killed by communist assassins in the capital. The military and police had accused <PERSON> Prudente </PERSON>, an outspoken human rights activist, of using his school to shelter communist guerrillas. <PERSON> Prudente </PERSON> denied the charge. Also today, a government-run news agency said military authorities have filed a new subversion complaint against two Europeans and a Filipino of German descent accused of aiding communist rebels. Swedish national <PERSON> Stellan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hermansson </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> German </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> minister <PERSON> Klaus </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON>, and Filipino businessman <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON> were arrested June 8 and later held at a military camp, the <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said. On Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rejected the petition of the three men to drop charges of rebellion and kidnapping. It agreed, however, to place them under the custody of a church group while awaiting trial. In the new charges, the military said the three men were seen with communist <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas in four <LOCATION> Quezon </LOCATION> province towns from May 23 to 25 and on June 2 this year and instructed new rebel recruits, the agency said. Earlier, the military had accused them of taking part in a Feb. 3 raid in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> town in <LOCATION> Quezon </LOCATION> and taking hostage two policemen after the attack. <PERSON> Hermansson </PERSON> has said he arrived in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> for the first time in mid-May, and the other two said they were in the capital on the day of the Feb. 3 raid.

<HEAD>Report Says Pilot Error Most Likely Caused Helicopters' Collision</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TED M. NATT JR.</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FORT CAMPBELL, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 No action is warranted against anyone as a result of a collision of two Army helicopters in March, even though pilot error probably caused the accident that killed 17 soldiers, an <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> report says. The accident happened March 8 when a UH-60 Black Hawk returning from a solo instruction flight collided with the lead helicopter in a formation of three returning from a night training mission to pick up soldiers in the field. `` Up to the point of impact, the missions were formed just as briefed,'' said Maj. <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Schoel </PERSON>, public-affairs officer at the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> base. The report found that the collision `` was the result of the two air crews' being unable to see each other in the final moments of flight,'' according to a statement read by <PERSON> Schoel </PERSON> at a news conference Friday. The approximately 175-page report concluded, `` Pilot error, to wit, a reasonable mistake in judgment is the most probable explanation for the cause of this accident.'' But the report, compiled by an investigation board of six <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION> officers _ all aviators, said: `` There should be no action taken against anyone as no foundation for negligence can be established. The accident was not due to lack of diligence, nor unreasonable or unprofessional conduct.'' The investigation board found no evidence of a mechanical malfunction in the two <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hawks </ORGANIZATION> involved in the crash. `` Nor can it be confirmed that there were any procedural errors on the part of either crew,'' <PERSON> Schoel </PERSON> said. The report, however, cited other factors, including exterior and interior design characteristics of the UH-60 <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hawks </ORGANIZATION> and limited pilot training using night-vision goggles. The report noted a lack of lighting on the helicopters, and said the number and the size of position lights on the outside of the $ 4.6 million Black Hawk were inadequate. The helicopters were made by <ORGANIZATION> Sikorsky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> division of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said Staff Sgt. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> of the public information office at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Campbell </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Stratford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, late Friday, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stangrone </PERSON>, a Sikorsky spokesman, said: `` All aircraft have some degree of field-of-view limitation. Obviously, the ideal cockpit is a glass bubble with an unobstructed view. It's a matter of design tradeoffs that consider structural integrity, ballistic tolerance, survivability and so on. ... Design and operational tradeoffs also determine the extent and intensity of exterior aircraft lighting.'' The report said one of the two helicopters may not have had its anti-collision strobe light turned on as required at the time of the accident. `` That's the only item in question _ the strobe light,'' <PERSON> Schoel </PERSON> said. The lead helicopter, struck broadside, carried 13 soldiers. The other craft carried four. All 17 victims belonged to the 101st Airborne Division at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Campbell </LOCATION>. The other two helicopters landed safely.

<TEXT>
 Hay from Southern farmers hoping to repay a debt from their own 1986 dry spell arrived in drought-stricken <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, while <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>'s governor asked federal officials to declare his state a disaster area due to crop damage Also Friday, an economist estimated the drought could cause $ 3 billion in damage to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>'s economy this year. At <LOCATION> Cloverdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, farmer <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Meek </PERSON> accepted 180 bales of hay donated by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> farmers and trucked in Friday by volunteer off-duty <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, police. `` Our hay yield is down and what we're using now is what should be used next winter,'' he said. In 1986, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and 40 other states sent about 800,000 bales of hay to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> when the Southeast was suffering a severe dry spell. At <ORGANIZATION> Charlotte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, which was spared by the drought, farmers gathered a shipment of hay Friday to send to <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. `` Two years ago, I helped load a lot of hay in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> that went South,'' said <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>'s director of agriculture, <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Maurer </PERSON>, thanking the <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> farmers. `` Kind of in passing, I said ` Someday we might need a little help ourselves,' and little did I know it was just two years away.'' <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Celeste </PERSON> issued an executive order Friday that he said would speed delivery of hay to drought-stricken farmers and ban most outdoor burning, and he urged mandatory water use restrictions statewide. Also Friday, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> asked federal officials to declare <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> a disaster area, citing `` widespread damage to corn, cotton, peanuts, soybeans, grain sorghum, hay and pasture crops.'' In a letter to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> said it was estimated that 30 percent to 50 percent of the state's crops were damaged by the drought In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> said the federal government likely will support financial aid to farmers once losses are more fully known. After briefing President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on the findings of an interagency task force on the drought, the secretary told reporters that long-range weather forecasts are discouraging. Meanwhile, administration officials disclosed that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will fly to <LOCATION> Davenport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, July 14 to view drought damage. Despite up to 2 inches of rain this week, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> had its driest half-year on record, said <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hillaker </PERSON>, acting state climatologist. In the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, last month turned out to be the driest June since records began in 1890, said <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Vines </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Authority </LOCATION>. Of the <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION>'s 220 rain monitoring stations, 39 recorded nothing during June _ also a record For today, showers and thunderstorms were predicted from the lower <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> through the western parts of the lower <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> and central Gulf Coast into central and southern <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. The drought has cost <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> farmers $ 530 million in small grain losses this year, while livestock producers suffered $ 225 million in losses caused by the drought, said <PERSON> Arlen </PERSON> <PERSON> Leholm </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dakota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> agricultural economist. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> farmers also stand to lose as much as $ 473 million in federal deficiency payments, the result of soaring crop prices, and must recover some of that if the state is to get through the drought, <PERSON> Leholm </PERSON> said. Leholm estimated <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>'s total financial loss as $ 2.4 billion to $ 3 billion, including the impact of lost farm income that would have `` turned over'' several times in the state. <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s crops have suffered as much as $ 600 million in damage and that figure will climb higher unless rain soon soothes parched fields, the state's agriculture director said.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> defense industry is feeling the first shock waves of the military procurement investigation, as <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> announced suspension of payments on $ 1 billion worth of contracts. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>'s surprise action was based on information in search-warrant affidavits unsealed by a federal magistrate in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> on Thursday. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, who earlier had urged caution in reacting to the investigation, declared at a news conference that `` wherever we have specific evidence we will take action.'' Pentagon officials said that the impact of the suspension on the companies and their workers would depend on each of the scores of contracts involved, and possibly on the financial health of the company. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> also announced that the Pentagon was beginning suspension procedures against three individuals and a company named in the documents, and he said the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> was reviewing existing contracts with four implicated companies and freezing new contracts on nine weapons systems. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has initiated suspension procedures with respect to <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON>, <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> division of <ORGANIZATION> Varian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'' <ORGANIZATION> Varian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> was the 155th largest defense contractor for 1986 and its parent company <ORGANIZATION> Varian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> received more than $ 81.76 million in defense awards in that year, according to the unsealed affadavit. He said the current actions did not gravely impair national security. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Varian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, said the suspension will affect only one of <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION>' military projects, developing low frequency transmitters <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> says he does n't know the value of the contract, but it represents `` only a very small part'' of <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION>' business `` so there would be no immediate impact on the firm. He said the company was `` surprised and disappointed'' by the suspension because it had been told it was not a target of the investigation. `` Allegations, alone, are not the basis for such action,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported today that among the companies whose payments have been interrupted are the <ORGANIZATION> Canadian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marconi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Litton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> TRW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said the Pentagon was reviewing existing contracts with four companies named in the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> affidavits _ <ORGANIZATION> Litton </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Norden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Hazeltine </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Emhart </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Norden </PERSON>, based in <LOCATION> Norwalk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, is a division of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the eighth largest defense contractor in 1987 with deals totalling $ 3.3 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Litton </ORGANIZATION> was the 14th biggest, with contracts worth $ 2 billion. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> is based in <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Litton </ORGANIZATION> has offices in <LOCATION> Van </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nuys </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> `` We do not know what the allegations are, if any, or the government's basis for stopping payments,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Litton </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Thom </PERSON> <ORGANIZATION> Emhart </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON>, said the <LOCATION> Farmington </LOCATION>, Conn.-based company will `` comply fully and expeditiously because we're confident nothing improper will be found. `` <ORGANIZATION> Hazeltine </ORGANIZATION> continues to cooperate fully with authorities in the investigation,'' said a statement issued on behalf of the <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, N.Y.-based company. The largest single weapons system on which payments are being frozen is called the Anti-Submarine Operating Center, a $ 712 million system of shore-based command and control centers to coordinate efforts to locate and destroy submarines. <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON>, one of the three individuals named by <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, is a former <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> procurement officer convicted of and fired for stock trading on insider <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> information in 1982. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON> was receiving inside contract data from Stone, his <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> successor, and it `` believes that <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON> is paying Stone for this information.'' Stone is one of six <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials transferred to other duties after their offices were searched. The third individual named by <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, has been placed on administrative leave from his job as vice president for marketing of <ORGANIZATION> Varian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> Palo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, according to a company spokesman. Meanwhile Friday, <PERSON> Norden </PERSON> announced it had withdrawn from competition on a contract to build a high-tech portable shelter used near a battlefield to control aircraft in all kinds of weather. The company cited the need for the public and government to `` have full confidence in the integrity of the ... procurement process.'' The other seven weapons systems on which new contract actions were suspended are: _ The <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Terminal </ORGANIZATION>, a $ 150 million program to develop a hand-held computerized unit to compose messages for transmission by field radios _ The Tactical Environmental Support System, a $ 58 million <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> program _ A $ 51 million fiber optical project _ The <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wideband </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> set, being developed at a cost of $ 49 million _ A $ 38 million anti-submarine warfare electronics display unit _ The $ 30 million <ORGANIZATION> Bancroft </ORGANIZATION> radio for tanks and <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> light armored vehicles _ A $ 6.3 million project to develop very low frequency and low frequency communications gear

 Seventy Soviet missile specialists arrived here to begin an unprecedented inspection of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> weapons factories as their <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> counterparts traveled to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to check Soviet sites. The landing of the Soviets' flight here Friday marked the first day that 26 missile sites in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and 126 Soviet sites became subject to superpower inspection. The inspections are provided by the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty signed Dec. 9 at the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> summit. `` The treaty creates a relatively new atmosphere of trust between our two nations,'' <PERSON> Vyacheslav </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lebedev </PERSON>, spokesman for the Soviet technicians, said in a brief statement to reporters. `` Our common task is to guarantee mutual trust.'' Under the treaty, the two countries each must destroy a pre-set number of their medium-range missiles. In <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> inspection teams, consisting of 10 experts each, met with reporters before boarding an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> jet for <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. `` We all feel this is a historic mission,'' said the head of the inspection agency, <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brig </ORGANIZATION>. Gen. <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Lajoie </PERSON>. One <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> team was bound for the Soviet city of <LOCATION> Votkinsk </LOCATION>, the site of a plant that formerly built the SS-20 missiles, the most important Soviet weapon to be eliminated under the treaty. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has the right to keep a team at <LOCATION> Votkinsk </LOCATION> for up to 13 years, and the Soviets may station inspectors for the same period at <ORGANIZATION> Magna </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, site of Hercules Plant No. 1, where <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> missiles were produced. Inspection teams will verify the destruction of 1,800 missiles and check on about 3,200 related components, including storage and transport missile containers and special hauling vehicles, <PERSON> Lajoie </PERSON> said. The Soviets' silver-and-white <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION> IL-62, sporting the Soviet flag on its tail, was an odd site on the tarmac here next to a B-52 bomber and a C-5 Galaxy cargo craft, parked for a July 4 show at the air base 50 miles northwest of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. After a 17-hour flight from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, the all-male inspection team, dressed in civilian suits as required by the treaty, looked bemused as reporters clamored over each other for a glimpse and to hear their statement. Col. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Smalls </PERSON>, team chief for the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION>'s new <ORGANIZATION> On-Site </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inspection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, said the Soviets would announce later which missile sites they will inspect besides the one at <ORGANIZATION> Magna </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>. Twenty-two inspectors are headed there. The destinations of the remaining 48 Soviets are not required to be made public immediately by the Soviets, said Lt. Col <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagovich </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> On-Site </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inspection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. The treaty allows the two sides to visit the other country on 16 hours' notice and then permits them to wait 48 hours after their arrival before giving notification of the exact sites they will visit. From <PERSON> Travis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Wagovich </PERSON> said, the Soviets could travel to as many as five additional sites, located in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huachuca </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Davis-Monthan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>; Dugway, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Pueblo </PERSON>, <PERSON> Colo </PERSON>. The Soviets have yet to announce when they will send inspectors to visit several sites in the Eastern states. <PERSON> Wagovich </PERSON> said <PERSON> Travis </PERSON>' 60th <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlift </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wing </ORGANIZATION> will have nine hours after the Soviets announce their intended destinations to fly them to those sites. The Soviet air crew members likely will remain at <LOCATION> Travis </LOCATION> during the `` baseline inspections,'' which under the treaty can last a maximum 24 hours unless both superpowers agree to extend them another eight hours, he said. The baseline inspections are designed to verify the exact number of missiles and related components to be destroyed under the treaty within the next three years. Reporters will not to be allowed to accompany the teams. The Soviet technicians will be escorted by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> missile technicians and specialists in linguistics and security.

 Stock prices fell for the second day on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> today after prices fell on Wall Street and the dollar posted strong gains against the yen. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which lost 265.87 points Friday, fell another 141.01 points, or 0.5 percent, to end today's half-day session at 27,362.52. Traders said the loss was due mainly to the appreciation of the dollar, which ended the week's trading in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> Friday at 134.50 yen, its highest level this year, and because of concerns over possible higher interest rates. `` The strength of the dollar and profit-taking were behind the market's fall yesterday -LRB- Friday -RRB-, and the market is still adjusting,'' said <PERSON> Michio </PERSON> <PERSON> Katsumata </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s largest brokerage. A trader who spoke on condition of anonymity said worry over higher interest rates led to losses for some large-capital issues, while the lower yen pushed some export-oriented issues higher. Among the gainers were <ORGANIZATION> Hitachi </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Fujitsu </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> NEC </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> TDK </ORGANIZATION>, Pioneer and <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION>. Volume on the market's first section was estimated at 900 million shares. On Friday, 2.6 billion shares were traded.

<TEXT>
 Members of an pro-Iranian underground fundamentalist group arrested in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> were planning to go to <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> to create disturbances during the annual Moslem pilgrimage, a newspaper reported. <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>'s Arabic-language newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Akhbar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Al-Khaleej </ORGANIZATION> on Friday quoted Egyptian investigators as saying that Iranian intelligence officers had recruited the group as well as others in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. It said the groups were expected to work together. Twenty members of the Egyptian-based group were to smuggle arms and explosives to <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, organize demonstrations and distribute hostile leaflets calling for `` internationalization of the two holy shrines,'' the Cairo-datelined report said. It quoted the investigators as saying that members of the group confessed to links with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s paramilitary Revolutionary Guards, the pro-Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Lebanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> party, and the underground Iraqi party called Al-Daawa. The shrines at <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Medina </PERSON> are <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>'s holiest, and the <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> ruling family is considered their custodian. Moslem pilgrims from all over the world converge annually on the kingdom for the pilgrimage, called the hajj, which falls this year in the latter part of July. Demonstrations the Iranian pilgrims last year sparked clashes with <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> police that left 402 people dead, 275 of them Iranians. The Saudi authorities said they died in a stampede, while the Iranians claim <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> police shot them. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> has limited pilgrims from each country to 1 per 1,000 people in any country, setting an expected Iranian quota of 45,000. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has said that if it can not send its usual 150,000 pilgrims, it will boycott the event but that other groups will demonstrate against the Saudi government.

 Law enforcers say luck was with them when they made what is believed to be the nation's largest drug seizure outside <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, a 6,000-pound shipment of pure cocaine hidden inside blocks of chocolate. `` It was a cold hit,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Baish </PERSON>, the agent in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, whose inspectors, working on a hunch, found the drugs. Authorities announced the seizure Friday, which they said has a retail value of about $ 480 million. The raid is likely to drive up the price of cocaine in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> area this summer, they said. Three Colombian nationals, believed to be members of a major Colombian drug cartel, were arrested when 50 agents raided the <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> Imports warehouse, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stutman </PERSON>, agent in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Customs inspectors stumbled upon the cocaine during a routine check aboard the ship <PERSON> Allison </PERSON> <PERSON> Lykes </PERSON> at a port in <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, on June 24, <PERSON> Baish </PERSON> said. Agents paid special attention to the shipment, 1,200 cartons marked `` unsweetened Ecuadorean coca chocolate,'' because <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION> is a source of cocaine, he said. They drilled into one of the cardboard boxes and hit a metal box hidden in the core of the hardened chocolate, said <PERSON> Baish </PERSON>. Agents opened up the carton and found the cocaine inside the metal box, he said. They resealed the box and kept a surveillance on the shipment with the help of electronic monitoring devices. The contraband was picked up Thursday by a trucking company hired by the smugglers. A team of narcotics agents then followed the trucks to the <LOCATION> Hicksville </LOCATION> warehouse, said <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Stiffel </PERSON> of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Customs in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The investigation determined that the drivers were not part of the drug scheme, <PERSON> Stiffel </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Stutman </PERSON> declined to say whether <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> Imports was connected to the scheme. He said more arrests were expected. Each carton weighed about 66 pounds. Each package of cocaine within weighed about six pounds and was marked with the initials of the person who had ordered it, said <PERSON> Stiffel </PERSON>. <PERSON> Stutman </PERSON> said at least 779 of the 1,200 cartons contained cocaine. A few hours after unloading the truck, the suspects began moving out four or five of the cartons and placing them into cars. At this point the agents moved in and arrested the unarmed defendants: <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunez </PERSON>, 28, of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yorks </ORGANIZATION>' Queens Borough; <PERSON> Absalon </PERSON> <PERSON> Borrero </PERSON>, 42, of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Caro </PERSON>, 48, of <LOCATION> Anz </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. All three were charged with importation and distribution of cocaine and conspiracy to distribute cocaine. They were ordered held without bail at their arraignment before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Chrein </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Borough </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Stutman </PERSON> said the suspects were believed to be members of the <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> family of <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, one of three leaders in cocaine trafficking. Officials believe the cocaine was produced in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and shipped to <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>, where it was concealed in the cocoa powder bricks. `` This is the largest seizure in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> outside of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Stutman </PERSON>. The largest haul of cocaine on record was made in May, when authorities seized 8,800 pounds in <LOCATION> Tarpon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>.

 A wedge of salt water creeping up the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> could begin tainting <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>' water supply in a week despite federal efforts to build a dike to slow the intrusion, a university professor says. The salt water from the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, flowing upstream because the worst drought in decades has weakened the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>'s flow, is traveling about two miles per day and was within 17 miles of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> on Friday. When the salt water first reaches the city, on about July 10, the contamination will be minimal, but by July 20 the salinity of the city's water could hit 200 parts per million, said <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professor emeritus <PERSON> Raphael </PERSON> <PERSON> Kazmann </PERSON>. That would make the water drinkable but `` make the coffee taste lousy,'' he said. In addition, the salt water could corrode appliances such as water heaters and dishwashers, he said. By the end of the month, the salinity probably will reach 300 ppm, which is above federal drinking water standards although it can be tolerated by most healthy people, he said. By the end of June the salt water had traveled as far upriver as it had on Oct. 8, 1965, a severe drought year, <PERSON> Kazmann </PERSON> said. The river is usually at its lowest point in the fall, and that does n't bode well for <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> in 1988, he warned. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> began construction Thursday on a $ 947,000 sand and clay barrier that will stretch 1,200 feet along the contours of the river bottom about 63 miles from where the river meets the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Construction is expected to take less than a month, spokesman <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Sossaman </PERSON> said Friday. Salt water hugs the river bottom because it is heavier than fresh water. It is advancing up the river because the drought-induced low flow is not rapid enough to push it back to the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. The upper point of the saltwater wedge is about 15 miles past the dike the Corps is building, <PERSON> Sossaman </PERSON> said. `` The levee is not as good an idea as it was before,'' said <PERSON> Frederic </PERSON> <PERSON> Chatry </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>' Engineering Division. `` But we're not trying to solve the saltwater intrusion problem. We're just trying to mitigate the part of saltwater intrusion caused because we deepened <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pass </ORGANIZATION> 5 feet ... last fall and winter. <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pass </LOCATION> is a primary navigation channel for entering the river from the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. To compensate for the salt water's movement and to make up for lost time, the Corps might build the sand and clay sill slightly higher than originally planned, <PERSON> Chatry </PERSON> said. Residents of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> and the several other communities who get their drinking water from the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> should n't panic, <PERSON> Sossaman </PERSON> said At first, the salt water will not perceptibly change the taste of the city's water supply, he said. If the salinity increases, it should only pose problems for those under salt-restrictive diets. So far, abnormal salinity has not registered at the city's water intakes, said Sewerage and <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Puglia </PERSON>. The board is working with the state and the <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> but has no citywide plan, he said. Saltwater intrusion in the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> is not uncommon, <PERSON> Sossaman </PERSON> noted. Communities close to the Gulf of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> experience the problem every summer with varying degrees of severity. `` Because of the drought, this summer it will probably go up higher and stay longer,'' he said, adding it could go as far as 75 miles upstream to <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La </LOCATION>. Autumn rains should help force the salt water back to the Gulf, he said.

 New appraisals of a proposed prison site for which Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' administration has asked $ 10 million to buy from developers put the value of the land at under $ 6 million, according to sources. The state wants to build a 500-bed prison on the hilltop land in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Braintree </LOCATION>. Developers, who one critic of the project alleges are friends of the Democratic presidential candidate, sought $ 9.5 million for the land two years ago. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> is conducting a preliminary inquiry into allegations that the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> administration leaked word to the developers of state interest in the land. They bought it from a church for $ 3 million. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> says is not under investigation himself, and the developers deny the allegation or any association with each other. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, asked about the controversy in recent weeks, has reiterated his position that the state will `` not pay one dime more'' than the fair market value of the property. Three sources, all speaking on the condition of anonymity, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on Friday that two appraisals listed the value of the hilltop land in the $ 5 million to $ 6 million range. The sources would not provide exact figures on the appraisals but one said they were `` not far apart.'' The appraisals are being reviewed by a third company, which is scheduled to submit its estimate of the property's worth next week. All three will be used by the state to determine how much to offer for the 782 acres bought by two developers in December 1985. Selection of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Braintree </LOCATION> site in 1986 by <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for a medium security prison has been controversial from the outset, with local residents claiming a prison would ruin the tiny central <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> community. The land _ which houses a defunct church academy, 20 homes and more than 700 acres of farmland _ is owned by developers <PERSON> Danial </PERSON> <PERSON> Striar </PERSON> and Dr. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON>. If they reject the state's offer for the land, the state can take it by eminent domain, a move that likely would end up in court. The developers could not be reached Friday for comment. The chief critic of the prison project, <PERSON> Dorothea </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas-Vitrac </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Braintree </LOCATION>, has made the allegation that the men are close associates of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and were tipped off about the state's plans. In denying the allegations, <PERSON> Striar </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> have said they met once, at a 1986 ground-breaking ceremony. <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON> grew up in the same neighborhood as <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and has donated to his campaigns. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has said he knows of <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON> from childhood but has no personal or business dealings with him. In April 1986, nearly two years after the administration began eyeing <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Braintree </LOCATION> for a prison but a month before <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> officially announced the siting, a <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> company hired by the state put the value of the land at $ 8.7 million. The appraiser, the <ORGANIZATION> R.J. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Greely </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, told the state in a report that its review `` is not to be considered a complete appraisal. Due to time constraints and other limiting conditions, we are doing this report in ` broad brush' terms, without having time to do our own research.'' As part of a larger prison funding package, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in May 1986 requested $ 22 million for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Braintree </LOCATION>, $ 10 million of which was to be set aside to purchase the land. <PERSON> Striar </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON> offered it to the state for $ 9.5 million. Critics of the prison, led by <PERSON> Thomas-Vitrac </PERSON>, complained that <PERSON> Striar </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON> stood to make more than $ 6 million on the deal without improving the site. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and other administration officials said they sought the $ 10 million appropriation to avoid waiting another year to have the money included in the next state budget.

The attacks on the 268,081-ton Greek-owned Fortuneship L and the 284,299-ton Iranian-owned <ORGANIZATION> Khark </ORGANIZATION> 4 raised fears of a new round of shipping raids by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> in the so-called `` tanker war.'' Both ships were still blazing 12 hours after the attacks. Shipping executives, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they had no word of casualties in the latest raids. The tankers were at the end of a convoy that had loaded at the <LOCATION> Kharg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> terminal in the northern gulf and was sailing south for <PERSON> Larak </PERSON>, another terminal in the <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION>, the entrance to the gulf. The last Iraqi strike on Iranian shipping was June 8 when warplanes attacked the 742-ton Singapore-flagged tugboat Salverve. Two seamen were killed. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s last raid was June 14, when gunboats attacked the Singapore-flagged <ORGANIZATION> Neptune </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Subaru </ORGANIZATION>, setting it on fire. The main focus of the nearly 8-year-old gulf war in recent months has been on the battlefield. The Iraqis have recaptured a series of border areas to gain an edge in the conflict with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Radio </LOCATION>, quoting a military communique, reported that <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> warplanes hit two `` large maritime targets,'' which usually means tankers, off the Iranian coast at 10 p.m. Friday -LRB- 3 p.m. EDT -RRB- and at 8 minutes after midnight -LRB- 5:08 p.m. EDT Friday -RRB-. The jets scored `` direct and effective hits'' and returned safely to base, the communique said. `` The raids were in line with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s determination to cut off the enemy's oil supplies and revenues which it uses to finance the war,'' the communique added. The Iraqis have been attacking tankers carrying Iranian oil since 1984 seeking to choke off <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s economic lifeline. The Iranians retaliate on a ship-for-ship basis. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s ports have been closed since the early days of the war, so the Iranians attack neutral merchant ships, mainly those serving <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> claims they aid <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. More than 500 ships have been attacked in the tanker war and more than 300 seamen have been killed. The Iranians gunboats have kept a low profile in recent weeks, with only three attacks reported since May 27. But shipping executives said today that an Iranian gunboat was active in the southern part of the waterway, raising fears that it was prowling for targets following <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s night-time air strikes. In <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> protested to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> an attack on an Iranian construction site and demanded compensation for the deaths of Korean workers. The Iraqi air force Thursday bombed a gas plant being built at <LOCATION> Kangan </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s southern gulf coast and the Cyrus oilfield in the northern gulf. The South Korean government said 12 Korean workers were killed, along with one Iranian, in the <LOCATION> Kangan </LOCATION> raid. <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> said another 45 Koreans were wounded. Meanwhile, a spokesman for <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Higher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> that thousands of male students have been sent to special camps for a month of military training The spokesman, who declined to be identified, said the students were drafted from <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s five universities and dozens of schools. The summer camps apparently were set up to boost <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s military reserves. An estimated 1 million Iraqis are currently under arms. Under compulsory military service, <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> men serve in the regular army for 24 months after graduation.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> fell in line behind <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and decreed sweeping political reforms to establish a stronger legislature and president and limit elected party officials to 10 years in office. The changes point the way to a new `` democratic image of socialism,'' the Soviet leader declared late Friday as he closed the four-day conference of 5,000 party members in the Kremlin. The party also will review the qualifications of each of its 20 million members this year, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION> said today. Such a review could be used to clean out the conservative opposition that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> says is still holding back his reforms. Pravda said the conference considered it necessary `` to carry out this year a report-election campaign in party organizations, governed by the decisions of the conference about reform of the political system, democratization of party life.'' The conference, the party's first since <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> assembled the 18th gathering in 1941, was urged to dismantle a system of power and privilege for party bureaucrats that has dominated Soviet society since the dictator's time. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told the party's policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and other organs urgently to settle questions of political reform so the plans the conference approved can be implemented beginning with a fall session of the Supreme Soviet parliament. He said the first elections under the reforms could be held in April 1989. The official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency said the plan approved by the conference also calls for a reorganization of the party apparatus before the end of the year, but gave no details. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukyanov </PERSON>, secretary of the party's <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, told a late-night news conference that the gathering backed <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s proposals to limit elected party officials to a maximum of two five-year terms with no exceptions. He also said the new, stronger presidency backed by the party meeting gives the president powers <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> requested to settle matters of foreign policy and chair the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. The latter position traditionally is held by the party general secretary, the post now held by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. It also approved his controversial recommendation that <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders become the leader of the corresponding legislature, all the way up to combining the job of president and party general secretary. That could set the stage for <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to further consolidate his grip on power by taking on the duties of the more powerful presidency. Candidate Politburo member <PERSON> Georgy </PERSON> <PERSON> Razumovsky </PERSON> said 209 delegates voted against that provision, an extremely rare show of dissent in the party. The presidency is now a largely ceremonial post held by <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON>. On Friday, <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON>, 78, was honored with the chairmanship of a session of the conference. On Thursday, <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Melnikov </PERSON>, party boss in the Russian republic's region of <LOCATION> Komi </LOCATION>, told the conference that <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON> and other high officials who served under <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> should be removed for contributing to the country's stagnation. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> on Friday referred to his proposals to create a new 2,250-member <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, a smaller and more active Supreme Soviet, and the new presidency: `` The conference will continue living in the society, in the discussions in the society, but now we know how we must transform the political system.'' The Soviet leader presided over what the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency called an `` unusually stormy and long'' debate over the resolutions, further reflecting the extraordinary spirit of open criticism permitted during the session. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, assessing the results of the conference just before it closed, said, `` Through democratization, economic reform and changes in the political system we will make perestroika irreversible. We will reach a fundamentally new state of our society, a new humane and democratic image of socialism.'' He also proposed building a monument in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s victims `` I think we must agree to this,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. `` This would be an honest step, and it will be supported by the entire <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> people.'' <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> has come under increasingly sharp criticism under <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of glasnost, or greater openness. But the decision to build a memorial to the millions of people executed or imprisoned during <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s rule is the most definitive step Soviet authorities have yet taken to repudiate him.

 The National Assembly today voted down President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON>'s nomination for chief justice in the first test of power in the new legislature. The rejection of <PERSON> Chung </PERSON> <PERSON> Ki-sung </PERSON> was the first time in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s 40-year constitutional history that a president's nomination of a chief justice has been turned down by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> It also was the first serious political setback for <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> since he took office on Feb. 25 with a narrow victory in December's presidential elections <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s government lost its majority in the legislature during elections in April. In another vote, the Assembly approved by a narrow margin <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s nomination of former lawyer <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Young-jun </PERSON> as head of the government's <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Audit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inspection </ORGANIZATION>, a Cabinet-level post The one-house Assembly rejected <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s nomination of <PERSON> Chung </PERSON> as chief justice by a narrow margin. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> backers mustered 141 votes, seven votes short of a simple majority required for approval. There were 295 lawmakers present in the 299-member Assembly. Six lawmakers voted against <PERSON> Chung </PERSON> while 134 others, mostly from the nation's two major opposition parties headed by <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Young-sam </PERSON>, abstained from voting in a coordinated anti-government gesture. There were 14 invalid votes. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s governing <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION>, which controls 125 sets, had been confident that it could muster enough votes with the help of a conservative opposition group. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Jong-pil </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, with 35 lawmakers, had publicly endorsed <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s nomination, but some of its members rebelled and voted against <PERSON> Chung </PERSON>. The nation's two major opposition groupings, the <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Reunification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, questioned <PERSON> Chung </PERSON>'s background under past authoritarian governments. <PERSON> Chung </PERSON>, 60, was named a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge in 1986 after holding various judicial posts for 29 years. The governing party lost its parliamentary majority in the April 26 elections for the first time since <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> was established in 1948. Also today, 101 Assembly members introduced a resolution urging <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to take part in this year's Olympic Games in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> and said it could build momentum for national unification. The resolution, sponsored by lawmakers from the governing and opposition parties, is to voted on next week. The North, which has demanded to be made a co-host of the Olympics, has said it will boycott the Olympics unless its request is met. The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Olympic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> have refused, but have offered to let it stage several events.

<HEAD>Robertson To Campaign For Bush, Sees Dole as Vice Presidential
Candidate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TACOMA, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Television evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, a speaker at today's state Republican convention, said he plans to campaign for Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in states where <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> had a stronger showing. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> also said he thinks the best vice presidential running mate for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said in a telephone interview Friday that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> asked him for help in bringing <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> supporters into the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> fold <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> easily carried the state's March 8 precinct caucuses and controls about 70 percent of the delegates at the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state GOP convention. `` The vice president wants me to be active in states where he did n't do as well as I did,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said. `` That would include <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. And I'll be going into the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> as a surrogate to bring the rather substantial movement that was supporting me to the elections for the vice president.'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> predicted a close election and said his followers could make the difference in a <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> victory. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s presence on the ticket would help. `` I do n't presume to tell <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> what to do but I think the strongest candidate we have for vice president is <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said. `` He brings strength in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> states to go along with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s strength in the East and the South. `` Plus, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s legislative experience along with <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s foreign policy experience would make a nice balance and make for a very strong ticket,'' he said <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, who spoke to the convention banquet Friday evening, said he would be willing to discuss the vice presidency. `` I'm not campaigning for it. I'm not seeking it,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said, but added if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called him, `` I'd say very honestly I'd be happy to discuss it.'' The Robertson-dominated convention is expected to adopt an ultra-conservative platform, including support for <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s position on apartheid The platform reads like a compendium of conservative thought. It is against gay rights, a state income tax, abortion, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, and school health clinics, and for the deployment Strategic Defense Initiative of space-based weapons, Contra aid `` everywhere,'' prayer in the schools and more nuclear development. The state convention is poised to send the nation's largest <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> delegation, apparently 38 delegates, to the national GOP convention in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> next month.

<TEXT>
 Plans for peace in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> are piling up as <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> withdraws its troops from the country and opposition groups prepare to meet for informal talks this month. The intensified search for a political settlement appears to have been sparked by fears from several sides that the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> could return to power. The communist <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> defeated a U.S.-backed government in 1975 and, according to some estimates, killed 3 million Cambodians before they were toppled by the Vietnamese invasion of 1978. Special <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> envoy <PERSON> Rafeeuddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> has returned from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> after presenting a peace plan, the details of which have not been disclosed. And the foreign ministers of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> reportedly will unveil another plan when they meet in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> next week. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> proposed Friday that all Cambodian factions form a coalition government before a total Vietnamese pullout. The <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> plan, which includes a call for all Cambodian parties to freeze their force levels, is an apparent effort to keep the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> from becoming dominant. Western analysts say <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the main weapons supplier to the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, is a key to the success of any negotiated settlement. The anti-Vietnamese resistance, a coalition of three groups led by Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, on June 25 issued proposals stressing international supervision of a <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> agreement. The plan is directly tied to the informal talks scheduled for July 25 in <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and the <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> coalition, which includes the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, have already accepted invitations to the talks. The coalition includes the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> and the non-communist <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. he official Cambodian news agency <ORGANIZATION> SPK </ORGANIZATION> said Friday that Prime Minister <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> received an invitation but did not say whether the government would attend. The resistance has proposed that <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> withdraw its forces in three stages under international supervision. It also said the coalition and the <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> government should be dissolved and a four-party coalition government set up and headed by <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>. The coalition would then hold free elections. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has promised a total withdrawal of its forces from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> by 1990 and has begun a partial pullout of 50,000 troops and withdrawn top military command. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> said the conduct of the anti-guerrilla war now will be directed by the Cambodians. According to local newspapers, the Southeast Asian foreign ministers will consider a plan worked out by senior officials of their bloc. It includes a general ceasefire; the pullout of all <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> forces in three phases; the end of all foreign military support for combatants and an international peacekeeping force that would remain in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> for five years. A Phnom Penh broadcast made available today indicated some problems with the proposal brought to <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> by the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> envoy. <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> was quoted by the official broadcast as describing the meeting as an `` initial'' one and urged the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to `` continue seeking to understand all the points upon which all the Cambodian parties agree or do not agree with each other.'' <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> `` stressed that all solutions to the Cambodian problem must absolutely guarantee'' the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> does not return to power, the radio said.

 Israeli troops shot and killed an Arab youth in a demonstration today in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> ton of <LOCATION> Jenin </LOCATION>, Israeli radio said. Protests broke out in at least four other <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> towns. Arab assailants also hurled a firebomb today at troops in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> but no injuries were reported, the army said. An army spokeswoman denied soldiers opened fire in <LOCATION> Jenin </LOCATION>, where the death was reported, or in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Kalandia </LOCATION>, where a youth was said to have suffered a bullet wound. `` We have had a report from the hospital that a man died and the army is checking if there is a connection,'' the military spokeswoman, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` The army did not see a body; the army used gas and rubber bullets only.'' Israeli radio said the <LOCATION> Jenin </LOCATION> youth was shot in the head and his body was taken from the hospital by his family. It said the clash with soldiers erupted after masked men entered schools and brought schoolchildren out to demonstrate. A hospital official in <LOCATION> Jenin </LOCATION> confirmed the death, and an Arab reporter identified the dead boy as 17-year-old Na'el <PERSON> Youssef </PERSON> <PERSON> Muhamad </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamaisi </PERSON>. Both spoke on condition of anonymity. A man in his 20s was treated and released for a bullet wound in the thigh after a demonstration in <LOCATION> Kalandia </LOCATION>, officials at <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s Mokassed Hospital said. The military spokeswoman said the army clamped a curfew on <LOCATION> Jenin </LOCATION> and on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> refugee camp of <LOCATION> Jelazoun </LOCATION> and town of <LOCATION> Kalkilya </LOCATION>, where there also were brief protests. In <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, an unidentified attacker hurled a firebomb at an army vehicle, the army spokeswoman said. She said the bomb damaged the car, but no one was injured. Since the anti-occupation unrest began in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> on Dec. 8, 215 Palestinians have been killed. Four Israelis also have died. On Friday, the Israeli general in charge of the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> promised to release dozens of Arab prisoners from areas where rioting has ceased and called on aspiring <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> leaders to cooperate with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities. Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Mordechai </PERSON> used <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s Arabic television services to appeal to <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>'s 650,000 residents in what appeared to be an attempt to reward residents for the relative calm of recent weeks. Also Friday, former U.N. Ambassador <PERSON> Benyamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Netanyahu </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> should deport hundreds of Arabs who instigate riots and have a policy of opening fire at people who throw rocks and firebombs. Israeli analyst <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben-Yishai </PERSON>, military correspondent for the <ORGANIZATION> Yedioth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ahronot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hebrew </ORGANIZATION> newspaper, said anti-Israeli attacks are now being carried out by small numbers of highly trained Palestinians. This is in contrast to the early months of the uprising, when hundreds of residents took part in frequent mass protests. <PERSON> Mordechai </PERSON>'s statements indicated <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities are ready to use a carrot as well as a stick approach, now that the massive violent demonstrations that characterized the first months of the uprising have waned. `` I have intentions to release dozens of prisoners, including administrative detainees, next week, and they will mostly be released if they are from places where there is quiet and security and where there has been a return to routine life,'' <PERSON> Mordechai </PERSON> said. Last month Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Amram </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitzna </PERSON>, who is in charge of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, released 89 Palestinian prisoners, a step military officials said was taken `` to contribute to restoring normal life to the area.''

 A man was arrested Saturday after what authorities described as a low-speed chase through <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Leroy </PERSON> <PERSON> Thayer </PERSON>, 34, was pursued through three states on suspicion of being involved in a hit-and-run accident in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and finally was caught here after being trapped on a dead-end street, said Sgt.

The sergeant said he expected <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> authorities to file charges later.

<HEAD>Defense Consultants Talk About Making Living The Honest Way</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 When <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Flax </PERSON> left the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> in 1969 after six years as the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s research and development chief, he asked the military's top lawyer what consulting work he could properly do on the outside and what he could not. `` I had a test when I was in the Pentagon which was ` I'm never going to do anything here I do n't want to see in writing on the front page tomorrow,''' Flax says. `` That's a pretty good test.'' Flax is a defense consultant, a member of a large and diversified profession that's become as indispensable to the marriage of government and industry as programs and spending. His line of work is technical consulting, which he says, is far removed from the world of bribery and corruption that's currently in the headlines. Others who are closer to that world are reluctant to talk about it on the record. `` You can make a good living very honestly in this business,'' one said. `` That's why I do n't understand these people.'' The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s view of some of `` these people'' was revealed in affidavits filed in court on June 14 to support <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> searches of the offices of consultants, contractors and a few <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> offices: `` The evidence developed in the investigation has shown that consultants often are the ones who: `` 1. obtain information and documents from government officials which should not be released to the companies and provide those items to the companies `` 2. speak to the government officials about doing something to benefit particular companies and `` 3. provide government officials with bribes and gratuities One type of consultant gives advice to companies on government relations, looking at their strategic plan for the next half dozen years and seeing whether that plan matches what the government needs. They advise on simple things. `` One time a company wanted to do a briefing for congressmen interested in a particular weapon,'' one consultant said. `` They wanted to have lunch, arranged in a downtown hotel miles from <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. I told them a congressman is n't going down to 14th Street, he does n't have time. If you are going to do a presentation, it's got to be within a few blocks of the Capitol.'' For such advice, he said, a consultant might earn $ 1,000 a day whenever he works. But he can be called on for far more difficult tasks. `` I've got a client who specializes in selling things overseas. He had a question as to policies in a particular area of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>, about how countries procure different things,'' said one consultant, who asked not to be named. `` I found a man in the Pentagon who is responsible for setting policy in that area and asked if I could bring that manufacturer in and let him clarify. In that case, it was a liaison function.'' In some cases, consultant is just another name for lobbyist. The military producer depends on contacts with the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> and with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The consultant gives strategic advice about whom to approach and how and when to make that approach. `` I never tell my client that I can get a congressman to take a stand to support their position one way or another,'' the consultant said. `` I say I can get you to present your side of the case.'' And, he added, `` I would never dream of going in to a congressman saying ` Support this as a favor to me.' I say, ` There are two sides to every story. There is a problem here between services. This is one possible solution. Let me give you this side.' And I always tell him what my client's interest is.'' Flax, an aeronautical engineer with a distinguished record, said, `` No one ever told me, ` Look, I have just been hired by company X to get them this contract.' It's never stated that way.'' Most former <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> hands who become consultants on the outside start with knowledge of who buys weapons for the government and what general programs are under way. They can keep up with changes just by reading newspapers and trade magazines. `` One little on-line squib that says <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Doaks </PERSON> has just been replaced by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> in that office is very meaningful to him,'' <PERSON> Flax </PERSON> said. `` He knows where <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> came from, knows what his character is, knows what the duties of the office are.'' `` You may have noticed, `` he added, `` that the consulting business is not limited to people who have left the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. People who have been in AID -LRB- the <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- know a lot about foreign countries and how to do business with them. Did n't <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> form a consulting firm and charge phenomenal fees?'' When he left the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Flax </PERSON> said, `` there was an absolute prohibition for one year on going back to the department I worked in with the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and having to do with any matter that involved contracts because I had held a position where I had some influence on virtually all contracts let in research and development.'' There was a lifetime ban, he said, on joining forces with anyone with whom he had negotiated because some contracts stretch over many years. As an example, <PERSON> Flax </PERSON> cited the Maverick missile, which still is in the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> arsenal. Now, 20 years later, he said, conflict-of-interest laws are much more restrictive. `` You have to be your own watchdog,'' <PERSON> Flax </PERSON> said. `` I'm very careful about what I do. I'm no longer constrained. I've been out of government for a long, long time. Still, I watch my actions.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Karoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> has appealed for talks with <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> following heightened tensions between the two <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> allies, a government newspaper reported today. In an interview with the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Magyar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hirlap </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> was quoted as stressing the `` political necessity and moral obligation'' for direct talks with <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> to find an end to the dispute. The newspaper said <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>, who also is premier, wants to go to <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> for talks but did not know when. <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> was quoted as saying there have been no contacts between he and <LOCATION> Romanian </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> but considered it important that <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> had called for a meeting between representatives of the two nations to improve relations. On Friday, the <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> passed a resolution accusing <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> of violating the human rights of ethnic Hungarians and other minorities in the neighboring East-bloc country. The action was taken at the end of a week of escalating tensions over <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s planned demolition of 7,000 villages with the residents to be resettled in `` agro-industrial'' centers. <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> newspapers said some Hungarians were being prevented from entering <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>. The resolution adopted by <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> with only one abstention said <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> is violating `` the fundamental human, national and nationalities-related rights.'' It called on <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> to re-examine its resettlement plan. There are about 1.7 million ethnic Hungarians living in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> and about 220,000 ethnic Germans as well as thousands of Serbs. Most of the Hungarians live in <LOCATION> Transylvania </LOCATION>, many in villages to be destroyed. <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> claims the resettlement will provide higher living standards and gain productive agricultural land where houses now stand. `` The annihilation of the values of the settlements doomed to destruction ... would mean an irreparable loss not only to the Hungarian, German and other ethnic minorities, but also to the Romanian people themselves,'' the resolution said. Earlier this week <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> expelled several Hungarian diplomats from an area inhabited by many ethnic Hungarians, closed a Hungarian consulate in <LOCATION> Cluj </LOCATION> and began turning back Hungarian tourists. <PERSON> Matyas </PERSON> <PERSON> Szueroes </PERSON>, the head of the foreign relations committee who presented the resolution to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, said <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s leadership would `` always be cooperating partners'' and was prepared to go ahead with preparations for a meeting of the two countries' premiers Hungarian newspapers quoted officials and travelers as saying Hungarians wishing to enter <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> were being turned back at the border. In some cases only those traveling through <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> to other destinations were allowed to cross into the country, the papers said. <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s decision to close the Hungarian consulate in <LOCATION> Cluj </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Traynsylvania </LOCATION> followed a demonstration by some 50,000 people who marched past the <ORGANIZATION> Romanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> to protest the resettlement plan.

 Mozambican rebels said Saturday they captured two army barracks and ambushed a military convoy, killing 38 Mozambican and five Zimbabwean soldiers. The <ORGANIZATION> Mozambique </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION>, known by the Portuguese acronym <ORGANIZATION> RENAMO </ORGANIZATION>, said its fighters seized the barracks in southern <LOCATION> Maputo </LOCATION> and central <LOCATION> Sofala </LOCATION> provinces. The rebels said they ambushed a convoy of 37 vehicles outside the capital, <LOCATION> Maputo </LOCATION>, and killed 10 Mozambican soldiers and captured 206 Soviet-made weapons. The statement, distributed in <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION>, said the fighting took place from Monday to Thursday. <ORGANIZATION> RENAMO </ORGANIZATION> also claimed 3,700 Zimbabwean soldiers had recently entered <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> and were deployed in the northern-central provinces of <LOCATION> Nampula </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zambezia </LOCATION> and Tete. The statement alleged that <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> government forces were `` losing control of the military situation.'' There was no independent confirmation of the rebel claims nor any indication of <ORGANIZATION> RENAMO </ORGANIZATION> casualties in the reported attacks. The rebels have been waging a hit-and-run guerrilla campaign since 1977 to topple the Marxist government. Troops from neighboring <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tanzania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION> fight in <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> alongside the army, mainly to protect vital transport routes and an oil pipeline from rebel attack.

<HEAD>Court Documents Reveal FBI Agents Not Fired For Breaking Laws</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents who broke drug and customs laws were reprimanded and suspended but not fired, according to court documents in a lawsuit filed by an agent who was dismissed. The previously confidential documents were obtained by an attorney for former agent <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rezza </PERSON>, who was fired three years ago after using federal money and a car in a gambling spree in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J </LOCATION>. The 22-year veteran filed suit last year contending that the action against him was overly harsh. Court files on the suit contain six disciplinary cases. In addition, government lawyers have conceded, without supplying files, the details of four other cases mentioned in <LOCATION> Rezza </LOCATION>'s complaint Allegations include reports of an agent who was suspended for 30 days after being arrested when he entered the country with marijuana and drug paraphernalia. There is also a report of a supervisor who was demoted, suspended for 45 days and put on probation for a year for placing bets with a bookie while supervising a gambling investigation of the same bookie. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> officials declined to comment on the documents. Spokesman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said the bureau does not comment on pending litigation. He added that disciplinary cases `` are confidential, an employer-employee administrative matter.'' In court documents, government lawyers have contended that <PERSON> Rezza </PERSON>'s dismissal _ regardless of his compulsive gambling problem or the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s record of discipline with other agents _ was an acceptable option. In a motion filed June 14, <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rezza </PERSON>'s attorney, said, `` The bureau's past practice is inconsistent with the categorical rule it now asserts. `` The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> disciplinary files produced in this case are replete with examples of agents who remained in service ... despite the use of drugs, misuse of credit cards, customs violations, illegal gambling, drunken driving, sexual misconduct, a hit and run accident and other illegal behavior.'' <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON> would not discuss the case, tentatively scheduled for trial in November. Some lawyers believe disparities in discipline are the result of an internal struggle between moderate elements in the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and conservative followers of the late <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON>. `` There is this gap between those elite elements who believe in a concept of government service and those elite elements who have more military mentality,'' said <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON>, one of the lawyers in a class-action discrimination suit filed last year by agent <PERSON> Bernardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> and now joined by 300 Hispanic <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents.

<HEAD>Staunch Conservative Dominates Supreme Court, With Some Surprises</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON>, as if to declare himself the man in charge, emerged as the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s dominant force in its just-completed 1987-88 term But to do so, the staunch conservative cast some surprising votes. They included trimming presidential power through an independent counsel law, making the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> more accountable in its employment practices and, in a key free-speech dispute, ruling for sex magazine publisher <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynt </PERSON> over evangelist <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> led the court in each case. He also wrote for the court when it upheld a municipal rent-control law and when it strengthened the right of prison inmates to see documents used in their prosecution. A year ago, <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> completed his first term as chief justice with the knowledge that his leadership had been blunted by the court's leading liberal, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>. In the most significant cases, <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> often had been among the dissenters as <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> led the court's majority. That trend was reversed, and <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> cast fewer dissenting votes during the 1987-88 term than any court member except Justice <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, a member of the court's floating center. But is <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON>, long the court's leading champion of the political right, moderating his views? `` He was carrying the flag -LRB- for conservatives -RRB- for a long time, and now he's chief,'' said <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> McGuigan </PERSON> of the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. `` Part of his job now is to count up five votes -LRB- needed for a majority -RRB- and to anticipate outcomes.'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Greve </PERSON> of the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> added, `` He may feel an obligation to be statesmanlike.'' Both men said Justice <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> now reigns as the court's most conservative member There is no doubt, however, that <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> remains a core conservative. For example, he wrote for a 5-4 majority when the court ruled that a law providing federal money to religious groups to discourage teen-agers from premartial sex does not necessarily violate the separation of church and state. From the first Monday in October when Justice <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> retired to Feb. 18, the court was one justice short. Justice <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s third choice to fill the vacancy, arrived only after the thwarted appointment of <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> and the aborted nomination of <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ginsburg </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> participated in 62 of the court's 139 signed decisions in a term that saw the court, with some notable exceptions, continue its conservative course. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s voting pattern already has liberal groups grumbling. In the future, his vote may give the court a solid conservative majority with those of <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON>, <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON>, Justice <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> and, in most instances, White. <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>'s most loyal ally remained Justice <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, but Justices <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> joined <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> far more often than they did <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> or <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON>. Here are summaries of the major rulings by the nation's highest court during its 1987-88 term:

<HEAD>Official Expresses Concern Over Influx Of Vietnamese</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A government official warned Saturday of a crisis if the influx of Vietnamese boat people to <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> does not stop. His statement came after 468 of the refugees arrived in one day. `` The situation in 10 days, if it goes on like this, will be critical,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Fortune </PERSON>, chief staff officer of the government <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, told <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> television. Vietnamese refugees have continued to flood this British colony, despite a tough new policy designed to keep them out. The government considers boat people arriving after June 15 to be illegal immigrants who will be kept in camps until <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> agrees to take them back. Only those fleeing religious or political persecution will be granted refugee status. <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> previously considered all boat people arriving from communist <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> to be refugees eligible for resettlement in other countries. Fortune expressed concern that facilities to house the growing number of boat people could fill up before new camps are opened. `` I would like to emphasize that we've got to get across to these people that they are going straight into detention,'' <PERSON> Fortune </PERSON> said. `` It's absolutely ridiculous to keep on coming here. They arrive, they go into detention and they will be eventually all sent back to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>,'' he added. The new policy was drafted as the number of boat people soared, to about 7,800 this year through mid-June, or about 12 times the number who arrived during the same period last year. During the first half of June alone, 2,850 Vietnamese boat people sailed into <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> waters. Arrivals during the second half of the month were just under 1,200, according to government statistics. On Friday, 468 boat people arrived. Another 172 sailed into the colony Saturday, according to the government. It was not immediately clear whether the most recent arrivals left <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> before the new policy was announced. Lord <PERSON> Glenarthur </PERSON>, British minister of state in charge of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> affairs, told a news conference Friday that it was an `` appalling indictment'' of the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> government that its people were willing to stay in crowded camps in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> rather than live in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. The government says the overwhelming majority of boat people are so-called `` economic migrants'' fleeing <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> in search of a better life. Immigration officers Wednesday began screening new arrivals to determine who was eligible for refugee status.

 A 12-year-old boy playing in a park dropped his realistic squirt gun and raised his arms when confronted by police who had received a call about a commando armed with a machine gun. A witness called police about noon Friday and reported seeing a man dressed in military fatigues carrying a gun in <LOCATION> Wickham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, police Lt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mott </PERSON> said. Eight police cars from <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> surrounded the park preparing to search for the gunman when <PERSON> Mott </PERSON> spotted the boy, who was wearing camouflage clothing, a backpack, a military belt and a helmet. `` As I got out of the car, he dropped the gun and put up his hands up,'' <PERSON> Mott </PERSON> said. `` That was the smart thing for him to do.'' `` When he saw the other cops pull up, he looked a little bewildered, a little nervous,'' <PERSON> Mott </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mott </PERSON>, who had not drawn his own handgun, said he realized the boy's gun _ resembling an <PERSON> Uzi </PERSON> submachine gun _ was a toy as soon as he saw it. After the commotion was over, <PERSON> Mott </PERSON> said they `` let the kid go play.''

<TEXT>
 The drought withering farm crops may be nourishing religious faith in rural communities in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, where parched lands threaten farm families' spirits as well as their livelihood. While praying for rain, members of small town congregations are being challenged to look deeper into their faith, some religious leaders say. Although a selection of churches around <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> reported no significant increase in Sunday attendance, special services to pray for rain have drawn well. `` People make more of an attempt for a deeper prayer life because of this, because it's a challenge,'' says the Rev. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Boeglin </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Celestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Dubois </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. `` I do n't think this is bringing people back to the church,'' said <PERSON> Boeglin </PERSON>, who is in charge of rural church affairs for 12 counties in the <LOCATION> Evansville </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diocese </LOCATION>. `` Most people on the land are already regular churchgoers because they know they're dependent on God for their success in agriculture. They have to have a bountiful rain that they ca n't control.'' One effort to exert influence has been the prayer services to plead for rain. A recent service in <LOCATION> Tipton </LOCATION>, a town between <LOCATION> Kokomo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Tipton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, drew about 200 people to a town park. `` We do n't even get that many people for our Good Friday service or our Thanksgiving service,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Jayna </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, the minister for youth and family education at <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. `` People are seeing a need to express their concern about the drought to God.'' A recent issue of a diocesan newspaper carried an article by <PERSON> Boeglin </PERSON> entitled, `` Should We Pray For Rain?'' `` I jokingly wrote in the article maybe God needs a hearing aid, or we're not praying loud enough,'' he said. The priest answered his own question by organizing a prayer meeting for Wednesday. `` We're not trying to wheel and deal with God. We ca n't say, ` OK, if we pray for rain, it's going to rain,' `` he said In the past, such prayers were a formal part of the church calendar, he said. During Rogation days, the three days before Ascension Day, congregations used to pray for good weather and bountiful crops. `` Now I see there is something in that tradition that we should keep going, because we see the serious need,'' he said. The drought highlights the Christian teaching that hope survives even in misery and suffering, he said. `` I think people need to hear the story <PERSON> God </PERSON> has not abandoned us because of the drought,'' he said. `` We will make it through. We will.''

<TEXT>
 The Arab uprising that has torn the Israeli-occupied territories for seven months is now interfering with one of the most sacred rites for Palestinian Moslems _ the hajj, or pilgrimage to <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION>. This month, as the world's Moslems travel to <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>'s holiest shrine in <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, only about 1,300 Palestinians from the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> will make the pilgrimage, less than a quarter the number who went last year. Palestinians say the sharp drop is due to the economic and psychological impact of the uprising and to tactics the Israelis are using to try to quell it. <PERSON> Adel </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sneineh </PERSON>, owner of an Islamic book store, said he decided not to go to <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> for fear of what might happen while he was gone. `` I would n't even be thinking about the hajj,'' he said. `` I'd be worried about whether my village was under curfew. Families with sons in jail were also reluctant to leave. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials say 5,000 Palestinians are imprisoned in connection with the uprising. More than 200 Palestinians and four Israelis have been killed in the violence. Palestinians are also faced with deep cuts in income this year as a result of dozens of anti-Israeli protest strikes, which have shortened their business hours, and orders from <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> leaders not to go to jobs in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The cheapest route to Mecca costs $ 740. This covers a bus ride from the Jordanian capital of <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Saudia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and includes hotels, but not food and other travel costs. It's an extra $ 30 if the bus is air conditioned. A travel agent specializing in hajj trips, who gave his name only as <PERSON> Abed </PERSON>, said some pilgrims were also having trouble getting Israeli exit permits because of unpaid taxes and age restrictions on Arab travelers. Withholding taxes is a chief weapon used by Palestinian underground leaders in their campaign of civil disobedience against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. One way <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> catches tax evaders is by checking records of any Palestinian who applies to go to <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. Under the age restrictions, Palestinian men aged 16 to 35 who go to <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> are ordered to stay there for nine months before returning. The measure was adopted several months ago to try to prevent messages from being passed to and from members of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Abed </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Rahman </PERSON>, 30, owner of a small cafe in <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> east </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, said this is preventing him and many others from making the monthlong hajj. `` I just want to make the pilgrimage. I do n't want to hang around <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION> almost a year,'' he said <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafowicz </PERSON>, spokesman for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> military government, said the age and tax measures were aimed at calming the violent uprising, not at holding back Moslems wishing to go to <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION>. `` The point is that everyone who wants to cross the bridge -LRB- to <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> -RRB- has to be checked about his tax payments,'' <PERSON> Rafowicz </PERSON> said. `` If there is no problem, he can cross the bridge.'' It is one of the basic tenets of Islamism that all Moslems go to <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> at least once, if they can afford it. This year, 1,300 Moslems will make the pilgrimage from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, according to <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Bayoud </PERSON>, head of the hajj department of the <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wakf </LOCATION>, or Moslem welfare society. He said 5,800 Moslems made the trip last year. By the Moslem lunar calendar, this year's hajj is expected to begin July 14. Buses begin the long trip to <LOCATION> Saudia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> this month. The high point of the pilgrimage, marking <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON>'s sacrifice of his son, should fall on about July 22 <PERSON> Samir </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Shuweiki </PERSON>, 31, a picture framer, feels so strongly about making this year's hajj that he paid for the trip even though he is kept from going by the government's age restrictions. He said has been going daily to the Israeli <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, but has not been granted an exit visa. `` This is harassment. Before the intefadeh -LRB- uprising -RRB-, I could have gotten the permit in one day,'' he said. <PERSON> Shuweiki </PERSON>, a father of five, spoke in his small shop in <LOCATION> Eizariyya </LOCATION>, an east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> suburb. On the walls were framed verses from the Koran, Islam's holy book. He said he would keep up his daily visits to the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> until the last moment. `` Why are the Israelis making these obstacles?'' <PERSON> Shuweiki </PERSON> asked. `` I want to go for prayer, not for politics.''

<HEAD>Dukakis, Bush: Looking for Votes In All The `Wrong' Places?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EVANS WITT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In recent days, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaigned in <LOCATION> Mississipi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, states that have backed a Democratic presidential hopeful only once in 28 years. This week, Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is going to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' hometown for a Greek Orthodox church dinner. No, these presidential candidates are n't just wasting their time, looking for votes in all the wrong places. These events are early feints in the general election campaign, a strategy called attacking your opponent's base. It is one piece of putting together the <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> puzzle to win 270 electoral votes and the White House on Nov. 8. `` If <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is tied down in places like <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, he's going to have a hard time doing what he needs to win the election,'' said Democratic pollster <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Mellman </PERSON>. `` It's a smart strategy for both sides,'' said <PERSON> Vince </PERSON> <PERSON> Breglio </PERSON>, a Republican campaign tactician. `` It's not defending your solid core vote. It's the marginal voters who are part of your base. They are part of the core, but not a dependable part.'' Of course, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> are looking for every possible vote in the fall. The theory behind the `` attacking the base'' strategy is straightforward: If a candidate must spend his time making certain the people who usually vote for his party will back him, he wo n't have time to win the swing voters who have been increasingly crucial to victory in this country For example, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has campaigned across the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and the farm belt in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, regions that have been very strong for the Republicans. Thus, if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> must defend his base of support in those areas, he will have less time to campaign in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> needs to do well. While such a strategy is used in all kinds of races, it is particularly important in a presidential campaign because of the <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> system. Winning the most votes does n't mean winning the White House. A candidate must win enough states to gain a majority of the 538 electoral votes at stake to succeed <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in 1989. Of course, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and their aides proclaim that they will battle for every state in the fall, taking nothing for granted and conceding nothing. `` It's not designed to make <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> pay attention to his base,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodin </PERSON> of the Thursday trip to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. `` It's an indication that we are not going to take anything for granted.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dach </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor's strength and campaigning all across the country makes it tough for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the GOP `` In their grand plan, they thought they did n't have to secure landing rights in big regions of the country,'' <PERSON> Dach </PERSON> said. `` Now, they're finding they have to lease apartments everywhere.'' The reality is that there are limited resources for a presidential campaign and limited time for a candidate's campaigning `` Once things have started to solidify, I'm sure the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign will sit down and make a careful assessment of where to concentrate the resources,'' <PERSON> Mellman </PERSON> said. The starting point of any <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> strategy _ and the `` attacking the base'' tactic _ is history. And history is on the side of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the Republicans. One way to look at electoral history is the percentage of the two-party vote for each candidate from 1952 through 1984. <PERSON> Mellman </PERSON> points out that <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> have averaged a majority of the vote in only six states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> over that period. That's a total of 52 electoral votes from <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. The Republicans have averaged at least 55 percent of the vote in 27 states through the same elections, for 208 electoral votes. Thus, Democrats would have to win 218 electoral votes among the 17 remaining states to add to their base to return to power in the White House. The <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> could hold onto its historic base and win the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> with only 62 electoral votes from the 278 available in those swing states. But <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aides say the appeal to history is a misleading one, saying the Republican spokesmen are `` trying to erect a historical barrier between <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and the voters.'' Democrats point to such states as <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> _ a traditionally <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> state _ where <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has a substantial lead in the polls. In addition, a purely regional strategy is tough to pull off, as differences between the regions shrink and the influence of national television coverage grows. `` The best thing to do is cherry-pick,'' <PERSON> Mellman </PERSON> says, `` taking a state here in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, and one there.'' With the national polls moving dramatically in recent weeks, <PERSON> Breglio </PERSON> agrees that the fall campaign is going to be `` hand-to-hand, state-by-state'' combat as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> try for the magic majority of 270 electoral votes.

 Indigant letters of support are pouring in from around the country for a man who lost a 50-foot oak tree when a neighbor cut it down to improve reception for his television satellite dish. `` This despicable act demands redress,'' a <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> man wrote to <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Marriner </PERSON>. `` This was a mean and horrible act,'' wrote a resident of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. `` To discourage others, I urge that you pursue steps to apply the most severe penalties against him which the law provides.'' <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, the neighbor who has admitted felling the 84-year-old tree, reportedly told police after the incident, `` Now I can get the Disney channel.'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> was charged with second-degree criminal mischief and third-degree criminal trespass and is due back in court July 22. He has offered <PERSON> Marriner </PERSON> $ 500 in compensation, but <PERSON> Marriner </PERSON> said he has n't accepted. `` The tree is irreplaceable,'' said <PERSON> Marriner </PERSON>, who discovered the felled tree on June 12. He said he got one estimate of more than $ 9,000 to remove and replace it, along with others that were damaged by the falling oak. A <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> man suggested what he thought would be fair punishment. `` I have no television in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and am not particularly fond of the dishes that have ruined many a backyard,'' the man wrote. `` Proper retribution, I think, would be to revoke <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s right to have a satellite dish.'' Calls to <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s home for comment Saturday were answered by a machine.

 Americans in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> celebrated Independence Day on Saturday with dragon dances, Chinese acrobats, an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> band and 3,000 McDonald's Big Macs. More than 1,500 Americans living in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, from <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> to the far northwestern <LOCATION> Xinjiang </LOCATION> province, gathered at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy in the capital. Chinese guards were posted outside the embassy compound, and a metal detector was set up at the main entrance. Authorities last month warned Americans in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> that they might be the target of terrorists from another country. The third country was never identified, and the warning was eventually lifted. `` We're as safe as in Main Street, <LOCATION> U.S.A. </LOCATION>,'' said an embassy official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Each year for the past five years, <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> has flown in thousands of Big Macs for the Fourth of July. But this year, the McDonald's monopoly over the embassy party was broken by <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fried </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicken </ORGANIZATION>, which opened its largest restaurant in the world here in the fall. <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> Fried Chicken donated 1,000 meals for the celebration, while 14 McDonald's employees from <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> flipped 3,000 patties for Americans desperate for a taste of Big Macs. The festivities started with an afternoon parade by 70 children riding bicycles festooned with red, white, and blue streamers or on roller skates. Ambassador <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Lord </PERSON>, dressed as a cowboy in a white vest, red shirt and straw hat, called on Americans to exercise their right to vote in this fall's presidential elections. `` There is one important, almost mystical right that Americans carry wherever our roads may lead. The right to vote,'' he said. `` I encourage you to vote ... There is nothing quite like this American expression of will.'' Lord's 10-minute speech ended in a deafening roar of firecrackers. Two teams of dragon dancers, accompanied by clanging cymbals, then took over the show. Next came the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> pop band, `` Spectrum.'' The band was flown in from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for the occasion. Filling the breaks in the band's performance were a lip-sync contest, a raffle and a performance by a children's chorus from <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. Ticket sales covered the cost of the $ 41,000 event, with a $ 20 admission for students, teachers and embassy staff, and $ 30 for everyone else.

 A sudden spate of black bear sightings at parks, fairgrounds, highways, back yards and _ naturally _ honey bee hives has residents of the western part of the state wondering if there is a bear boom. The bear population has indeed gone up, say wildlife officials. But the problem comes more from a people boom in the state's western hills, so the two populations, human and ursine, see each other more often `` It is a case of people going into a bear's back yard,'' said <PERSON> Ellie </PERSON> <PERSON> Horwitz </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the state Division of Fisheries and Wildlife. `` They are farming, putting up bee hives, and are not taking into consideration that the bears are attracted to these things. The bears are opportunists and will take advantage of whatever is easiest and convenient.'' Authorities have n't released any figures on the number of bears sighted in residential areas, but <PERSON> Horwitz </PERSON> said, `` None of the bears we have been made aware of are of any danger to the community.'' No injuries to either the bears or startled humans have been reported. While people scurry for cameras and shelter, the usually docile black bears head back to the woods. `` Black bears are relatively small and unaggressive,'' said <PERSON> Horwitz </PERSON>. `` Some people will describe them as looking like fat dogs. But they really do n't look like dogs at all. A well-fed bear will have a round body and a small head with an elongated face.'' `` A black bear that gets up to 400 pounds in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> is considered to be a very large bear, although in other areas they may get up to 600 pounds,'' she said. By contrast, grizzly bears in the West can reach 1,500 pounds. Black bears can be aggressive in some circumstances. At <LOCATION> Vail </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, one chased a 14-year-old boy last weekend after the youth photographed the animal. <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> wildlife officials have set bear traps around the posh resort because as many as eight bears have been feasting on trash dumps. In <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, an estimated 500 bears roam the 400-square-mile area between the <LOCATION> Berkshire </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> north of the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Turnpike </LOCATION> _ the general area where the sightings have been reported. In the mid-1970s, it was thought only 100 bears lived in the state. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON>, chief of police at Look Memorial Park, says he can no longer hike on half the trails he frequented as a boy because so many vacation and summer homes have been built. `` Many of the areas are taken up with development. You can still walk through them, but you could be considered a trespasser,'' he said. `` There are some very exclusive and secluded developments going up.'' <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> McCallum </PERSON>, assistant director of the state wildlife agency, said the number of sightings indicates two problems: a loss of natural habitat for the bears due to increased residential development and a possible change in people's attitudes toward the animals. `` When people build a house in the middle of the woods, sometimes up to a quarter-mile in from the road, the bears are not going to move out,'' he said. `` Most people like bears. They are fascinated by them,'' <PERSON> McCallum </PERSON> said. `` But when so many people move from urban areas to rural areas and bring their urban attitudes, treating the wild animals as pets, managing the wildlife population becomes very difficult.'' At the same time, he said, farmers who claim to have lost crops or livestock to bears tend to view the animals as pests. Farmers in <LOCATION> Franklin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> have asked for an extension on the one-week bear hunting season in September. In 1987, 21 of the 34 bears shot in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> were taken in or around corn fields, <PERSON> McCallum </PERSON> said.

 About 50,000 refugees herding flocks of camels and goats have fled the civil war in neighboring <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION> and sought sanctuary in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, officials said Saturday. Relief workers, speaking on condition of anonymity, said 60,000 others were massed on the northwestern border waiting to cross into <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> if the conflict continues between the <ORGANIZATION> Somali </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> rebels and government forces. Aid officials said the influx was placing an added strain on <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s limited resources. The country has about 3 million starving people, and rebels are fighting Ethiopian forces in civil wars in the northern provinces of Tigre and <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION>. The refugees are being housed in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> at camps run jointly by the Marxist government and the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> for Refugees. Relief officials said the refugees claimed persecution by President <PERSON> Siad </PERSON> <PERSON> Barre </PERSON>'s government. <PERSON> Barre </PERSON> seized power in a 1969 coup. Since 1977, he has been a staunch ally of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Shultz Preaches Democracy In Central America</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Sounding much like the college professor he once was, Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> took a back-to-basics message to four friendly <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> countries last week: democracy works, Marxism does n't. During visits to <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> repeated that theme time and again, urging the countries and their peoples to stay on their democratic course and to reject Nicaraguan-style Marxism. As <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> saw it, the four democracies, three of which are relative newborns, now boast of economic growth, declining inflation and improved social services. In contrast, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said, living standards in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> have dropped by two-thirds over the past four months, inflation is `` sure to exceed 2,000 per cent this year, and tens of thousands of workers are paid less than the cost of subsistence.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s optimistic appraisal of the four democracies seemed excessive to some analysts. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> himself saw some of the despair still plaguing the region, particularly on Thursday as he raced from <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and back to <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, a country where fully half the labor force is unable to find adequate employment, armed rebellion continues, and human rights abuses, after a long period of decline, are now on the increase. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> called democracy the `` way of the future'' in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> but many Salvadorans obviously are not convinced. The atmosphere was far more tranquil in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, but there <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> could see the fruits of an appalling housing shortage: people by the thousands living in shelters consisting of little more than sheets of corrugated metal. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s point, though, was that <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s democracies, for all their problems, are moving ahead, while <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s living standards continue to retrogress. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> did his best to deflect attention during his trip from the pending debate in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> over aid to the Nicaraguan Contras. But the Contras, normally a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ally, upset this design after a meeting late Thursday night with <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> at his hotel in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. With the stall in efforts to reach peace between the Contras and the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>, the rebels offered tantalizing details of a new aid strategy they are developing in cooperation with the administration and their supporters on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. Administration officials said only four minutes of the hour-long session was devoted to the possibility of resuming military aid to the Contras. If that's true, it may have been an important four minutes, given the divisiveness of Contra aid as an election year campaign issue. The Contras, now limited to a $ 17 million package of humanitarian aid and deprived of military aid since late February, have little support among liberals. Democratic front runner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has said that lethal aid to the rebels is illegal. <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON>, a Contra directorate member, said the morning after the rebels' meeting with <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> that the secretary was `` very enthusiastic'' about a new <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> aid proposal that was discussed. <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> said a $ 30 million aid package being considered by the administration, of which perhaps $ 7 million would be spent as military aid if <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, failed to fulfill promises of democratic reform. The night before, <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON>, another <LOCATION> Contra </LOCATION> leader, had talked of a revolutionary new wrinkle in the Contra aid debate. He said that as a sweetener for the Sandinistas, they would receive economic aid if they implemented democratic reform. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> apparently hopes that with so many Nicaraguan lives at risk because of economic deprivation, the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> may be ready to rethink their strategy on how their society should be constructed. He also believes the more military and diplomatic pressure is placed on the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>, the more the rethinking process will be accelerated.

<TEXT>
 The slayings of three men and a child in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> are the latest in a series of deaths and disappearances believed linked to a violent sect of polygamists still faithful to a vengeful patriarch who died seven years ago. Internal violence has long marked the cult of <PERSON> Ervil </PERSON> <PERSON> LeBaron </PERSON>, a self-proclaimed prophet whose quest for power and teaching of blood atonement launched a 22-year reign of terror among Mormon fundamentalists. The killings in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, which police suspect are the work of three of <PERSON> LeBaron </PERSON>'s sons, bring to 18 the number of <PERSON> LeBaron </PERSON>'s former disciples who have died or disappeared over the past two decades. In <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> LeBaron </PERSON> was convicted of masterminding the 1977 murder of rival polygamist leader <PERSON> Rulon </PERSON> <PERSON> Allred </PERSON>, members of other polygamist groups are horrified at the bloodshed, a professor said. `` They're disgusted, and some of them are a bit frightened,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, who has studied polygamist groups. `` Most of them are peaceful and mostly law-abiding, except for the polygamy, of course.'' <PERSON> LeBaron </PERSON>'s Church of the Lamb of God is but one of many groups who advocate a return to polygamy, which was taught by <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, founder of the Church of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> of Latter-day <ORGANIZATION> Saints </ORGANIZATION>. The Utah-based church banned polygamy in 1890 and excommunicates those who practice it. Nevertheless, an estimated 20,000 to 30,000 people are believed to live in polygamist families. At the heart of the struggle may be the fundamentalist belief that God will send `` one mighty and strong'' to reform the <ORGANIZATION> Mormon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, by violence, if necessary. `` That has been the thing that has been a deluding scripture for all these splinter group leaders for the past 100 years,'' <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said. `` It leads to this egomaniacal approach that leads to continual splintering. `` This process has been going on for a long time and undoubtedly will continue to do so,'' he said. Among others knowledgeable about the clan, there is little surprise that the young LeBarons are suspects in the June 27 killings of <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Marston </PERSON>, 32, in the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Irving </LOCATION>, and brothers <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Chynoweth </PERSON>, 36, <PERSON> Duane </PERSON> <PERSON> Chynoweth </PERSON>, 31, and <PERSON> Duane </PERSON>'s 8-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> <PERSON> Marston </PERSON> was a stepson of <PERSON> LeBaron </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Chynoweth </PERSON> was married to <PERSON> LeBaron </PERSON>'s daughter, <PERSON> Lillian </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> detectives are seeking LeBaron's sons, <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON>, 28; <PERSON> Heber </PERSON>, 27; and <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON>, 20, for questioning. `` I would think they certainly would be considered prime suspects, inasmuch as since <PERSON> Ervil </PERSON> died, there have been these threats made to other former members of the LeBaron organization,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Murray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Lt. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON>, the chief investigator in <PERSON> Allred </PERSON>'s slaying. <PERSON> LeBaron </PERSON> died of a heart attack at <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> State Prison in 1981. But <PERSON> Lillian </PERSON> <PERSON> Chynoweth </PERSON> has said that he targeted a number of people for death for being unfaithful to his teachings. Those who have died or vanished since 1966 have included LeBaron followers, brothers, nephews, wives, critics and rivals. <PERSON> Marston </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Chynoweth </PERSON> were acquitted of charges in the Allred slaying, and <PERSON> Marston </PERSON> also was acquitted in the 1975 death of <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Simons </PERSON>, another polygamist who challenged <PERSON> LeBaron </PERSON>. In October 1987, <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>, who had split with the LeBaron group and moved his polygamous family to <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, was fatally shot at a deer-hunting camp in southeastern <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>. <PERSON> LeBaron </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> both claimed to be the `` one mighty and strong,'' as did <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Evoniuk </PERSON>, who founded his own church after <PERSON> LeBaron </PERSON>'s death and vanished from <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, in May 1987. <PERSON> Rena </PERSON> <PERSON> Chynoweth </PERSON>, a widow of <PERSON> Ervil </PERSON> <PERSON> LeBaron </PERSON> and sister of the slain <PERSON> Chynoweth </PERSON> brothers who has gone into hiding since her brothers' deaths, considers the <PERSON> LeBaron </PERSON> sons to be seriously unbalanced, said her attorney, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> She believes she is also on <PERSON> LeBaron </PERSON>'s `` hit list,'' said <PERSON> O'Connell </PERSON>. `` The Chynoweths and <PERSON> Marston </PERSON> all were raised in the church, as were these boys who are running around now,'' he said. `` But they were intelligent, rational people. They were involved in some things, but as time went on, they could see that it just was n't making sense and they got out,'' <PERSON> O'Connell </PERSON> said.

 A car plowed into a group of 87 West Germans walking to a religious festival, killing a policeman escorting them and injuring 12 of the pilgrims, officials said Saturday. The accident occurred late Friday near <LOCATION> Weiden </LOCATION>, about 45 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Nuremberg </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Bavaria </LOCATION> state. The Roman Catholic pilgrims were walking along the side of a road, en route to nearby <LOCATION> Amberg </LOCATION> for a religious festival Saturday, police said. Police said a 25-year-old man lost control of his vehicle and plowed into the group. A 39-year-old policeman was killed, and some of the pilgrims suffered serious injuries, police said. The pilgrims had taken many precautions to ensure their safety along their walk, police said, including wearing fluorescent vests and carrying blinking lights. The police escort was also intended to ensure their safety. Police were trying to track down two cars that passed the group seconds before the accident. Those two automobiles apparently were traveling on the wrong side of the road after passing the pilgrims and may have caused the man to lose control of his car, police said.

 In a written Fourth of July message, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said that each celebration of the holiday marking the signing of the Declaration of Independence stirs `` the pure patriotism of childhood.'' `` With each flag, with each parade and picnic and burst of fireworks, we ca n't help but recall the first stirrings of our deep love for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' the president said. `` No matter how many Fourths we Americans have seen, every new one revives in our hearts the pure patriotism of childhood.'' The full text of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s message is as follows: `` The Fourth of July is much more than a date on the calendar _ it is celebrated here in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and recognized around the world, as a turning point in history. No matter how many Fourths we Americans have seen, every new one revives in our hearts the pure patriotism of childhood. With each flag, with each parade and picnic and burst of fireworks, we ca n't help but recall the first stirrings of our deep love for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` This year, on our nation's 212th birthday, we recall another special anniversary, the bicentennial of our first Independence Day under our newly ratified Constitution. In his diary entry for that date, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Quincy </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> recorded how the news of the latest state ratification was received in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>: ` -LRB- I -RRB- mmediately the bells were set to ringing, and the guns to firing again, without any mercy, and continued all the remainder of the afternoon.' For two centuries now, the Constitution whose birth these patriots so exuberantly hailed has endured, ensuring our liberty and preserving this great Republic. `` The passage of time has only brought us even more reason to celebrate. Our founders marked the Fourth of July, uncertain that the union would be formed; our ancestors at the time of the Civil War marked it as well, uncertain that the union would survive, and our parents and grandparents marked it, uncertain that it would withstand the ravages of global conflict. We can rejoice _ and be grateful to God _ that peace and prosperity, the hope of every generation, reign for us on this July 4, 1988. `` To all my fellow Americans, happy Fourth of July.''

 A jury today ordered that <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Heidnik </PERSON> die in the electric chair for killing two of six women he imprisoned in a basement torture chamber. Jurors, who on Friday convicted <PERSON> Heidnik </PERSON> of first-degree murder in the slayings of <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON> and <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Dudley </PERSON>, deliberated about 90 minutes before reaching a verdict on a sentence. The sentence will automatically be reviewed by the <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. During a sentencing hearing today, a prosecutor had asked the jurors to impose the death sentence. They could have sentenced <PERSON> Heidnik </PERSON> to life in prison. `` This man is legally sane and he knew what he was doing and he did it with torture,'' Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON> told jurors, who could have given <PERSON> Heidnik </PERSON> a life sentence. `` Death is the correct sentence,'' <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Heidnik </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Peruto </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, appealed to the jurors to consider that <PERSON> Heidnik </PERSON> suffers from a severe mental disease. <PERSON> Heidnik </PERSON> did not testify at the sentencing hearing. `` I just hope you do the right thing,'' <PERSON> Peruto </PERSON> said after being directed by Common Pleas Judge <PERSON> Lynne </PERSON> <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> not to rehash previous testimony from the trial, which featured survivors' tales of cannibalism and sadism. The jury on Friday rejected <PERSON> Heidnik </PERSON>'s insanity defense, convicting him of two counts of first-degree murder, six charges of kidnapping, five of rape, four of aggravated assault and one of involuntary deviate sexual intercourse. <PERSON> Peruto </PERSON> said Friday his client expects the death penalty and wants no appeal. `` Do n't bother,'' Peruto quoted <PERSON> Heidnik </PERSON> as saying. `` Let's get it over with.'' <PERSON> Heidnik </PERSON>, 44, was accused of butchering the body of one woman he had abducted and then feeding some of her cooked flesh to four other abducted women he imprisoned in his <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> basement, which was labeled a `` house of horrors'' during the trial. Prosecutors say he raped the women repeatedly in hopes of breeding `` a superior race'' between November 1986 and his arrest in March 1987. The four survivors testified at his trial. <PERSON> Heidnik </PERSON>'s attorney conceded that his client committed the crimes, but said he was mentally ill and was not aware of what he was doing. If the jurors fail to agree on a sentence on the two murder counts, the judge must automatically impose a life in prison term. The judge will impose a sentence on the other charges later. The jurors, chosen in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> because of pretrial publicity here over the bizarre case, received the case Wednesday and, over three days, spent nearly 18 hours before reaching their unanimous decision. There was one verdict of innocent, on a charge of involuntary deviate sexual intercourse with a prostitute who had escaped <PERSON> Heidnik </PERSON>'s house in March 1987 and brought police to the rescue of the other three chained women. `` Thank God it was guilty of first-degree,'' said <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Lomax </PERSON>, sister of <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON>, whose body was sawed apart in <PERSON> Heidnik </PERSON>'s house after she died while chained to a pipe, according to police Some of her remains were fed to other captives. `` He deserved, ` Guilty, guilty, guilty.' Now I'm hoping for the death penalty,'' Ms. <PERSON> Lomax </PERSON> said. `` That was a brutal way for my sister to die, tortured. Nobody deserves to die like that.'' <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Dudley </PERSON> said <PERSON> Heidnik </PERSON> `` got what he deserved'' for electrocuting <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Dudley </PERSON>, her sister, by touching live wires to her chains while she stood in a water-filled basement pit. Her body was found in a wooded area in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. `` Now I hope he gets the chair and <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> can rest in peace,'' Ms. <PERSON> Dudley </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Peruto </PERSON> called the verdict `` a big letdown'' because he had thought his insanity defense had made an impact on the jurors. <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON> was elated and called it `` a just decision.'' In closing arguments, <PERSON> Peruto </PERSON> told jurors <PERSON> Heidnik </PERSON> was a `` fruitcake'' who suffered from schizophrenia, a mental illness first diagnosed in 1963 and for which he was discharged from the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. He contended <PERSON> Heidnik </PERSON> suffered from delusions and `` did n't realize the quality of his acts. <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON> insisted that <PERSON> Heidnik </PERSON> was faking the illness. <PERSON> Peruto </PERSON> had claimed <PERSON> Heidnik </PERSON> was treated with LSD while a hospital patient during <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> service in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in 1962, but said he was unable to obtain hospital records. <PERSON> Heidnik </PERSON> later founded a church in which he proclaimed himself a bishop, and allegedly used contributions to the church to play the stock market. His stock transactions were so successful that he amassed more than $ 500,000. Despite his wealth, <PERSON> Heidnik </PERSON> lived in a poor neighborhood and appeared in court in tattered clothes.

<TEXT>
 Ten years ago, <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Henschel </PERSON> was atop the <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> farming industry after he and his wife were selected one of <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>'s outstanding young farm couples. But after a decade of price fluctuation, market instability and this year's devastating drought, the dairy farmer has second thoughts about the career he chose when he was a brash 20-year-old. `` Well, I guess it is n't as good as I thought it would be,'' he said Friday. `` When I started in this I thought by the time I got to be 40 _ I'm 43 right now _ I would n't have to worry about my investments in farming. `` I just have n't got ahead like I thought I would. Nowadays, farmers ca n't get ahead as easy.'' <PERSON> Henschel </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Allis </PERSON>, operate a 350-acre farm about two miles outside this northeastern <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> community. They own about 200 head of cattle, including 90 milking cows. Just 10 years after he was selected the area's top young farmer by the <ORGANIZATION> Mid-States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Region </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Milk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Producers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Henschel </PERSON>'s fortunes have changed. An eight-week drought has parched his first two hay crops and left him without enough feed for his Holsteins. He recently sold 11 cows because he could no longer feed them and more could be sold later if his third hay crop is not productive. `` I've never seen it this dry as long as I've been farming,'' he said. `` Our second -LRB- hay -RRB- crop, there's not much there so we'll be cutting soon and looking to get a third crop in. `` But without a couple of good rains, there wo n't be much there either.'' The drought is just one of several factors that have forced hundreds of <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> farmers into bankruptcy, foreclosure, selling out, or retirement in the last decade. `` I think the prices and the cost of equipment compared to what you get for your products is the main reason,'' <PERSON> Henschel </PERSON> said. He said the price per hundredweight of milk, about 12 gallons, has dropped in the last five years from $ 13 to $ 10.50. During the same time, equipment and overhead costs have risen, he said. Had it not been for the drought, farmers were expecting a year of recovery after three to five years of financial trouble, `` but the way things are going ... I do n't see how we can come out of it,'' he said. <PERSON> Henschel </PERSON> began farming independently at age 20 after growing up on his father's farm. He began by forming a partnership with his brother, in which the two shared machinery and manpower. Since then, <PERSON> Henschel </PERSON> has taken over his father's farm and expanded it. During his award-winning year in 1978, he produced about 1,446,320 pounds of milk and 52,564 pounds of butter from 80 cows. This year he expects to produce 1,710,000 pounds of milk and 62,100 pounds butter from 90 cows. But much more than production has changed over the last 10 years. <PERSON> Henschel </PERSON>'s father died and he was forced to let go of his longtime hired hand. <PERSON> Henschel </PERSON> must now rely on his wife, daughter, son-in-law, and two teen-age sons for help. `` Since then, farming's gotten tighter and it's come to where you ca n't afford to hire a full-time farmhand any longer,'' he explained.

 Eight tons of <ORGANIZATION> TNT </ORGANIZATION> exploded at an anti-aircraft base near the eastern city of <LOCATION> Khabarovsk </LOCATION>, smashing windows in almost 200 homes and injuring some people, the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said Saturday. `` There were no deaths, but there are injuries. Basically, people received cuts from glass broken out of window frames by the force of the blast,'' <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Akhromeyev </PERSON>, the chief of the Soviet military staff, told the officials government newspaper. It did not say how many people were hurt. <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said the explosion took place late on the evening of June 29 at an anti-aircraft base eight kilometers -LRB- five miles -RRB- south of <LOCATION> Khabarovsk </LOCATION>, a city of about 600,000 people located just north of the Chinese border. Windows were shattered in almost 200 homes of an outlying region of <LOCATION> Kabarovsk </LOCATION>. A poultry-processing factory, two hospitals, 38 stores and several schools and kindergartens also were damaged, the newspaper said. The Soviet military was helping repair the damage, and a special commission was appointed to investigate the blast, it said. The cause had not yet been determined, it said.

<HEAD>Catamaran Fleet Opens Up Thames to Commuter Traffic</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A fleet of jet-powered catamarans has opened the British capital's last uncrowded thoroughfare _ the <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Thames </LOCATION> _ to commuter traffic. `` There's nothing else like this: an intensive river shuttle service in the center of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Mabbott </PERSON>, deputy managing director of <ORGANIZATION> Thames </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>. Since the service's debut June 1, the firm's three boats have cruised past cars on choked streets to ferry about 600 passengers a day from central <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to the booming <LOCATION> Docklands </LOCATION> area. The catamarans _ twin-hulled boats that can reach speeds of about 28 mph _ carry up to 62 passengers and are powered by two turbo-charged <ORGANIZATION> Volvo </ORGANIZATION> jet engines. One leaves Charing Cross Pier in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s West End every 15 minutes from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. for a five-mile journey to the Isle of Dogs, heart of the sprawling Docklands redevelopment area, where decrepit warehouses are being turned into modern residential and light industry complexes. The full trip with two stops takes 20 minutes. A similar journey on the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> Underground subway takes up to 30 minutes, <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> spokesmen said. One big difference is the price. The subway trip costs 80 pence, or $ 1.36, each way. The catamaran ride costs 4 pounds, or $ 7.20, each way. `` There's an element to competing with all forms of transport,'' <PERSON> Mabbott </PERSON> said, `` but what we're looking to provide is service to places the Underground, buses and cars do n't get to easily.'' Traditional ferries have not operated with the speed or frequency of the Thames Line catamarans, <PERSON> Mabbott </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Thames </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> was established with $ 8.1 million in 1986 to simultaneously develop property in the Docklands and create a river shuttle for the growing number of people living and working there. <PERSON> Mabbott </PERSON> said Thames Line's operating costs for June broke even at $ 108,600 to $ 126,700, with the boats carrying an average of five passengers per trip. He expects 80 percent of the passengers to be commuters or business people with an interest in the Docklands, and 20 percent tourists. Passengers last week gave Thames Line generally favorable reviews, but one said some problems still need working out. <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Mackay </PERSON>, 45, a civil engineer from the northern <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Rickmansworth </LOCATION>, complained his boat left <ORGANIZATION> Charing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pier </ORGANIZATION> 20 minutes late. `` They need to improve their scheduling if business people are going to use it,'' he said. <PERSON> Rhonda </PERSON> <PERSON> Kufluk </PERSON>, 36, a property developer, lives in the Docklands and uses the service daily. `` It's wonderful,'' she said. `` I hate taxi cabs. The Tube -LRB- subway -RRB- tends to be overcrowded and uncomfortable.'' Thames Line plans to put four more boats in operation by October and extend its service farther east past <ORGANIZATION> Charing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION> Chelsea </LOCATION> and farther west to <LOCATION> Greenland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pier </LOCATION> in the Docklands, <PERSON> Mabbott </PERSON> said.

 Miss <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is not supposed to portray the innocent bathing beauty anymore _ she's a career woman who is educated and articulate, and she may not even be a virgin, says the pageant's new director. Miss <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> contestants, says <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Horn </PERSON>, are human beings living in a very liberal 20th century. `` They sweat. They're nervous, they've made mistakes. They may not all be virgins. I do n't know whether they are or not. Who cares?'' <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> says. `` I'm sure that if we found out 25 or 30 years ago that a girl lived with somebody or had intercourse, she would n't make the morals clause.'' `` Today? Come on!'' he says with a laugh. In an interview last week, <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> described what could become sweeping changes to assure that the public never again views <LOCATION> Miss </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> as just a beauty queen. The <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> attorney, who has volunteered with the pageant for the past 25 years, replaced <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Marks </PERSON> as director of the 68-year-old contest, ending Marks' 35-year reign. The biggest challenge for pageant directors always has been attracting television viewers in the same age group as the contestants. The contest has a loyal following of older women and young starry-eyed girls, but young college and career women often spurn the event as old-fashioned, <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> said. This year's pageant will emphasize the contestants' backgrounds much more, he said. `` These women are interesting individuals,'' <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> said. `` They're thinking human beings. You can get any one of them in an intense conversation. And for the most part, they're pretty courageous kids to put themselves on the line for some specific goal, whether it's for a scholarship or displaying their derriere _ which is probably not the case anymore.'' Some standards still apply, however. <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> said former Miss America <PERSON> Vanessa </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> had to be dethroned after nude photographs were published in order to protect the integrity of a pageant that still wants young girls to dream about the crown. The pageant also is not seeking only drop-dead-gorgeous contestants. `` If a young woman considered herself to be the ugliest person in the world, she could still enter a local pageant,'' <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> said. `` Those who enter these contests enter because they are confident enough of their beauty. So what is defined as ` beauty' is self-limiting by the contestants.'' An updated stage production is planned as a way to reshape the contest's image. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> and Emmy award-winning Broadway producer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Pippin </PERSON> will be music director for this year's show, replacing <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Edna </PERSON> <PERSON> Osser </PERSON>, who have handled the productions for the past 35 years. `` They did a great job, but there comes a time when you've got to change things,'' <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> said. `` The music has to be more upbeat. We do n't want to go into hard rock, but we are dealing with young people so we do n't want to turn them off.'' Another change aimed at luring more viewers will be bringing in celebrity judges on the final night of the pageant to pick from the top 10 contestants, <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> said. This year's pageant will be held Sept. 10, a week earlier than usual to accommodate <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s coverage of the Olympic games. <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> said that next year the pageant might be moved from its traditional Saturday night television slot, aired live from 10 p.m. to midnight. `` Some sponsors feel we can do better in prime time, like maybe Sunday or Monday evening,'' he said. <PERSON> Horn </PERSON>'s most controversial change might be in the way he will revise seating in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s Convention Center. Many of the reserved boxes near the runway have been passed down among generations of Miss <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> supporters, but now will be given to the pageant's eight sponsors for their executives. Some of the resort's casinos have been offered a chance to buy boxes _ at a hefty premium _ for their high rollers. <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> denies that the pageant has become too commercial. `` Just because someone has been sitting in a box for 30 years,'' he said, `` does not mean they should be filling a box that can be filled more financially in order to keep the pageant here in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>.''

 A car bomb exploded today outside a crowded <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> sports stadium, killing at least two people and injuring 26, police said. The blast occurred on a street alongside <LOCATION> Ellis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> stadium minutes after the end of the rugby match between <LOCATION> Transvaal </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, said police spokesman <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Louw </PERSON>. <PERSON> Louw </PERSON> said the two men killed were white. Among the injured, 23 are white, two are black and one is Asian, <PERSON> Louw </PERSON> said. The stadium seats about 75,000 people and is the largest sporting facility in the <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> area. The attendance figure was not immediately available, but Saturday afternoon matches generally attract at least 25,000 fans. Sportswriters covering the match said they saw flames leaping 60 yards into the air following the explosion, the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> reported. They said the blast occurred just outside an entrance gate to the stadium, <ORGANIZATION> SAPA </ORGANIZATION> said. Several surrounding buildings in the downtown area were set ablaze, but were extinguished by firemen within several minutes, witnesses said. Metal from the car that exploded was found up to 200 yards away from the blast, witnesses added. Several additional cars also were damaged they said. Police immediately blocked off the area and began checking nearby parked cars for additional explosives. Rugby is the most popular team sport among white South Africans, and tens of thousands of whites regularly attend weekend matches at <LOCATION> Ellis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>. The bombing was the latest in a recent series of attacks aimed at civilian targets. There have been more than 90 bombings since the government declared a natinwide state of emergency in June 1986, including some 25 this year. Police have blamed virtually all the attacks on the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla group, the main black organization attempting to overthrow the white-led government. The group, based in <LOCATION> Lusaka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>, seldom confirms or denies involvement in specific attacks. However, recent statements by <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> leaders have suggested that the organization approves of attacks on civilian targets. On Thursday, 13 whites and one black were hurt by a bomb that exploded outside a fast food restaurant in a <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> shopping center at the Poyntons Building, which houses the air force and prison service headquarters on upper floors. Hospital officials said none was hurt seriously. Two of the injured people were children. The country is run under a system of apartheid, a policy of segregation that preserves power and privilege for <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s 5 million whites and denies rights and a voice in national affairs to its 26 million blacks. On Friday, the government proposed tough measures to enforce residential segregation, and critics said it could mean mass eviction of blacks from white areas. The bills are to be debated in August. The government has not strictly enforced the 35-year-old act Group Areas Act in recent years, which restricts blacks to certain areas. The proposed amendment to the act calls for the hiring of inspectors to check violations of the law. It would make it easier for authorities to confiscate property and to evict and prosecute people living in areas not designated for their race group. On June 10, President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> extended for a third year the country's state of emergency.

<HEAD>Controversial Dukakis Prison Siting Enters Presidential Politics</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW BRAINTREE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 On a hilltop overlooking this tiny town is what Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> believes is the perfect site for a new prison and what opponents of that plan say is the centerpiece of a corrupt land deal. The 782 acres in rural <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Braintree </LOCATION>, home of a defunct religious academy and perhaps a future prison, is the battlefield for a two-year war over the prison plans that is intensifying as the state moves to buy the property and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, now the certain Democratic presidential nominee, eyes the White House. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spent much of 1986 defending his choice of the site and was drawn back into the fray last month, when the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> acknowledged it was conducting a preliminary inquiry into allegations by prison opponents that developers who bought the property for $ 3.2 million and quickly offered it to the state for $ 9.5 million were given inside information about the plans. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said was not a subject of the investigation, and administration officials have flatly rejected allegations there were improper deals and suggested prison opponents sharpened their attack to get attention during the presidential campaign. `` I do n't have any interest in that,'' insists <PERSON> Dorothea </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas-Vitrac </PERSON>, the vocal leader of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Braintree </LOCATION>'s opposition group _ <ORGANIZATION> Conserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Our </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Small </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Town </ORGANIZATION>. `` We are going after our sitting governor, not after a presidential candidate.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' Republican opponent in the fall election, Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, has steered clear of the controversy. `` Given the fact that it is under some kind of investigation, we would have no comment,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spokewoman <PERSON> Alix </PERSON> <PERSON> Glen </PERSON>. But it has drawn national attention because it involves a central element of the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> candidacy _ a pledge to bring integrity and competence to the White House _ and offers a glimpse at his handling of a complex and controversial issue. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> named the site for a prison in 1986 and opponents, who had organized when the state first considered the land two years earlier, complained that a facility for 500 inmates and several hundred staff members would overwhelm the town of barely 800 people. <PERSON> Thomas-Vitrac </PERSON> concedes opponents have no hard evidence that the developers were tipped off but contends there `` have to be smoking guns'' among more than 100 documents <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> refuses to make public, citing executive privilege. `` The governor, for reasons known only to him, has lied about his knowledge of this siting,'' <PERSON> Thomas-Vitrac </PERSON> said last week. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has repeatedly said he did not know who owned the land when he picked it and requested up to $ 10 million to buy it. Notes of an administration aide appear to show one of the developers names came up twice during a meeting with prison opponents in <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' office, but the governor has said he does not recall that and aides have said the name was mentioned only is passing. `` The bottom line is that this is a ` not in my backyard issue' and the rest of it is frankly nonsense,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Circo </PERSON>, a former <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aide who handled the project `` You'd have to have been in an igloo somewhere to not know we were looking for prison space across the state and that <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Braintree </LOCATION> was one.'' <PERSON> Thomas-Vitrac </PERSON> contends the withheld documents contain some reference to developers <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Striar </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON>. The town had an agreement with the Seventh Day Adventists Church that the land would not be sold for a project not in the town's interests. <PERSON> Thomas-Vitrac </PERSON> contends <PERSON> Striar </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON> were <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> allies used to serve as middlemen so the state could get the land without a fight and reward the developers would with a triple return on their investment. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> denies any deal took place and has said he met <PERSON> Striar </PERSON> only once. <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Republicans have been distributing a photo of that meeting _ on a crowded platform during a 1986 groundbreaking for a community center named for <PERSON> Striar </PERSON>'s parents. <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON> grew up in the same neighborhood as <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and has donated to his campaigns, but both men said they are nothing more than casual acquaintances. <PERSON> Striar </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON> say they learned of the state's interest through their broker and that they only considered selling to the state after local officials rejected their plans to build a psychiatric hospital. An unlikely <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> defender, Republican <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON>, said Thurday that he confirmed publicly that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was not under investigation `` because I felt it was necessary to respond to the gossip, innuendo and smear that might sully an otherwise unsullied reputation.'' Two appraisals estimate the site's worth between $ 5 million and $ 6 million, according to three <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> administration aides, all of whom requested anonymity. A third appraisal will be completed this week. Negotiations with <PERSON> Striar </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON> then will begin, and the state plans to offer much less than the $ 9.5 million sought by the owners two years ago. The two sides may end up in court if no agreement is reached and the state seeks to take to land by emminent domain.

<HEAD>Congressional Report Criticizes Justice Department As
Lackadaisical</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> failed to keep up with defense procurement fraud because it has a `` lackadaisical, careless, hands-off management'' approach, two senators said in releasing a critical congressional report Saturday. A <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman responded by saying congressional critics should `` put their money where their mouths are.'' Spokesman <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Korten </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> report itself was `` lackadaisical.'' The report by the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>, the congressional watchdog agency, said that the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> does n't know the status of many of its <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> fraud investigations because it does a poor job of keeping track of what its far-flung offices are doing. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said that Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> should order a number of administrative changes to do a better job of overseeing investigations of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The study did not include any review of the current fraud and bribery investigation of <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> weapons buying that became public when search warrants were served June 14. The probe focuses on allegations that defense contractors and consultants, many of whom are former military men, bribed <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials for contracting details that could be vital in winning contracts worth billions of dollars. No one has yet been charged. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> report was released by <PERSON> Sens </PERSON>. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>, D-Wis., and <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Grassley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Iowa </LOCATION> In a joint statement, they said, `` one of the most shocking aspects of the -LRB- defense fraud -RRB- problem is that the law enforcement system is incapable of adequately dealing with it.'' `` The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s lackadaisical, careless, hands-off management goes far to explain why the government is losing the war against defense fraud,'' they said. `` If any major private law firm handled its affairs the way Justice handles the defense fraud program, it would be out of business within a year,'' they said. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> proposed a number of administrative steps to correct the problem, including development of some type of recording and tracking system and written management plans for effective us of staff time. <PERSON> Korten </PERSON> suggested that if <PERSON> Grassley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> want the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to gather statistics, they should push for more money when its budget comes up for consideration. `` In short, put their money where their mouths are,'' he said. `` It just does n't add up. The fact of the matter is that we are anything but lackadaisical in our prosecution of these cases, and the current big case involving the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> is a prime example. We have had literally dozens of procurement fraud cases in recent years. We have recovered tens of millions of dollars for the taxpayers in these cases, and what they -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- choose to look at instead is how much information we have in our computer in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Korten </PERSON> said. `` It seems to me to be an awfully _ just to use a phrase _ lackadaisical way of taking a look at how cases are prosecuted,'' he said. <PERSON> Korten </PERSON> said a staff turnover problem cited in the report is part of larger pay scale problem in the federal government because of low government salaries. <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON> <PERSON> Toensing </PERSON>, deputy assistant attorney general in the criminal division, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney offices around the country do n't have enough staff to both prosecute and gather statistics. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> study reviewed 680 fraud allegations, involving charges of bribery, corruption, conflict of interests, and antitrust violations. They ranged from October 1983 through May 1987 and were all cases that were referred to local <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorneys for action. As of last September, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said, no action had been taken on 286 of the referrals. `` The majority of the 286 pending referrals had been with the Justice components for a year or more, and Justice does not know whether these cases have been accepted, declined or are still pending,'' the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> did n't even know how many attorneys were assigned to <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> fraud cases around the nation, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said. The report said officials in most of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney offices agreed that there was a problem, and it was attributed to high rates of turnover among both the lawyers and the clerical staff. The problem is the same in the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Procurement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fraud </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unit </ORGANIZATION>, a special <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> office set up to prosecute Pentagon cases. That office has had a high rate of turnovers because its lawyers can get higher salaries in private practice, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> noted. Thus, the unit has a difficult time keeping experienced attorneys.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Following is the text of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s radio address, which he delivered Saturday from Camp David, Md: My fellow Americans, this Fourth of July weekend, we Americans will, as we do each year at this time, raise Old Glory a little higher, cheer fireworks, and remember the blessing we share as citizens of this great and free land. And as we celebrate our independence and pause to give thanks for our liberty, let us also remember that the freedoms we cherish are never more than a generation away from extinction. It's up to each of us to preserve, protect, and defend <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s precious heritage. Some Americans have done just that in the battlefield. But all of us can do it each and every day _ we can vote at election time, we can volunteer to help political campaigns for the candidates of our choice, as well as volunteer for work that's needed around our community. And we can simply raise our children well, do our jobs well, and live in God's light. One man who has contributed more than his share to our country left government service this week. For a year-and-a-half, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> has been my chief of staff here at the White House. He served with great distinction helping me guide important legislation through <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, as well as helping me at the summits with Mr. -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Mikhail </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S. </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Serving with distinction is nothing new for <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>. He did it for almost two decades in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and the last four years as majority leader. I know I'll miss him around the White House. So, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, good luck to you and your lovely wife, <PERSON> Joy </PERSON>. In the months ahead, I'll be helped by a new chief of staff, <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Duberstein </PERSON>. It wo n't be a big change for <PERSON> Ken </PERSON>. He's moving from his old office where he's worked as the No. 2 man on my staff and as <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>'s partner since early last year, to the one next door, and that's good because we wo n't have time just to settle in. Yes, we have a lot of work to do and a big agenda that we got down to business on this week. On Friday, with members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> looking on, I signed the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act into law. At the ceremony, I noted that almost a year-and-a-half ago, I had said we should remove a financial specter facing our older Americans _ the fear of an illness requiring acute care so expensive that it can result in having to choose between bankruptcy and death. Shortly after that, our administration submitted a bill to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to help free the elderly from the fear of catastrophic illness. Now, a version of that bill is law. As I said Friday, we still must face challenges if this law, as <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> finally enacted it, is to work. But, we can all be grateful that a burden has been lifted from the shoulders and minds of the elderly all over <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. By the way, as I signed the Catastrophic Coverage Act into law, I could n't help thinking how much we Americans have done in the last few years. Today, our economy is strong and growing; our belief in peace through strength, which we kept despite many protests in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and elsewhere, is paying off; the first treaty ever to eliminate an entire class of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> nuclear missiles has been signed; and there is all the way around a new realism on our relations with the Soviet bloc. But despite these accomplishments, I believe our eyes should be on the future and the accomplishments we have still to achieve. For example, congressional approval of the free trade agreement that we negotiated with <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> will help the entire <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> economy grow and create vast numbers of new jobs well into the next century. Throughout our history, whenever trade barriers had been lowered in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, we've had a blooming of economic growth. We owe it to our children to cultivate for another time of flowering and approve this agreement. We also owe it to our children to put the illegal drug trade out of business. That's why when I visited <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> recently for the economic summit of the major industrial nations, I was particularly pleased by one action the summit nations took. It's called the `` Bush Initiative.'' For it, thank Vice President -LRB- <PERSON> George </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>. Not long ago, these two leaders decided that the best new place to hit the drug trade was in its most vulnerable spot _ money-laundering. Now, that's what all the major industrial nations are going to do. Yes, our nation's agenda is full. Whether it's keeping our defenses strong or cutting unnecessary spending, getting <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to pass a welfare reform bill that requires work and trade legislation that will open, not close, markets, or helping freedom fighters around the world. But, that's what democracy is all about. A big agenda _ <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s agenda for all of us to work on together to build a bright tomorrow for our blessed land. Here at the White House, our sleeves are rolled up and we're hard at work on our agenda for the future. So, happy Fourth of July. And until next week, thanks for listening, and God bless you.

The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> later read <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> out of <ORGANIZATION> ANZUS </ORGANIZATION> in order to protect its policy of refusing to confirm or deny whether any ship carries nuclear weapons. `` There must be a formula, if <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> would only look for it, that would make it possible for them to come back into the fold,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> told reporters last Wednesday after a two-day meeting with Australian leaders. Asked to elaborate on <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s remark, another high <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official told reporters Friday, `` One formula they might look at, I suppose, is the Danish formula.'' Another <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official described the Danish formula as `` informing their allies by letter that <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> does not permit calls at their ports by ships armed with nuclear weapons and leave it at that.'' The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials spoke on condition they not be identified. <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have announced settlement of a dispute similar to the <LOCATION> U.S.-New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> controversy that erupted when the <ORGANIZATION> Danish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> in April adopted a resolution requiring the government to notify visiting warships of <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>'s 31-year-old ban on nuclear weapons. After new, but inconclusive, elections waged partly on the issue, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>'s coalition prime minister, <PERSON> Poul </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlueter </PERSON>, told the <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> on June 7 that allied governments had been informed of <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>'s general policy banning atomic weapons during peacetime, and that in cases of specific ship visits foreign governments would be told that <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> assumes the visit is in compliance with Danish rules. `` The government considers that this procedure respects both the Danish non-nuclear policy and the views of our allies,'' <PERSON> Schlueter </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said June 7 the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had noted the prime minister's statement and one by Danish Foreign Minister <PERSON> Uffe </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellemann-Jensen </PERSON> that the formula `` respects the policy of our allies neither to confirm nor to deny the presence of nuclear weapons on their naval vessels.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have said a similar arrangement is used on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> port visits to <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> has not recently suggested using the Danish formula and it would be up to it to take the initiative on the matter, said one of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials. Prime Minister <PERSON> Lange </PERSON> in the past has likened <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>'s nuclear ban to those of the Scandinavian <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies.

<HEAD>Excerpts of Pope's Apostolic Letter</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Vatican-Lefebvre, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The following are excerpts of Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>'s apostolic letter released Saturday, as translated from Italian by The Associated Press: With great distress the church has observed the illegitimate ordination of bishops performed June 30 by Archbishop <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON>, who made useless years of efforts to assure that the priestly Fraternity of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pius </ORGANIZATION> X ... was in full communion with the church. ... This act of disobedience _ which signifies the outright rejection of the Roman primate _ constitutes a schismatic act. In carrying out this act, despite the formal ` monitum' -LRB- warning -RRB- sent to them by the cardinal prefect of the Congregation for Bishops last June 17, Monsignor <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON> and the priests <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Fellay </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Tissier </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mallerais </PERSON>, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alfonso </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Galarreta </PERSON> have incurred the grave penalty of excommunication as foreseen under ecclesiastical discipline. ... The results of the movement promoted by <PERSON> Monsignor </PERSON> <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON> should and ought to be the motive for all Catholics to reflect sincerely on their own faithfulness to the tradition of the church. ... I would also like to call the attention of theologians and other experts in ecclesiastical science, in order that these also feel summoned by the present circumstances. In fact, the ... teachings of the <ORGANIZATION> Second </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> call for a renewed examination -LRB- of the faith -RRB-, which brings to light the Council's continuity with the tradition -LRB- of the church -RRB-, especially on those points of doctrine which, perhaps because of their novelty, have not yet been understood well by some sectors in the church. ... Under the present circumstances, I would like above all to appeal solemnly and from the heart, in a fatherly and brotherly way, to all those who have in some way been linked to the movement of Archbishop <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON>, so that they understand the serious obligation to remain united with the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> of Christ in the unity of the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, and not continue to aid that movement in in any way. ... No one should ignore that formal adhesion to the schism constitutes a grave offense to God and leads to excommunication established by the right of the church. ... To all these <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> faithful, who feel close to some older liturgical forms and disciplines of the Latin tradition, I would like to express my will ... to facilitate their spiritual unity with the church, through the means necessary to guarantee respect for their just aspirations. ... Keeping in mind the importance and complexity of the problems referred to in this document, and in virtue of my apostolic authority, I establish the following: a. The creation of a commission, with the responsibility of working with the bishops, the departments of the Roman Curia and interested groups to facilitate complete unification with the church of the priests, seminarians, religious communities or individuals that have been linked to the fraternity founded by <PERSON> Monsignor </PERSON> <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON> and who would like to remain united to the successor of <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> in the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, preserving their spiritual and liturgical traditions, in line with the protocol signed last May 5 by Cardinal -LRB- <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Ratzinger </PERSON> -LRB- head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith -RRB- and <PERSON> Monsignor </PERSON> <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON>. b. This commission will have a cardinal as its president and be composed of other members of the Roman Curia ... c. Moreover, the spirit of those who feel tied to the Latin liturgical tradition must be respected, through a broad and generous application of the directive ... allowing use of the Roman Missal such the typical edition of 1962.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday rejected President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON>'s choice for a new chief justice, the first such refusal in the nation's history. It was also the first major test of power in the new, opposition-controlled parliament. All past Assemblies have been controlled by the governing party. The leadership of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, including its chairman <PERSON> Yoon </PERSON> <PERSON> Giel-joong </PERSON> and floor leader <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Yoon-hwan </PERSON>, offered to resign after the vote. The offer was rejected. In another vote, the one-house Assembly approved <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s nomination of a former lawyer as head of the government's <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Audit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inspection </ORGANIZATION>, a Cabinet-level post <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s nomination of <PERSON> Chung </PERSON> <PERSON> Ki-sung </PERSON> as chief justice of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s highest court failed by a narrow margin. <PERSON> Chung </PERSON> received 141 votes, seven short of the majority required for approval. There were 295 lawmakers present of the 299-member Assembly. Six voted against <PERSON> Chung </PERSON> while 134, mostly from the two major opposition parties headed by <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Young-sam </PERSON>, abstained in a coordinated anti-government gesture. Fourteen votes were determined to be invalid. It was the first serious political setback for <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> since he took office on Feb. 25 with a narrow victory in December presidential elections. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s government lost its parliamentary majority in legislative elections in April. <PERSON> Chung </PERSON>, 60, was named a supreme court judge in 1986 after serving various judicial posts for 29 years. Opponents considered him too pro-government, and an anti-Chung campaign spread rapidly after his nomination was announced Thursday. More than 300 lawyers and judge trainees signed statements against the nomination. A Catholic activist group also voiced objection. The <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> said it regretted the outcome of Saturday's vote and called the opposition's mass absention `` undemocratic.'' Government officials said <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> would name a new nominee soon. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON>'s largest opposition grouping, the <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>, termed the outcome `` fortunate'' and called on <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> to nominate a chief justice who enjoys public confidence in his ability to achieve judicial independence. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Young-sam </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Reunification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrtic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> hailed the vote as `` a great victory of our people.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Korea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> also welcomed the outcome and said the new nominee should be selected from those who had not been associated with past authoritarian governments. The outcome came as a surprise as the government party was confident that it could muster enough votes with the help of a conservative opposition group. Former Premier <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Jong-pil </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> had publicly endorsed <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s nomination, but some of its 35 lawmakers voted against <PERSON> Chung </PERSON>. The top judiciary post has been vacant since June 17 when <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Yong-chul </PERSON> resigned under pressure from junior judges demanding democratic reforms in the judiciary. Under the new constitution adopted last year, <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> needed approval from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> to stay in the post. Hundreds of judges demanded his resignation, criticizing him for his alleged pro-government role in the past. The failure of <PERSON> Chung </PERSON>'s nomination to pass parliament will strain relations between the governing and opposition camps and will be difficult for <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> to handle, according to political analysts. Also Saturday, the Assembly approved former lawyer <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Young-jun </PERSON> as the chief government auditor. The nomination was passed by 154-10, with 131 absentions and one invalid vote.

 The harmony between former Mayor <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Maier </PERSON> and his successor has hit a sour note. <PERSON> Maier </PERSON> canceled a July Fourth singing appearances with Mayor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Norquist </PERSON> after tape recordings of their practice session were released by <PERSON> Norquist </PERSON> to a radio station and The <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>.

 As the <PERSON> Tawana </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> case becomes ever more complicated, the focus has shifted from the black teen-ager to her three advisers and their racial politics. And the crucial question _ What happened when she disappeared for four days last year? _ has been obscured. Although she has maintained an almost complete public silence, <PERSON> Tawana </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> is famous. She has made the cover of People magazine and was the subject of a `` Donahue'' program. Her picture is all over the newspapers, whether she attends the theater on the arm of an adviser or visits the church where her mother has sought sanctuary. But the <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> case has become less and less about Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> and more and more about the tactics and motives of her publicist, the Rev. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON>, and her lawyers, <PERSON> Alton </PERSON> <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON> and <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>. Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> disappeared from her home in <LOCATION> Wappingers </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, for four days last November. She was found in a garbage bag, her hair cut and her body smeared with excrement and marked with racial slurs. She has said she was abducted and sexually molested by six white men, one of whom had a badge, but questions have been raised about her story, including suggestions that <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> was at a party during part of the time she was missing. Her mother, <PERSON> Glenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>, has said that the family initially cooperated with authorities, but they stopped assisting after she and the advisers felt that local and state officials were trying to protect the guilty. The advisers say that the <PERSON> Tawana </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> case illustrates how the state's criminal justice system consistently discriminates against blacks. The case has been unorthodox from the start, but in recent weeks a series of bizarre developments has diverted attention from the alleged victim to those around her. First, since the teen-ager would not talk, investigators subpoenaed her mother to testify before a grand jury. Rather than cooperate, she sought sanctuary in a church in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>'s black Bedford-Stuyvesant section. <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> challenged the special prosecutor, state Attorney General <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, to arrest her and `` show the nation the moral beast you are.'' <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> stayed put, and so did <PERSON> Glenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>. That was when <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> McKinnon </PERSON> defected. He charged that <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> and <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON>, in fact, had no evidence that would shed light on what happened to Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>, and that they were using her case to fuel a political movement. He quoted <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> as saying the case could make the advisers `` the biggest niggers in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> McKinnon </PERSON> characterized the <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> advisers' claim to evidence of what really happened `` a pack of lies,'' and said, `` The <PERSON> Tawana </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> story may be that there is no <PERSON> Tawana </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> story.'' <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> counterattacked, denouncing <PERSON> McKinnon </PERSON> as a gofer who had no access to the Brawleys or their advisers' deliberations. <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> also described <PERSON> McKinnon </PERSON> as a killer -LRB- he was a soldier in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> -RRB-, a psychopath -LRB- <PERSON> McKinnon </PERSON> received psychiatric treatment after returning from <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> -RRB- and a bigamist -LRB- <PERSON> McKinnon </PERSON> did not complete divorce proceedings to end his first marriage -RRB-. A week later an unemployed former <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> technician, <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> McClease </PERSON>, claimed to have been promised $ 11,000 by <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> to bug <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>'s home and office and <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON>'s home in order to protect <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> if the case began to unravel. <PERSON> McClease </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> WCBS-TV </ORGANIZATION> he had tapes that substantiated his allegations, which generally supported <PERSON> McKinnon </PERSON>'s. Polls showed that New Yorkers, including an overwhelming share of whites and a majority of blacks, believed that <PERSON> Glenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> and her advisers had not handled the case responsibly, and that the latter were lying. But then came another jolt _ the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said the tapes McClease produced were blank and appeared never to have been used, and charged <PERSON> McClease </PERSON> with obstruction of justice and perjury. Investigators who thought they had seen everything rolled their eyes and shook their heads. <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Greathead </PERSON>, first assistant state attorney general, was more restrained than most, calling the blank tapes `` another unexpected development in a case that has been full of many surprising twists and turns.'' <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> was jubilant. `` We are coming to get our deed papers,'' he said, referring to what he said would be a $ 100 million libel suit against <ORGANIZATION> WCBS </ORGANIZATION>. `` We gon na go see what color curtains we want in our new building.'' But the flamboyant preacher also had reason for concern: he reportedly was being investigated by the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> for not filing tax returns. At the end of the week a standoff again seemed to have been reached, with both sides overwhelmed by the absurdity and unexpectedness of developments. It was left for Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> to state the obvious: The case will be resolved only if `` <PERSON> Tawana </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> or her mother would speak. ... Just tell us what happened.''

<TEXT>
 The wail of conch shells and the chanting of monks opened a celebration honoring <PERSON> Bhumibol </PERSON> <PERSON> Adulyadej </PERSON>, the hugely popular king who on Saturday became the longest-reigning monarch in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>'s 750-year history. The king's 42 years and 23 days on the throne eclipsed the tenure of <ORGANIZATION> King </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chulalongkorn </ORGANIZATION>, a visionary monarch who ruled from 1868 to 1910, when <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> still was an absolute monarchy. The king and Queen <PERSON> Sirikit </PERSON> lit candles and incense sticks before the ashes of <ORGANIZATION> King </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chulalongkorn </ORGANIZATION> to begin the four days of religious and royal celebrations. Monks chanted and conch shells sounded during the ceremony. The king on Friday signed a decree to free or reduce the sentences of about 50,000 prisoners charged with minor crimes. Such royal amnesties are issued periodically to mark special occasions. The ceremonies in the Grand Palace _ a walled compound of glittering spirals and imposing structures _ opened with the presentation of special `` prayer fans'' to 44 senior <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monks. Prime Minister <PERSON> Prem </PERSON> <PERSON> Tinsulanonda </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> ministers and senior military officers were at the palace for the rites along with members of the royal family. <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> buildings have been festooned with lights and decorations for several days and a display of 29,999 fireworks is planned. King <PERSON> Bhumibol </PERSON> is the ninth monarch of the current Chakri dynasty and nine is generally considered an auspicious number by Thais. Public festivities, including movies, concerts and folk dances, have been scheduled throughout the country. The royal family is also to visit <LOCATION> Ayuthaya </LOCATION>, where they will pay respects to the spirits of kingly ancestors of the old capital, which was sacked by the Burmese in 1767. The royal seat subsequently was moved to <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, where the Chakri dynasty was founded in 1782 by <PERSON> Rama </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rama </PERSON> <PERSON> IV </PERSON>, popularized in the West in the book and movie `` The King and I,'' began changing traditional concepts of absolute rule and introduced Western know-how to the country. <PERSON> Rama </PERSON> V reorganized the state machinery, opened <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> to further Western influence but adroitly kept colonial powers at bay. <PERSON> Bhumibol </PERSON>, who turned 60 in December during another nationwide celebration, was born in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, where his father studied medicine. The Swiss-educated prince assumed the throne upon the still-mysterious death of his brother in 1946. He gradually restored some of the power and prestige the monarchy lost in 1932 when a bloodless revolution ended its absolute rule. The king and his wife were a hit during a series of world tours in the 1960s. The multi-talented monarch frequently shed his normal seriousness to pick up a saxaphone and join in jazz jam sessions. In the 1970s and 80s, he and members of his family turned their attention to the country's rural poor, initiating a network of royal projects in irrigation, reforestation, agriculture and the replacement of opium by other cash crops. The king would spend up to nine months of each year in the countryside, away from the opulent palaces and elaborate ceremonies in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>. The king has stepped in on several occasions of national crisis, including a 1973 student revolt against a trio of military strongmen. The bloodshed was stopped and the trio exiled. He is widely believed to wield considerable behind-the-scenes power and is looked upon by Thais as a factor of stability in a modern history punctuated by frequent military coups and factionalism.

 Here is the text of Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>'s response to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s weekly radio address broadcast Saturday: Good afternoon This is Senator <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. This Monday is the Fourth of July. For most Americans, the Fourth of July is a day to spend with family and friends. We hold picnics, go to the beach, march in parades, and look forward to fireworks at night. We celebrate our freedom. It is a good day to be an American. We share our love of country around the barbecue pit and the picnic table. We take stock of nation's prosperity between innings during the annual softball game. We see the future in the delight of our children as they watch the fireworks light up the sky. It is a day of quite patriotism, reaffirmation, and thankfulness. We thank <PERSON> God </PERSON> for our good fortune that we are Americans. We reaffirm our commitment to the legacy given to us by our forbearers. We pray for those Americans upon whom misfortune has fallen. But, this Fourth is a little different. It is different because this year we must choose a new path for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. This is an election year; we're about to choose a new president. And on this Fourth of July, it is a time for reflection as well as celebration. It is a time to remember what has made <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> great and to use those traditional strengths as we contemplate the future. Our nation has unfinished business. Our foreign competition is still beating us at our own game. Our children are not getting the education they deserve. The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> dream of owning a home seems to be almost out of reach for the next generation. Drug dealers flood the market with dope and death. The American family, the bedrock of our nation's foundation, is changing and needs new policies to preserve it. What is most disturbing is the erosion of the public trust. Wall Street has been rocked by scandal. Our national security is being endangered by greed. Honesty and integrity seem to be in short supply. For some Americans, those may seem to be reasons enough to turn away from politics, from making a choice about the future. `` Nothing is ever going to change,'' they say. Throwing up their hands in despair, `` Why vote at all?'' But, if this had been the attitude of <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> and the other great founders of our nation on the first Fourth of July, where would we be today? Let us reject the cynicism that says that things can not be improved. You, the people, have the power to change things and to let those in high places know what you expect. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has unfinished business. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> was not founded on cynicism. It was founded on hope by strong people who built a new country by making new choices however difficult. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> was built on love of country, belief in the common man, hard and honest work, optimism and religious faith. It is your government, and it can reflect your values. And it can help to solve <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s problem, but you have to participate. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> can deal with its drug problem. American can educate our children better. American can adapt to the changing needs of the family. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> can meet our security commitments without busting the national budget. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> can meet our energy needs. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> can protect the environment. And <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> can demand a fair deal from our trading partners overseas. Americans want a restoration of integrity and common decency. Those are values that we all share and understand. I come from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, the state where patriotism and family are cherished traditions. I know most other Americans are like that too. I have great faith in this country. When we Americans put our minds to it, we can solve our problems. And Americans are always willing to imagine something new and better for their country. Americans are optimists. This Fourth of July then, let us remember our strengths, our heritage, and our power to determine our own fate. We can give <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> a new beginning. Celebrate your freedom in the most meaningful way this year. Participate. Exercise that most important, uniquely American privilege; register and vote. Get involved.

<TEXT>
 Chinese reformists watched with keen interest as members of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> openly wrangled over economic and political change last week, but they were reluctant to draw parallels to their own experience. Indirectly, the Chinese have a stake in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> reform because it reflects their own efforts to modernize their country. Successful Soviet reforms could persuade foot-dragging Chinese conservatives to emulate their communist neighbor. But for practical and historical reasons, Chinese comment on last week's concluded Soviet party conference has been impersonal. `` We are following the developments ... And we hope that the reform in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will be a success,'' <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhaoxing </PERSON> said politely, when pressed to comment. The official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, which called the conference crucial to the Soviets' domestic situation, reported the opening and closing of the proceedings as flashes _ the most urgent kind of news bulletin. But it did not comment on the possible impact of the conference on <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s reforms or on Sino - <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> relations Soviet parallels to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s experience are obvious. Both countries want to revitalize economies grown stagnant under central planning, and both see the solution in reducing central planning and encouraging input from the long-forgotten individual citizen. Just eight months ago, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> held a landmark national congress at which it retired aging conservatives and pledged to move ahead full speed in separating party and government functions and streamlining the bureaucracy. Chinese newspaper readers this spring were treated to unprecedented open debate among legislators on problems such as corruption and the need for democracy, much as Soviet readers were last week. If one substitutes `` kaifang'' for `` glasnost,'' and `` gaige'' for `` perestroika,'' Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s appeals for openness and restructuring echo speeches made by senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> over the past decade. But emphasizing the similarities between their policies could be dangerous for <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>. While Soviet success would bolster his cause, Soviet failure would give <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> conservatives a powerful argument for halting change. Chinese analysts believe failure is a real possibility. <PERSON> Tang </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiuzhe </PERSON>, a commentator for the <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> agency, emphasized `` big hurdles'' the Soviets face, including changing the thought and behavior patterns of countless bureaucrats. Western observers say reform could be tougher in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> than in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> because central planning has been in place a generation longer, and there are fewer people around with a memory of how private markets work. In addition, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> does not follow the philosophy that all communist countries should follow common domestic policies. Although <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> started its economic reforms in 1978 and could claim to play `` big brother'' to the Soviets, it maintains a detached attitude. One of the factors in the bitter Sino-Soviet split of the early 1960s was <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s insistence that what was good for the Soviets was good for the Chinese. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> frequently tells other socialist leaders _ most recently the visiting <LOCATION> Ethiopian </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Mengistu </PERSON> <PERSON> Haile </PERSON> <PERSON> Mariam </PERSON> _ that nations must conduct reform according to their own conditions. Official detachment aside, <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION>'s detailed coverage of the Soviet conference showed the keenness of Chinese interest. The news agency carried detailed reports of each day's debates and interviews with Soviet citizens saying they want change. <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> also gave lengthy reports of former <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party chief <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>'s open challenge of party authority, a sensitive area in <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> politics. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has its own case of a high official dismissed for offending conservatives. <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaobang </PERSON> was ousted last year after failing to speedily crack down on student pro-democracy demonstrations. Hu, like <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, sinned by being too far ahead of his fellow reformers. But in allowing <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> to make his plea before such a large open gathering, the Soviets showed they are far ahead of the Chinese in the `` kaifang,'' or `` glasnost,'' aspect of reform. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> still keeps its party squabbles private.

<TEXT>
 When <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Follette </PERSON> tossed his hat in the ring for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, some people wondered why the hat was so big. <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Follette </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>'s secretary of state, wears a gray Australian bush hat almost everywhere he goes. The reason is, he has the same mild form of skin cancer as President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. His wide-brimmed hat is a slight political liability, but also a potential trademark and a tool for educating people about the hazards of excessive exposure to the sun, <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Follette </PERSON> said. `` I do n't wear a hat out of a quirk, I wear a hat for very realistic health reasons,'' <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Follette </ORGANIZATION>, 48, said during a campaign visit at a recent farmers market on Capitol Square. `` I've learned that the sun can be harmful.'' <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Follette </PERSON> is one of five Democrats and two Republicans vying to succeed retiring Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>, D-Wis. `` It's very sobering, realizing being brown is not as beautiful as you think it is,'' said <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Follette </PERSON>, who was diagnosed three years ago as having basal cell carcinoma, the most common and least dangerous form of skin cancer Nationally, an estimated 300,000 to 400,000 people are diagnosed each year as having the easily treated form of cancer. It is not even counted in official cancer statistics, but still could be fatal if untreated. <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Follette </PERSON>'s case was diagnosed when what he thought was a pimple turned out to be a pre-cancerous spot on his skin. Since then, he has gone in for a checkup every six months. His physician, Dr. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Snow </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, said skin cancer accounts for more than one-third of all cancer cases, and as many skin cancers are diagnosed annually as cancers of the lung, breast, colon and prostate combined. `` It's all related to sunlight,'' Snow said. `` It's a totally preventable problem, but since when has the average person ever been rational?'' Dr. <PERSON> Derek </PERSON> <PERSON> Cripps </PERSON>, also of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION>, recommends that everyone wear sun screen with a protection factor of 15 or higher; <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Follette </ORGANIZATION> wears sun screen rated 32 as well as his wide-brimmed hat. Wearing a hat puts off some people, <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Follette </PERSON> said. `` You ca n't be a hermit; the hat is my solution,'' <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Follette </ORGANIZATION> said. `` The big brim is important because it keeps the sun off my nose and ears.''

<HEAD>Party to Review Credentials of Its 20 Million Members</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> will review the qualifications of each of its 20 million members before the end of the year, a move that could help strengthen <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s political base. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> directed that the examination of party members be conducted in the open and not `` through discussion behind the scenes,'' the official <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION> said Saturday. The four-day <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> conference that ended Friday approved a call for reevaluating party membership as well as backing <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s program for a stronger legislature, presidency and a 10-year limit on the terms of party and government officials. Pravda said the conference considered it necessary `` to carry out this year a ... campaign in party organizations, governed by the decisions of the conference about reform of the political system, democratization of party life.'' Such a reevaluation of party membership could become a widespread effort to force opponents of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms out of the party, but it is more likely to be targeted against the idle and corrupt. `` Not a single honest man should be left outside perestroika,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said in his speech opening the conference Tuesday. But the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief also has said that the criterion for judging party members is their attitude toward his reform effort. A limited housecleaning could be expected to strengthen <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> by eliminating some of the most intransigent opponents of reform and improving the party's effectiveness. And it could improve the image of the party, which the policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> criticized before the conference as having a bureaucratic stranglehold on the economy and government. Communists must go through a lengthy selection process and ideological training before being granted membership in the party, a prerequisite for advancement to positions of responsibility in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> society. About one of 10 Soviet adults is a member of the party. Although conference delegates backed the review of the membership roll, it is unlikely they would have gone along with a widespread campaign against conservatives. Many of the speeches to the conference struck a tone considerably more conservative than <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s, and the official press said before the conference that mid-level party officials had rammed through slates of delegates despite <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s call for an open, democratic election procedure. The resolution calling for the review of party membership also called for a a division of power between the party apparatus and local governing councils, or soviets. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> proposed at the conference to get the party out of day-to-day management of affairs and leave that to responsible government officials and plant managers. The resolution was the only one of seven from the party conference published by the Soviet press Saturday, and it was uncertain when the rest of the resolutions would be released. The conference of 5,000 Communists from around the country, called to review progress on <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms and chart a course for the future, acted on the party review at the urging of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has told party bureaucrats they must either get behind him or get out of the way. But he said the party still must give its members a chance. `` Many of these who only recently were regarded inactive and had lost contact with the party branch, who had been regarded as dead wood, are now trying to find their place in life,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. `` The very certification process should be a school of educating Communists,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> added.

 The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> destroyer Conyngham docked in a <LOCATION> Danish </LOCATION> port Saturday after police towed away a <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> ship that had blocked the harbor entrance in an anti-nuclear protest. Police arrested 14 members of the environmental organization after some protesters tried to climb the cables of the <LOCATION> Conyngham </LOCATION> and four others jumped into the water to stop the warship from docking. Police on rubber dinghies boarded the <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> ship Moby <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> and towed it from the harbor. The Moby <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> had blocked the port of <ORGANIZATION> Aalborg </ORGANIZATION> to demand guarantees from the destroyer's captain that the 4,500-ton warship did not carry nuclear arms. Activists surrounding the <LOCATION> Conyngham </LOCATION> in rubber boats started to climb in its cables but were forced down by water sprayed from hoses. The destroyer had been waiting at anchor since early morning in the fiord outside the city in northern <LOCATION> Jutland </LOCATION>. In a final effort to stop the boat from docking, four activists undressed and jumped into the water, but they were removed by police. Earlier Saturday, <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> tried to deliver a letter to the ship's captain, but it fell into the water. Signed by Social Democratic leader <PERSON> Svend </PERSON> <PERSON> Auken </PERSON> and others, the letter was a reminder of <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>'s non-nuclear policy. The visit was the first by an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> warship since the government decided in June that visiting warships did not have to notify <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> if they carried nuclear weapons. The opposition Social Democrats had demanded that visiting warships adhere to <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>'s non-nuclear policy, and the issue forced elections May 10. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> said the Social Democrats' proposal, if implemented, would have threatened <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> solidarity and violated their policies, which forbid disclosure of which ships carry nuclear arms <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> claims the American destroyer was inspected and authorized to carry and launch nuclear arms as late as January 1987.

<HEAD>Virginia Hay Arrives In Western Ohio</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLDWATER, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Trucks carrying some 2,000 bales of donated hay for drought-stricken farmers arrived here Saturday as <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> farmers returned a favor granted by their <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> counterparts during a drought two years ago. Four trucks rolled into this <LOCATION> Mercer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> village in western <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> shortly before noon and about 50 farmers who were involved in the 1986 haylift to <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> lined up for free hay. Each farmer received 40 bales, or about enough to feed an average <LOCATION> Mercer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> herd of cows for one day. <PERSON> Virgil </PERSON> <PERSON> Dues </PERSON>, who operates a farm with about 200 head of cattle, was the first farmer to get his hay. `` One bale is good, two bales is better,'' Dues said. `` We're going day-by-day There is nothing we can do about -LRB- the drought -RRB- right now.'' <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Heyne </PERSON>, who operates a nearby cattle farm, said he donated about 1,500 bales to <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> farmers in 1986 when the Southeast suffered a pasture-killing drought and farmers across the nation shipped donated hay by the trainload. `` At the time, I had a lot of hay in my barn and I thought it was the thing to do,'' said <PERSON> Heyne </PERSON>, who has about 350 head of cattle. `` It was an easy thing to do when my barn was full. I wish we were sending it down this time.'' <PERSON> Heyne </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> farmers were becoming more worried as the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> drought continues. `` Fuses are a little shorter around here than usual,'' he said. `` It's a little harder to keep a smile on your face.'' After the hay arrived, Lt. Gov. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> spoke by telephone to haylift organizer <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> soil specialist from <ORGANIZATION> Charlotte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> `` We want to say thank you from the bottom of our hearts. We're at the point where every little bit helps This is a good start, Mr. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> said. `` We expect this to be the beginning of a good thing. It shows that in any time of crisis we can depend on one another,'' <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> said. `` Ohioans have never been so selfish that they would n't help others in their time of need. And they've never been so proud that they would not accept help in their own time of need.'' <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> told <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> and the farmers that he was trying to organize another haylift. <LOCATION> Mercer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Extension Agent <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> said most local farmers would run out of hay before fall if the drought does not end soon. `` They've had to -LRB- sell -RRB- a lot of cattle by now,'' <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> said. `` At the market, it's a sad scene to watch farmers bring in cows they do n't want to sell. It's having an emotional impact on the community.'' The trucks, donated by the <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Rubber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, left <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, Friday. <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> also provided drivers and paid transportation costs. Another haylift reached <LOCATION> Cloverdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, on Friday with bales of hay donated by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> farmers and trucked in by volunteer off-duty <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, cops. `` Our hay yield is down and what we're using now is what should be used next winter,'' farmer <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Meek </PERSON> said. Haylifts also are operating elsewhere across the nation. Fifteen railroad cars of hay are being provided by `` Feed the Children,'' a hunger relief agency in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, to farmers in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, with the first load arriving at <LOCATION> Aberdeen </LOCATION> in two weeks. The <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION> Northern Railroad is providing free transportation.

<TEXT>
 Most Fourth of July fireworks have been banned in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> because the drought has raised the risk of fire, but nature may provide its own display of colors and lights, an entomologist says. Fireflies and glowworms might help brighten the holiday festivities across <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. `` There'll be a little bit of natural fireworks this weekend,'' said <PERSON> Phillip </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelliteri </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, an entomologist with the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Extension </ORGANIZATION> in Madison. The firefly population has been down the last three years but has increased recently with a population growth of glowworms the last three weeks, he said. Glowworms are the larval stage of fireflies. The fireflies may also be an asset for holiday celebrations because they feed on pesky insects. <PERSON> Pellitteri </PERSON> said wasp and mosquito populations are also down and `` it's one of the few blessings of the drought.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is negotiating the sale of L-100 transport planes to <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> is worried that the hunger-plagued nation could use the planes for military purposes. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dabney </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in nearby <ORGANIZATION> Marietta </ORGANIZATION>, where the plane is manufactured, confirmed the company's negotiations with government-owned <ORGANIZATION> Ethiopian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. `` We understand that they plan to open up an African cargo operation to airlift perishables such as fruits and vegetables from <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, then haul consumer goods from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> back to <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,'' he was quoted as saying in Sunday's <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> and Atlanta Constitution. <PERSON> Dabney </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> is trying to buy at least two L-100s _ the civilian version of the C-130, a four-engine plane widely used by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>.

 The Canadian Search and <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coordination </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> found the Solution this week _ three times.

But the third time, the vessel was towed into port.

An aircraft went to the area along with another fishing vessel and helped the Solution get back on the course, but Thursday morning search and rescue officials got another call. This time, a Canadian Forces tracker plane used directional equipment to find the Solution. The boat's captain decided to head for Port Hardy on the northeastern tip of <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, and was helped to get on that course. But 4 -LCB- hours later, yet another call came in. The Solution eventually was found, again, by another fishing vessel, about 20 miles from where it was during the preceding call. The vessel was then taken in tow by another boat to <LOCATION> Hartley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. Coast Guard Cpl. <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said Friday that the vessel appeared to have problems with equipment that was n't working, an oil leak that caused the engine to break down and a depth sounder that did not work. <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said he hoped the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canadian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mounted </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> would `` have a chat'' with the Solution's captain. `` We've got a line on her now,'' said <PERSON> Frowd </PERSON>. `` There's no way she can get lost.''

<HEAD>Conference Apparently Did Not Resolve Crucial Problem</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The first <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> conference in 47 years ended with the biggest overhaul of the Soviet political system since the 1920s, but it did not resolve the issues that touched off the most heated debate. Fiery oratory came from workers on the problems of food shortages, pollution and the privileges of the elite. Party members clashed over the new openness of the Soviet press. With each day of the four-day conference, discussion became more impassioned, building to the spectacle Friday of a Politburo member and his ousted rival dueling before the 5,000 delegates and an audience of millions on national television. Introducing the most radical overhaul of the political system since the days of <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>, Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> on Tuesday embarked on a discussion of his reforms in a 3 -LCB- - hour keynote address He proposed to have the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> officials at every level stand for election. This will mean <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will be eligible to seek a new, strengthened presidency to be elected by the 2,250 members of a representative body to be known as the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>. The congress would be elected every five years and meet once a year. Politburo member <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yakovlev </PERSON>, a close <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> ally, said Communists will lose their party posts if they fail to win elections as heads of soviets, or governing councils, in secret ballots of the deputies. According to ousted <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party boss <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, the proposal on the soviets was `` so unexpected'' that many delegates did not understand it. Even <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> admitted there was `` a certain lack of understanding'' for the proposal when he took the floor for a second time on Thursday with a passionate appeal for political reform. Delegates endorsed the proposal on elections with 209 dissenting votes, in spite of a party tradition of uniting behind the leadership when a vote is taken. The resolution was the only one of seven adopted by the conference that was published the day after the proceedings ended late Friday. Resolutions on <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of `` glasnost,'' or openness, on ethnic questions, legal reform, economic restructuring and fighting bureaucracy still were unpublished late Saturday. Opposition to `` glasnost'' became evident during the conference debate, as delegates shouted down liberal editors <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Laptiev </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Grigory </PERSON> <PERSON> Baklanov </PERSON> of the literary monthly <LOCATION> Znamya </LOCATION>. On Wednesday, Russian writer <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Bondarev </PERSON> charged the reformist press `` destroys, humiliates and flushes down the toilet our past and our sacred national values.'' Intervening frequently in the debate, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> repeatedly reminded delegates that `` we are learning democracy'' and encouraged them to let speakers have their say. In addition to <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, others ventured into territory that for years has been off limits to criticism _ a steelworker from the Urals, a Siberian party official and a delegate from a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> aerodynamics institute, who demanded that <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> address the conference. Three years after <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> began his reforms, steelworker <PERSON> Veniamin </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yarin </PERSON> said workers see no results. Talking about industrial pollution in his city in the Urals, <PERSON> Yarin </PERSON> harangued the government for failing to take action and demanded measures in the 60 most polluted Soviet cities to stop this `` Chernobyl-like catastrophe.'' <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> noted that `` we are all proud of socialism ... but in 70 years we have not resolved the most important problems: how to feed and clothe the people, provide services and decide social questions.'' <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, who as a former non-voting member of the ruling Politburo has had access to the special stores, limousines and food deliveries reserved for top party officials, called for abolition of special privileges. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> also requested regular reports on <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> finances, saying that as head of the party in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and earlier in the Urals city of <LOCATION> Sverdlovsk </LOCATION>, he knew the party raked in `` millions of rubles'' in members' fees, but saw the results only `` in dachas so luxurious that it's embarrassing when people visit from other -LRB- foreign -RRB- parties.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told conference delegates in a casual chat televised Thursday that `` we should take a look'' at party privileges because there are so many popular complaints about them. But Kremlin No. 2 <PERSON> Yegor </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> criticized <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> and polls on public attitudes toward party privileges published in the reformist weekly <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> News. The newspaper said that of 548 Muscovites asked, 84 percent disapproved of special food deliveries to certain officials. <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> said `` official figures'' should be published but defended such privileges by stressing how hard party leaders work. He also defended party stalwarts <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Solomentsev </PERSON> as supporters of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. A delegate said Thursday that the two officials and others who carried out the now-discredited policies of former premier <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> ca n't properly serve under <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, too, lashed out at unnamed officials who came to power in the <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> era, saying they should be dismissed after giving a public explanation of why they supported policies that led the country to a crisis. He also attacked Solomentsev by name, accusing the head of the party's chief disciplinary body of failing to call to account `` people who took bribes in the millions.''

 <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops clashed with <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> youths in at least seven towns and refugee camps in the occupied territories Saturday. Hospital officials and radio reports said a 17-year-old Palestinian was killed. An army spokeswoman denied the youth was shot by soldiers and said troops used only tear gas and rubber bullets to break up the protests. The death brings the number of Palestinians killed to 215 since an uprising against Israeli rule in the occupied territories began Dec. 8. Four Israelis also have been slain. Police also fired tear gas to disperse Palestinian youths blocking a road in the Arab town of <LOCATION> Shufat </LOCATION>, outside <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, police spokesman <PERSON> Rafi </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> said. The army said two unidentified tourists were wounded slightly when a bus was stoned in the biblical city of <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>. In the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, attackers hurled a firebomb at a military patrol in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and residents in nearby <LOCATION> Nusseirat </LOCATION> showered a patrol with rocks, the army said. It said one soldier was injured by a rock. Also Saturday, Israeli television reported that military prosecutors have charged an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier with manslaughter in the slaying of a Palestinian youth. The report said the unidentified soldier shot a rubber bullet at a <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION> boy's face and killed him four months ago. It did not elaborate. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Jenin </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Nael </PERSON> <PERSON> Yousef </PERSON> <PERSON> Muhamad </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamaisi </PERSON> died of a gunshot wound in the head after a demonstration by students erupted into a stone-throwing clash with soldiers, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio and hospital officials said. The military spokeswoman said the army was investigating reports of a body brought to <LOCATION> Jenin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, but she said soldiers did not use live ammunition in <LOCATION> Jenin </LOCATION>. Hospital officials also reported a youth was shot in the leg in <LOCATION> Qalandya </LOCATION>, north of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, and that a man was hit with a bullet in the hand in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>. But army spokesmen said they were unaware of either those clashes or the injuries. The military spokesmen and hospital officials spoke on condition of anonymity. Soldiers dispersed protesters in three other villages and two refugee camps in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, and curfews were imposed on <LOCATION> Jenin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kalkilya </LOCATION> and the Jelazoun refugee camp, the military said. Hundreds of villagers took part in the clash with soldiers in <LOCATION> Kalkilya </LOCATION> after troops entered a school, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. In southern <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, about 50 Israeli writers and artists staged a demonstration near the <LOCATION> Ketziot </LOCATION> military prison, calling for the release of the 2,500 Arabs detained without trial, many of them held in the prison. `` If the people got their rights then the artists, Jewish and <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION>, would not have to come here,'' said <PERSON> Suleiman </PERSON> <PERSON> Mansour </PERSON>, a Palestinian artist. `` We demand the release of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> prisoners, but our biggest demand is self-determination and a state for the Palestinian people.'' Israeli author <PERSON> Amos </PERSON> <PERSON> Keinan </PERSON> said several of those jailed are Palestinian writers who were among the 25 Arabs and Jews signing a symbolic `` peace treaty'' at a June ceremony in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>.

 A congresswoman seeking her fifth term could be removed from the ballot because of two minor discrepancies on her declaration of candidacy, authorities said Saturday. Two Democratic candidates said they would decide this week whether to ask the state Board of Elections to invalidate Republican Rep. <PERSON> Claudine </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>'s candidacy because of a missing middle initial and an address that said `` avenue'' instead of `` street.'' <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, a convicted murderer running as an independent candidate in the district, said Saturday that he had filed a formal objection with the board based on the two errors. <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> was the second <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> Republican congressional candidate to encounter a filing error last week. Former state <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> had to withdraw from the race in the state's other district Thursday after a campaign aide failed to file his declaration of candidacy by the 4 p.m. deadline. <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> was automatically disqualified because the law setting the filing deadline allows no exceptions. But <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> will remain on the ballot unless the Board of Elections upholds an objection against her, election officials said. There was no one in the elections board office Saturday to confirm that <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> had filed his petition. If <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> is removed from the ballot, she would have to wage a write-in campaign. She is unopposed on the Republican ticket. An aide, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Rendine </PERSON>, said he did not know how the error occurred but he believed <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> will remain on the ballot. `` The intent of the law is to remove any confusion and make sure that a candidate is who he says he is,'' <PERSON> Rendine </PERSON> said. `` In the case of a four-term incumbent congresswoman, I do n't think there's any doubt. The Democratic-controlled Board of Canvassers in <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>'s hometown of <LOCATION> Narragansett </LOCATION> voted Friday along party lines to invalidate her filing form because her signature and address on the form did not match those on her voter registration card State law requires the form and the registration to match exactly. In March, the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elections </ORGANIZATION> threw a would-be <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> delegate off the presidential primary ballot because of the same middle-initial problem faced by <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>. That case is now in federal court. <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> signed her form with her middle initial, which does not appear on her registration, and listed her address as 56 Central Ave., although her registration gives her address _ correctly _ as Central Street. `` We thought it was kind of trite ourselves, but we thought it was our job to determine whether they matched to the letter of the law,'' said <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON>, one of two Democrats on the three-member Board of Canvassers. After the Narragansett board's vote, Secretary of State <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Connell </PERSON>, a Democrat whose office is responsible for elections, said she would issue <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> nomination papers anyway. `` We were not elected to knock people off the ballot,'' <PERSON> Connell </PERSON> said. `` I do n't think the electorate wants elections decided by initials and periods.'' <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON> said the Narragansett board will not file a formal objection, but <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgenthau </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Iacono </PERSON>, the two Democrats competing in the Sept. 14 primary for the right to challenge <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>, said they might do so. `` It does n't make any difference whether it's <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> or <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> or <PERSON> Claudine </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> or <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Doe </PERSON> in the street. The law is the law,'' <PERSON> Iacono </PERSON> said. `` If you start making exceptions, then all those other people in past years who have not had exceptions made will be left out.'' <PERSON> Morgenthau </PERSON> took a somewhat softer line. `` I expect to win this election on my merits and I do n't like to see a candidate disqualified on technicalities,'' she said.

 Most of the country was without power Saturday because of widespread rebel sabotage and a strike by 3,500 electricity repair and maintenance workers, authorities said. Five technicians trying to repair damaged power stations have been killed by mines left behind by leftist rebels, utility officials said. Also, some residents said parts of the capital are without water because electricity-powered pumps are not working. Gen. <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Gutierrez </PERSON>, president of the state-owned electric company, said leftist guerrillas from the <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> have destroyed 24 electrical towers since Wednesday, downing six of the 19 national transmission lines. Guerrillas have been battling the U.S.-backed government since 1980. The damage has not been repaired because of the strike by technicians and other workers, <PERSON> Gutierrez </PERSON> said at a news conference Friday. The workers, who walked out June 15, are demanding salary increases, vacations and life insurance. Damage has cut service 70 percent nationwide and 80 percent in the capital, leaving only areas where there are military installations or medical services with power, officials said. The electricity utility, the <ORGANIZATION> Lempa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> River </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hydroelectic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Executive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, is commonly known as CEL. `` The strike does not include suspension of service, but if there is guerrilla sabotage or there are deficiencies in the maintenance system we will not work on the repairs until the demands are met,'' <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> CEL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said Workers are asking $ 60 a month increases, $ 4 a day for job-related travel expenses and $ 10,000 in personal life insurance. They say rebel mines left near the installations make the repair jobs dangerous. Five technicians have died and five others have been disabled by wounds from the mines, <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> said. Salaries for the maintenance and repair workers are estimated at $ 140 to $ 200 monthly. Electric company officials refused to negotiate with workers, arguing that the association has no legal standing. It lost its legal registration and was officially dissolved after a strike in 1980. Employees were accused of being leftists. The company says that 430 incidents of sabotage between Jan. 1 and June 15 caused $ 9 million in damage and destroyed 50 structures.

 A federal appeals court ruling could lead to the release of two Tuscarora Indians who have been held without bond for six months while awaiting trial on hostage-taking charges, an attorney said Saturday. Attorney <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunstler </PERSON> said the 4th <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled Thursday that a federal magistrate did not provide a timely detention hearing for <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> and <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> last February. `` Imagine, they have lost a half-year of their lives,'' <PERSON> Kunstler </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kunstler </PERSON>, in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said he received a copy of the opinion on Saturday. The appeals court in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, was closed for the holiday weekend and the ruling could not be independently confirmed. The court ruled that the magistrate failed to hold a detention hearing within the required five days, <PERSON> Kunstler </PERSON> said. The appeals court sent the case back to <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION> for `` prompt determination of appropriate conditions of pretrial release,'' <PERSON> Kunstler </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON>, 30, and <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>, 19, are set to go on trial July 11 on federal charges of hostage-taking and manufacturing illegal firearms. The two held up to 20 people hostage Feb. 1 at The Robesonian newspaper offices in <LOCATION> Lumberton </LOCATION>, near the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> border. The hostages were freed after the two negotiated a deal that included the establishment of a state task force to investigate their charges of alleged corruption among <LOCATION> Robeson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> officials. No one was injured in the incident. <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> were being held Saturday in held in the <LOCATION> Craven </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bern </LOCATION>, about 120 miles east of <LOCATION> Lumberton </LOCATION>. The two men had gone before Magistrate <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> on Feb. 2 but did n't have their detention hearing until Feb. 17. At that time, <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> ordered them held without bond. <PERSON> Kunstler </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> contends the two Indians waived their detention hearing, saying they were afraid to be released. But <PERSON> Kunstler </PERSON> said defendants can not legally waive their own hearing. Attorneys for <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> appealed in April before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Court Judge <PERSON> Terrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON>, but he upheld the magistrate's decision `` A lot of the delays here are the judges ... they just do n't give a damn about the Indians,'' said <PERSON> Kunstler </PERSON>, who is with the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constitutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Kunstler </PERSON> said attorneys would seek a hearing before <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON> next week on the release of <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>.

 From a woman wearing a button showing fallen reformer <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> to a spirited conversation between shoppers in a food store, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> conference encouraged ordinary Soviets to speak their minds. `` It was a lesson in democracy,'' proclaimed <PERSON> Alexei </PERSON> <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON>, a 35-year-old scientist encountered Saturday by a reporter in downtown <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Excitement over the four-day conference that ended Friday was evident. When a reporter asked one Soviet in the street for his reaction, at least 100 other people gathered to listen or join in. Many carried newspapers with extensive reports on the proceedings. The hottest sensations of the conference, according to about a dozen Soviets gathered in 86-degree heat, were speeches Friday by <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> and the No. 2 man in the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Yegor </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>, who skewered <PERSON> Yelstin </PERSON>'s appeal for rehabilitation. In his speech, <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> continued the blunt talk that made him popular among Muscovites but that led to his ouster as <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party boss in November and from his non-voting seat on the ruling Politburo in February. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> complained the party's reform proposals did n't go far enough and said his only mistake in speaking out last October before the party <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> was that he spoke too soon. But <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>, a rival of <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> and considered a conservative counterweight to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> on the Politburo, said <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> was full of `` destructive energy'' and had n't learned his lesson. At one <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> food store, several Soviets were overheard condemning <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>. The scene was similar on Pushkin Square. `` <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>'s speech was superb,'' a woman shouted to a reporter. `` Then <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> spoke, and he's a scandal monger.'' The woman then stalked off. Former political prisoner and dissident journalist <PERSON> Lev </PERSON> <PERSON> Timofeyev </PERSON> said the conference was the most lively and democratic <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> meeting in recent times, but that it skirted key issues. `` For us, practical results will be whether they release political prisoners, how they treat the independent press and whether they end repression against people in independent groups,'' <PERSON> Timofeyev </PERSON> said by telephone. A man who would identify himself only as <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> called The Associated Press bureau in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to read a statement saying, `` The conference has been a total collapse of all our hopes. `` It marks the start ... It is the start of a new era of repressive regime,'' the man said. <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Mityunov </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, a fledgling political group offering itself as an alternative to the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said by telephone the conference was `` a victory of conservative revolutionists.'' `` It is not the radical reform that people expected,'' <PERSON> Mityunov </PERSON> said. `` It is only restructuring of the system of bureaucratic management of the country, and I think it wo n't help solve the very difficult problems.'' Noting that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s call for more openness is not a guarantee of free speech, <PERSON> Mityunov </PERSON> said three members of his group were detained Friday night and fined or jailed for seeking signatures on a petition demanding that jailed <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> activists be released. The crowd on <LOCATION> Pushkin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, which has become a gathering place for political activists and those curious enough to want to watch demonstrations, was grateful for the chance to hear <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> on television. `` Yesterday we saw who <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> really is,'' <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> said. `` He's a demagogue.'' <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> lived in <LOCATION> Sverdlovsk </LOCATION> while <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> was party boss there before coming to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, and he remains a <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> partisan. <PERSON> Irina </PERSON> <PERSON> Bogantsyeva </PERSON>, a teacher, displayed a button she said she made after <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> got in trouble in October. She had typed <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>'s name on a newspaper photograph, encased it in plastic and affixed it to her blouse. `` The only reason I have n't turned in my party membership card,'' <PERSON> Bogantsyeva </PERSON> said angrily, `` is that I belong to the same party to which <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Nikolayevich </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> belongs.'' Another woman proposed forming a `` <ORGANIZATION> Yeltsin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'' and a third, <PERSON> Nina </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shumilkina </PERSON> from <ORGANIZATION> Alma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ata </ORGANIZATION>, capital of the <LOCATION> Kazakhstan </LOCATION> republic, claimed: `` If we started a petition in defense of <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, millions would sign it.'' <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> denied in his speech that he opposed perestroika, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s program to modernize the political and economic system. But <PERSON> Shumilkina </PERSON> said that `` if <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> were at the wheel, perestroika would come to a standstill.'' <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> said the conference and broadcasts of its activities were landmarks. `` Yesterday was a historic day,'' he said. `` We finally got real political debate, and it was shown on television.''

 Rangers shot and killed four poachers hunting rhinoceroses, whose horns are famed for their alleged aphrodisiac powers, state parks chief <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Tatham </PERSON> said Saturday. A fifth member of the group escaped. The rangers spotted the five men, armed with automatic rifles, in <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>'s remote northern Zambezi valley and killed them in a gunfight, <PERSON> Tatham </PERSON> said. The fifth poacher crossed a river into <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION> on a rubber mattress he stole from a fishing camp, <PERSON> Tatham </PERSON> said. In recent years, poachers in <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> have killed more than 400 black rhinos, whose horns have a value of about $ 25,000 on the black market. There are an estimated 1,500 rhinos left in the country, the largest surviving population of the species in the world. Forty-three poachers have been killed since rangers launched an operation three years ago to save the animals.

Retired Adm. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A </PERSON>. `` Ace'' <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> retired last Oct. 1 after serving two years as commander of the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> fleet. According to <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> sources, <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON> was prodded into retirement by <PERSON> Lehman </PERSON>'s successor as <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> secretary, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON> has worked as a consultant to the <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> since at least last December. <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON> said in an interview published in Saturday's editions of the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Times that top <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials approved the consulting contract with <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> at a time when they knew the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> was investigating alleged fraud within the defense industry. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> confirmed to the newspaper that <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON> was cleared to work for <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION>. `` I'm not associated with this other crap,'' <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON> said, referring to allegations that defense consultants have used classified information to help companies win military contracts. `` So why in the hell was I even brought into this other than to discredit me.'' Neither <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Lehman </PERSON> is a target of the ongoing fraud investigation.

<HEAD>Some Drought Areas Get Rain But Not Enough</HEAD>

 Rain fell Saturday over some sections of the nation's drought belt, but not enough to break the back of the dry spell, and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> farmers who were helped two years ago by donated hay returned the favor to an <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> village. And the drought created a mini religious dispute in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, where Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> declared Sunday `` a day of prayer for rain.'' <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>'s action angered <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atheists </ORGANIZATION>, based at <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` Government must stop telling citizens when to pray, what to pray, how to pray or even if they should pray,'' the group said in a statement Saturday. Showers and thunderstorms spread during the morning from northwestern <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Panhandle </LOCATION> into southwestern <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> and from <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> across western <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, northern <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>. More than an inch of rain fell on parts of central and northern <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, flooding some streets in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>, and the storms knocked out electricity to thousands of customers. `` It certainly has helped out an awful lot,'' meteorologist <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> said of the rain. But he added that some parts of the state have n't had a drop in weeks and `` We're still anywhere from two to 12 inches below normal in the state. `` We're going to need a couple of more weeks of weather like this to really make a dent in the drought, and it does n't look like that will be the case.'' In <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s central <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>, crews reported about 85 percent containment Saturday of a fire that burned 1,200 acres in the tinder-dry <ORGANIZATION> Hiawatha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman said. The fire forced about 60 families to evacuate their homes overnight along <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Little </PERSON> <PERSON> Bay </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Noc </PERSON>, but they were allowed back early Saturday, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Mumford </PERSON>. Two outbuildings were destroyed, she said. A section of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 2 east of <LOCATION> Rapid </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and nearby <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Railroad </LOCATION> tracks were closed for about five hours Friday night before crews extinguished flames along both routes, <PERSON> Mumford </PERSON> said. Trucks carrying some 2,000 bales of donated hay for drought-stricken farmers arrived at <LOCATION> Coldwater </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, on Saturday as <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> farmers returned a favor. The hay was divided among about 50 farmers who were involved in the 1986 haylift to <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, when the Southeast suffered its own drought. `` At the time, -LRB- 1986 -RRB- I had a lot of hay in my barn and I thought it was the thing to do,'' said farmer <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Heyne </PERSON>, who donated about 1,500 bales to <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. `` It was an easy thing to do when my barn was full. I wish we were sending it down this time.'' A <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> official estimates his state's 2-month-old drought may bankrupt more farmers and slash crop yields and dairy herd sizes more than any other aspect of the sluggish farm economy of the 1980s. `` It has singly done more damage than anything since the 1930s. There's nothing that compares to what the drought has done so far, even if we get good weather from here in,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodefeld </PERSON>, an economist with the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>, Trade and Consumer Protection. Fish biologists in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> are urging fishermen to use restraint while officials consider the possibility of curtailing trout fishing altogether because of the drought. Trout populations were down 40 percent to 60 percent on two rivers in the <LOCATION> Antigo </LOCATION> area surveyed recently. `` One of the things that's really important out here is tourism and the outdoors and when the trout fishermen know the fishing is down, they do n't spend as much money on bait and tackle and hotel rooms,'' <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> fish manager at <LOCATION> Antigo </LOCATION>, said of the <LOCATION> Eau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claire </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. `` People come from all over to fish this stream.'' An estimated 5 million trout swim in about 8,900 miles of trout stream in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, according to the DNR. Each year, about 200,000 anglers take about 1.75 million trout, said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Kernen </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> DNR </ORGANIZATION> chief of the fisheries section.

 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> on Saturday warned followers of <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON> they will be excommunicated if they stay with the rebel prelate, but he promised the church will meet their traditionalist needs if they remain loyal to the papacy. The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> announced Saturday that <PERSON> Monsignor </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayer </PERSON>, a Brazilian prelate who assisted <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON> in consecrating four traditionalist bishops, had been excommunicated. <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON> and the four bishops were excommunicated Thursday after <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON> defied the pope and performed the consecrations without his approval. The consecration led to the first church schism in 118 years. `` No one should ignore that formal adhesion to the schism constitutes a grave offense to God and leads to excommunication established by the right of the church,'' the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> said in his first public statement on the case since the consecrations in <LOCATION> Econe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. In an apostolic letter to bishops, he urged <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON>'s followers to `` fulfill the serious obligation to remain united with the vicar of Christ in the unity of the church and not to continue to sustain -LRB- <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON>'s -RRB- movement in any way.'' A spokesman for <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON> in <PERSON> Econe </PERSON> said the prelate and other leaders were not available for comment Saturday. To those wishing to remain faithful to the papacy, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> promised to guarantee their traditionalist needs, giving special attention to the 16th Century Tridentine Mass. `` To all those <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> faithful, who feel close to some older liturgical forms and disciplines of the Latin tradition, I would like to express my will ... to facilitate their spiritual unity with the church, through the means necessary to guarantee respect for their just aspirations,'' the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> said in the letter, which was released in both Latin and Italian by the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> said he was setting up a special <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> commission, headed by a cardinal, to `` facilitate complete unification'' with those <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON> followers who prefer to remain with the mainstream church. He said the panel would seek to preserve `` their spiritual and liturgical traditions.'' <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON> and his followers reject many reforms of the Second Vatican Council, 1962-65, including the replacement of the Latin Mass with a simplified liturgy in the modern local language. A few years ago, the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> issued a decree saying the Tridentine Mass could be celebrated with special permission. The pope indicated he would permit wider use of the ancient liturgy, saying `` a broad and generous application'' of the decree would be allowed. <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON> claims millions of sympathizers around the world. <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> spokesman <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> said recently that <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON>'s supporters numbered 80,000 to 100,000, but other <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> officials have said about half a million people turn to his priests for various church functions <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> said the church as a whole reacted with `` great distress'' to Thursday's consecrations, which `` made useless years of efforts'' to reach a settlement with <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON>'s Piux X Fraternity. `` This despair is felt particularly by the successor of <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> -LRB- the pope -RRB- ... even if the number of people directly involved in these events is small,'' he wrote. `` This act of disobedience _ which signifies the outright rejection of the Roman primate _ constitutes a schismatic act,'' the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> said, noting that the prelates involved `` have incurred the grave penalty of excommunication as foreseen under ecclesiastical discipline.'' He called <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON>'s action `` contradictory'' to the church traditions <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON> says he represents. `` One can not remain faithful to tradition by breaking ecclesial ties with the man whom <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> himself, in the person of the apostle <PERSON> Peter </PERSON>, entrusted the ministry of the unity of his church,'' the letter said. The <PERSON> pope </PERSON> said the schism should encourage theologians to make a renewed examination of the <ORGANIZATION> Second </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> reforms, `` especially on those points of doctrine which, perhaps because of their novelty, have not yet been understood well by some sectors in the church.'' All Catholics, he said, should `` reflect sincerely on their own faithfulness to the tradition of the church.'' <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON>, 82, was suspended from his priestly duties in 1976 by Pope <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> VI </PERSON>. But in defiance of the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>, he has ordained 220 priests who are officiating in 28 countries. <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON>'s movement also has an estimated 200 seminarians. Those excommunicated with <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON> and <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayer </PERSON> were the four new bishops: <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Fellay </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Tissier </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mallerais </PERSON>, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alfonso </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Galaretta </PERSON>. An excommunicated Roman Catholic is unable to receive the church sacraments, which include the eucharist and last rites. The schism provoked by <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON> was the first since 1870, when the Old Catholics broke with the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> over the doctrine of papal infallibility.

<TEXT>
 A jury that convicted <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Heidnik </PERSON> of killing two women in his basement torture chamber, including one who died by electrocution, ordered Saturday that he die in the electric chair. `` Now my sister can rest in peace. I feel happy,'' said <PERSON> Denise </PERSON> <PERSON> Dudley </PERSON>, sister of electrocution victim <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> <PERSON> Dudley </PERSON>. `` We got what we wanted. He's going to die.'' Jurors deliberated nearly two hours before choosing death sentences instead of life imprisonment for the two first-degree murder counts on which they convicted <PERSON> Heidnik </PERSON> on Friday. The panel, chosen in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> because of pretrial publicity here, also had convicted him of kidnapping and rape in the imprisonment of four other women in his <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> row house. Common Pleas Judge <PERSON> Lynne </PERSON> <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> thanked the jurors, dismissed them and formally imposed one of the death sentences. That will allow the the 44-year-old defendant to be removed from the city's overcrowded prison system and placed in a state prison `` I do n't feel very good,'' <PERSON> Heidnik </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Peruto </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, said after the two death verdicts. <PERSON> Peruto </PERSON>, who had presented an insanity defense, said <PERSON> Heidnik </PERSON> `` really did n't express anything over the verdict or over the penalty.'' <PERSON> Heidnik </PERSON> showed no emotion as the jury forewoman read the sentence. <PERSON> Heidnik </PERSON>, who has been under treatment for schizophrenia for 25 years, has been receiving a drug that tends to keep him sedated. <PERSON> Peruto </PERSON> said <PERSON> Heidnik </PERSON> was insane and was mentally ill when he committed the crimes between November 1986 and March 1987. `` This man is legally sane and he knew what he was doing and he did it with torture,'' Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON> said in arguing for the death penalty. He said later he was `` gratified'' with the jury's decision. Besides the two murder charges, <PERSON> Heidnik </PERSON> also was found guilty Friday of kidnapping, rape, aggravated assault and involuntary deviate sexual intercourse. He was acquitted on one count of the latter charge. The judge set Oct. 5 for sentencing on those charges, formal sentencing on the second murder conviction and a post-trial hearing. The judge told Peruto to file motions for a new trial, even though the attorney had indicated earlier that his client was n't interested in an appeal. `` I'm going to file an appeal,'' <PERSON> Peruto </PERSON> said Saturday. `` I do n't know if he wants an appeal or not The only discussion we've had on this is that he wants to get it over with.'' Even without an appeal, the death sentences will automatically be reviewed by the <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. No one has been executed in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> since 1962, but there are more than 80 people on death row in the state. A technical challenge to the state's execution law is currently before the state's high court. During the trial, the jury heard testimony about how <PERSON> Heidnik </PERSON> lured six women, imprisoned them in his basement, repeatedly raped and tortured them, and eventually killed two of them. One woman, <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON>, died while being chained to a rafter, and <PERSON> Heidnik </PERSON> sawed up her body and fed part of the remains to the other captives, according to testimony. Ms. <PERSON> Dudley </PERSON> was electrocuted when <PERSON> Heidnik </PERSON> touched live wires to her chains while she stood in a water-filled pit, according to testimony. `` I was hoping for death. It's what he deserves,'' said <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Lomax </PERSON>, sister of Ms. <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON>. `` He's going to die, and he should die.''

<TEXT>
 A military spokesman on Saturday denied reports <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> was planning to buy advanced surface-to-surface missiles from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. News reports last month quoted Israeli officials as saying the government of President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> was discussing with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> the possibilty of purchasing the missile that is still in the experimental stage. `` The real fact which is very well known to the Israelis is that there is no such deal between <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and there is no discussion about it,'' said the <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> military spokesman speaking on condition of anonymity. He said <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> has the missiles needed for its defense and accused <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> of spreading the rumor as a ploy to get more American aid. The news reports said <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> was intending to buy the M-9 missile, which has an estimated range of 375 miles. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> may have tested the missile for the first time in June, according to the reports. Israeli officials said the missile could be a serious threat to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and could be armed with chemical weapons. But they said they had no information of an imminent sale.

<HEAD>Episcopalians To Address Issues On Gays, AIDS</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>'s 69th General Convention opened Saturday with a church official saying that while marriage among homosexuals and the AIDS epidemic are on the agenda they should n't dominate the meeting. Presiding Bishop <PERSON> Edmond </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Browning </PERSON> asked about 4,000 people in his opening address to `` look beyond particular issues to what unites us,'' expressing concern that the church could become a `` single-issue church.'' `` I hope that we do not let any one particular issue dominate the convention. That is not to say that issues are not important,'' he said. The triennial convention will look into the issue of setting a policy to recognize `` single-sex marriages.'' `` We have a ministry to the gay community,'' <PERSON> Browning </PERSON> said. `` We are struggling to find out what that means. We are not going to back away from it, because there are some voices that question whether this is the thing to do. `` The way we can be more understanding is to stay in communication and avoid a judgmental approach in this ministry.'' The Rev. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, deputy president of the convention's <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, said the church should recognize all relationships regardless of sexual preference `` We have been supportive of -LRB- single-sex -RRB- marriage and we have to get back to that,'' <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> said. `` We're being unfaithful to marriage.'' Gay rights became an open issue in the church in 1976 when the general convention affirmed gays as `` children of God,'' decried violence and prejudice against them and asked a special church commission to study whether they should be ordained to the priesthood. In 1979, despite a positive recommendation of the special commission, the convention narrowly defeated a proposal to open the priesthood to gays. Twenty-one bishops, including <PERSON> Browning </PERSON>, immediately declared their opposition to the ban. Despite the ban, gays continued to be ordained since bishops had a wide latitude in interpretation within their dioceses. Also on the convention's agenda are women's roles in the church and compassion toward AIDS victims. Earlier Saturday, in his address to the opening session of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> said `` the greatest shame of the Episcopal church is the lack of intensity of faith.'' <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> cited a survey by the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post-L.A. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> news service that showed Episcopalians are less likely than members of other denominations to say religion is `` very important'' in their lives. `` Overall, 55 percent of Americans and 61 percent of Protestants, but only 41 percent of Episcopalians, said that religion was very important,'' <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> has 2.6 million members and 15,000 ordained clergy in 7,500 parishes in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, church officials said.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> picked fellow governor <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> Saturday to nominate him for president at the national convention, as the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> nominee-to-be met with two congressmen and prepared to host <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> on July Fourth. <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> is the second southerner named to a prominent convention speaking role. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> State Treasurer <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> was named last week to deliver the keynote speech opening the convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> July 18. <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> will address the delegates the next night, formally nominating <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for the party's presidential nomination. He will deliver a 15-minute speech focusing on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' record as <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor and his leadership abilities, the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign said. `` <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> is a leader among the nation's governors who shares my commitment to building a strong economic future,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said in a campaign statement. `` He is an eloquent spokesman for our party.'' <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON>, who has worked at lengths with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as part of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, told a news conference in <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is sincere about wanting to spur economic development in the South. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` was very forthright in discussing with me how profoundly concerned he was that our part of the country was so economically depressed and had been so neglected by the national administration, and he said he just did n't understand how you could have a national government that did n't try to help distressed areas of the country,'' <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> said. `` I think the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people ought to know that,'' <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> said. `` He cares about people who are n't as well off as he thinks they ought to be, who do n't have the opportunities that they ought to have. That counts for a lot with me.'' Tradition at recent conventions is for a brief nominating speech followed by one or two seconding speeches. But <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Gearan </PERSON> said <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> would deliver the sole nominating address. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who is expected to have his name placed into nomination as well, was scheduled to visit <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on Monday. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON>, were to dine with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON>. They then were to attend the traditional <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> Pops Independence Day concert on the banks of the <LOCATION> Charles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aides say the meeting is largely social but that they expect the subject of the No. 2 spot on the ticket to come up. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is being considered but <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> advisers say it is highly unlikely that he would be offered the vice presidential nomination. For his part, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has said he has decided whether he would accept if it was offered to him but has not said what he has decided. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> staffers assigned to the running mate search were working through the holiday weekend, meeting in their secretive fifth floor office of the campaign's headquarters. The handful of campaign aides working on the search have elevator keys to gain access to the floor. Sens. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> are considered the leading candidates, followed by Rep. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> met with more than 30 senators and congressmen last week to discuss the search and has additional Capitol Hill meetings set for July 13. In addition to the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> meeting, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on Monday was scheduled to deliver a speech on national security. He returned from a <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> campaign swing Friday afternoon and was back at the <LOCATION> Statehouse </LOCATION> on Saturday morning. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, aides said, spent the majority of his time tending to state business but also held an hour-long meeting with Reps. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Obey </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> is chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>; Obey sits on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Report: Paisley, While Still At Pentagon, Helped RCA Get Military
Contract</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Former <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> research chief <PERSON> Melvyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> helped <ORGANIZATION> RCA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> gain new <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> business after the company's role in another big military project was cut back, in what was allegedly a quid pro quo arrangement, according to a published report <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> reported in its July 4 edition that <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>, who has emerged as a key figure in the ongoing investigation of abuses in the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s weapons-buying system, brought RCA `` into the lucrative submarine electronics business'' through a $ 2.4 billion project then known as the Submarine Advanced Combat System, of SUBACS. Several sources told the newspaper that competition for the project was cosmetic and that RCA had been destined to win. But the newspaper said it was unclear why <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>, who served at the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> from 1981 through April 1987, helped RCA obtain the SUBACS contract in January 1986. In other developments related to the defense probe: _ The <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported in Saturday's editions that retired Adm. <PERSON> James </PERSON> A `` Ace'' <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> denied in an interview that he was involved bribery and fraud in the defense contracting industry. <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON>, who has worked as a consultant to the <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> since at least last December, also accused a `` very vindictive clique'' of trying to destroy him and former <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehman </PERSON>. `` I'm not associated with this other crap,'' <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON> said, referring to allegations that defense consultants have used classified information to help companies win military contracts. <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON> is not a target of the ongoing fraud investigation, although his name appeared on a search warrant served at <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION>' <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> headquarters last month. _ The <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> newspaper also said sources have told the newspaper that <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> was the subject of a 1983 <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> probe that examined allegations of bribery and electronic eavesdropping The newspaper, citing an unidentified source familiar with the 1983 investigation, said then-U.S. Attorney <PERSON> Elsie </PERSON> <PERSON> Munsell </PERSON> declined to prosecute <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> following the probe in part because the statute of limitations on the electronic eavesdropping, which allegedly took place in 1970, had expired. She also declined to prosecute, the source said, because the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, on whose behalf <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> had allegedly paid bribes, had already pleaded guilty to charges of failing to disclose at least $ 7 million in commissions it paid to overseas agents to help win airline orders. Both Ms. <PERSON> Munsell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>, who succeeded her in 1986 and is now managing the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> fraud investigation, declined comment. <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Barcella </PERSON>, dismissed the report as `` a regurgitation of unfounded allegations that have been examined many times.'' In its story, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>'s involvement with <ORGANIZATION> RCA </ORGANIZATION> came as the company's role in the Aegis shipboard electronics program was significantly reduced when the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> awarded <ORGANIZATION> Sperry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> a second-source contract on the project. <PERSON> Sperry </PERSON> is now part of the Detroit-based <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` RCA executives paid a call on <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> and said ` Why are you messing Aegis up?''' the newspaper quoted one source as saying. <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>'s `` answer was ` just shut up and accept it and I'll take care of you in other ways.''' At the time, <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s Federal Systems Division in <LOCATION> Manassas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, was designing the SUBACS signal processing and targeting system for the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s newest attack submarines. As the company encountered some technical problems and cost overruns with the project, members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> began questioning the program, and <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials, including <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>, expressed concern about its fate. The newspaper quoted one sources as saying there was `` clear bias against <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'' and another as saying `` <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> was determined to get to competition with <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> decided to break up the submarine combat program and RCA joined the competition to build it, but `` it was a beauty contest,'' a source said. The competition `` does n't mean anything. RCA -LRB- had -RRB- already been selected.'' Several months after the contract was awarded to RCA, the firm was acquired by <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Shuman </PERSON> declined to comment on the contract, saying `` as far as we know we are not part of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- investigation -RRB-,'' the newspaper said. It said <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Barcella </PERSON>, declined to discuss his client's involvement in the project.

 Flags flew at half staff throughout the city Saturday for five firefighters killed in one fire, and condolences came in from other firefighters from around the nation.

Fire Chief <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Aiellos </PERSON> said a police captain from <PERSON> Fort </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> and two assistants who have had counseling experience met twice with <LOCATION> Hackensack </LOCATION> firefighters in an effort to alleviate `` this type of stress.

Firefighters and law enforcement officials from across the country sent messages of condolence, <PERSON> Aiellos </PERSON> said. `` We've had calls from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, It's very touching,'' <PERSON> Aiellos </PERSON> said. Flags throughout the city were lowered to half-staff, black bunting draped a firehouse and <PERSON> Aiellos </PERSON> began meeting with the victims' families Saturday to try to comfort them. `` I'd just like to say there may be as good firefighters in the country, in the world. There's no better, absolutely none better,'' <PERSON> Aiellos </PERSON> said. `` I've seen these guys in operation. When the time comes, they do their job, no matter the risk involved,' he said. The firefighters were killed instantly when the building's interior roof collapsed at <ORGANIZATION> Hackensack </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> The firefighters were trying to cut a hole in the ceiling so they could extinguish the fire burning between the false ceiling and the roof. <PERSON> Aiellos </PERSON> said the dealership, which he estimated was 30 years old, met existing building codes when it was constructed. But revised codes probably would have forced the owners to rethink the design, he said. He did not say how the construction might have been different under current fire codes. The <ORGANIZATION> Bergen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> joined the city's fire department in investigating the cause of the blaze, but preliminary investigation indicated that arson was not to blame, <PERSON> Aiellos </PERSON> said. Company officials declined to comment and <PERSON> Aiellos </PERSON> said authorities could not put a dollar figure on the damage. Killed in the blaze were Capt. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, 54, a 24-year firefighter who had four children; Lt. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Reinhagen </PERSON>, 48, with 23 years in the department and two children; firefighter <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Krejsa </PERSON>, 52, with 24 years' experience and three children; firefighter <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Radumski </PERSON> 38, a 13-year firefighter with one child; and firefighter <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ennis </PERSON>, 30, a five-year veteran with one child.

<HEAD>Jackson To Take Minority Planks To Floor Of Democratic Convention</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said Saturday he will go to the floor of the Democratic National Convention to push for including a dozen of his policy proposals in the party's platform. `` We ... are determined at this point to take all 12 of our minority planks to the floor in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> ... in order to inform, inspire and open up the process, to make our convention one of substance,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said at a news conference on the lawn of his home. The convention's <ORGANIZATION> Platform </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> last week overwhelmingly rejected the planks proposed by <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, including a call for boosting taxes on the wealthy, freezing defense spending, pledging no first use of nuclear weapons and doubling the money spent on education. `` We will take to the convention ... the kind of program agenda that will expand our party and make us stronger,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. Asked whether he thought his decision might divide the party, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said that was `` an unfair accusation ... we can have unity without uniformity.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he looked forward to discussing the convention and party platform at his Fourth of July meeting in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, when the candidates and their wives are to have dinner together and attend a concert. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> made his remarks after meeting at his home with a group of key advisers, including his campaign chairman, <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> speaker, platform committee chairwoman <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> <PERSON> Norton </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>'s non-voting delegate in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> supporters contended that the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> proposals would cost the party support among moderate voters and provide campaign ammunition to Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> defense contract procurement scandal had encouraged him to go to the convention floor with his defense spending freeze proposal. He said `` no one feels any more insecure'' after <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> announced Friday his decision to freeze $ 1.1 billion worth of contracts thought to be tainted. `` If we in fact cut our military budget without cutting our defense and more effectively use our resources for long-term health care, affordable housing and education, we will be a better and stronger nation,'' he said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said there had been `` good negotiations'' so far with the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> camp, which would continue prior to the July 18 start of the convention, but he said he could not imagine a convention `` where there is simply no floor debate.''

 A car bomb exploded Saturday outside a stadium as thousands of fans left a rugby match, killing two people, injuring 26 and setting nearby buildings ablaze, police and witnesses said. The minister of law and order, <PERSON> Adriaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON>, blamed the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the main organization trying to overthrow the white-led government. <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> called the attack `` barbaric'' and said police will `` leave no stone unturned to find the murderers and to ensure the safety of our people.'' The blast occurred on a street alongside <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Ellis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> stadium minutes after crowds began pouring from the complex following the match. Police spokesman <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Louw </PERSON> said the bomb went off at 5:07 p.m. The rugby players and virtually all the spectators at the game between <LOCATION> Transvaal </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> were white. The stadium is the largest sports facility in the <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> area and seats 75,000. No attendance figure was available. However, rugby is the most popular team sport among whites and Saturday afternoon matches generally attract at least 25,000 fans. Police said the two men killed were white and that several of the injured were in serious condition. The injured included 23 whites, two blacks and one Asian, police said. The explosion occurred one day after the government proposed tough new measures to enforce racial segregation. Critics said the laws could mean mass eviction of blacks from areas designated for whites only. Metal from the car that exploded was found up to 200 yards away from the blast, witnesses said. Several nearby cars and buses were extensively damaged, police said. Surrounding buildings in the downtown area were set ablaze, but the fires were extinguished within minutes, witnesses said. Sportswriters covering the match said they saw flames leaping more than 100 feet into the air after the explosion, the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> reported. Police quickly cordoned off the area as several hundred bystanders gathered. Several whites made racial slurs at blacks and one minor scuffle broke out, <ORGANIZATION> SAPA </ORGANIZATION> reported. The blast was the latest in a recent series of bombs aimed at civilian targets in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>, the capital. There have been more than 90 bombings since the government declared a nationwide state of emergency in June 1986. About 25 have occurred this year. Police have blamed virtually all the attacks on the African National Congress. The <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Lusaka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>, seldom confirms or denies involvement in specific attacks. However, recent statements by <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> leaders suggest the organization now approves of attacks on civilians, reversing its long-standing policy of striking mostly at military and government targets. On Thursday, 13 whites and one black were hurt by a bomb that exploded outside a fast-food restaurant in a <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> shopping center at the Poyntons Building, which houses the air force and prison service headquarters. Hospital officials said no one was hurt seriously. The country is run under a system of apartheid, a policy of segregatin that preserves power and privilege for <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s 5 million whites and denies rights and a voice in national affairs to its 26 million blacks. On Friday, the government proposed amendments to the 35-year-old Group Areas Act, which restricts blacks to certain areas. The change calls for the hiring of inspectors to check violations of the law. It would make it easier for authorities to confiscate property and to evict and prosecute people living in areas not designated for their race group. The amendment is to be debated next month.

 Newspapers published on Saturday what television had not shown the day before _ a fired <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> official's stinging criticism of some of the most powerful men in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, the former <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief who was fired in November, denounced Politburo member <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Solomentsev </PERSON> and others who served under the late President <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> now is blamed for leading the country into a period of stagnation and corruption during his rule from 1964-1982. But <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> also demanded that such hidden subjects as <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> finances be made public along with detailed biographies of the nation's leaders and information about their luxurious summer homes and guest houses. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> made he speech Friday at the final day of the four-day <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> conference. Television showed segments of his address, including his appeal for political rehabilitation but ignored his critical comments. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> was fired as <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party chief and removed as a non-voting member of the ruling Politburo because of his remarks at a party <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meeting last October. His comments at that meeting have never been published, but officials said he blamed the bureaucracy for slowing the pace of reform planned by Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. In his speech Friday as carried by the Soviet press, <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> said: `` Today it turns out that the only one guilty in the stagnation was <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>. But where were they who for 10, 15, 20 years, now as well as then, were on the Politburo? Each time they voted in favor of various programs.'' He said those Politburo members brought the country to the brink of crisis by electing a gravely ill <PERSON> Konstantin </PERSON> <PERSON> U. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chernenko </PERSON> party leader in 1984. <PERSON> Chernenko </PERSON> died a year later and was succeeded by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Solomentsev </PERSON>, 74-year-old head of the party's <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> that is responsible for reviewing allegations of misconduct by party members, of being soft on officials suspected of corruption `` I have to say this liberalism from Comrade Solomentsev toward people who took bribes in the millions raises anxiety.'' <PERSON> Solomentsev </PERSON> was made a non-voting member of the Politburo in 1971 and a full member in 1983. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> said several Politburo members, who he did not identify, should be made to answer for their part in creating serious problems and then removed from the ruling body. That remark drew applause from some of the 5,000 delegates at the conference, according to the transcripts published by the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper Pravda and government daily <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION>. While Soviet television did not carry <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>'s critical comments, it did cover in full <PERSON> Yegor </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>'s attack on <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>. The two are political rivals and <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> has urged that <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>, the Kremlin's No. 2 man, quit. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> told the conference he knew how much money local party organizations contribute to the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> but he did n't know where it all went `` I only see that besides rational expenditures, they -LRB- party leaders -RRB- build luxurious guest houses, sanatoriums and dachas of such a size that it's embarrassing when people visit from other -LRB- foreign -RRB- parties,'' he said. He called for open publication of biographies, incomes and other information about ruling party officials. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> did not directly criticize <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, but he said he did not understand the general secretary's proposal to make party leaders also the head of the corresponding government council. The plan apparently would ensure continued party dominance of the government. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> also said that despite <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s efforts to open up the party to greater debate and criticism, members of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> still were afraid to express their views if they differed from the party leader.

 Hundreds of women demonstrated Saturday in the <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> capital of <LOCATION> Lahore </LOCATION> against their country's implementation of Islamic law last month Many women fear the new code will negate Moslem laws enacted in 1961 giving women the right to file for divorce or to demand the right to register marriages and divorces. The demonstration by about 400 women was the second in as many weeks against the change, announced in a decree June 15 by President <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> ul-Haq </PERSON>. In his televised address, <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> said Islamic law would be the `` supreme law'' of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. But he said the laws would not affect the nation's non-Moslems.

 South African commandos failed in a plan to free four South Africans held in a maximum security prison and accused of terrorist attacks, security sources said Saturday. The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said an unspecified number of commandos had planned to intercept a police convoy carrying the four detainees from a <LOCATION> Harare </LOCATION> magistrate's court to the <LOCATION> Chikurubi </LOCATION> maximum security prison 12 miles outside of <LOCATION> Harare </LOCATION> on Thursday. They gave no reason why the purported plan failed, but said weapons and tear gas grenades were found near the route to the prison. The four arrested whites are accused of involvement in five attacks on African National Congress facilities in <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>. The predominantly black <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> is the main guerrilla organization fighting <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s white-dominated government. The four suspects appeared briefly Thursday before <LOCATION> Harare </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Chitunhu </PERSON> and were remanded in custody to July 29. They are identified as <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Woods </PERSON>, 35, a former <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> central intelligence officer; <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 34; <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bawden </PERSON>, 30, and <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bawden </PERSON>, 32. They were arrested after a car bomb demolished part of a house occupied by <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> officials in the city of <LOCATION> Bulawayo </LOCATION> on Jan. 11. The driver of the car carrying the explosives was killed in the blast. There was no official comment from the government on the report by the security sources that South African commandos had planned to free the four. The sources said that after attacking the police convoy the commandos intended to use a stolen <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> air force helicopter to fly the freed prisoners to an airstrip near the town of <LOCATION> Kwekwe </LOCATION>, 125 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Harare </LOCATION>, where a South African transport plane was waiting to take them out of the country.

 The current wave of school reforms is bound to fail and teachers will face an angry backlash unless they try radically different ways of educating children, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON> said Saturday. <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON>, in an interview and later in a keynote address to 3,000 delegates at the AFT convention, said, `` You ca n't stay out of the issue of transforming the schools.'' `` We are only educating to a fairly modest level of education a shockingly small proportion of the youngsters who go to school,'' he said in his 95-minute speech. Public schools could face the same, slow `` death on the installment plan'' that beset the American auto industry, he said. `` It is n't that we're not trying hard or that we're not good enough,'' said <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON>. `` The problem is in the way you've organized this whole thing, just as it was n't the auto worker who was laying down on the job It was a stupid assembly line and a rotten design of an automobile.'' He called reform `` a life-and-death issue for <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> public education, for our profession and for our union,'' and suggested that local unions and school boards try things like experimental schools within schools `` Nobody else is going to do it,'' he said. `` And if we do n't do it, a lot of the hard-won gains of collective bargaining are going to be lost. We're going to be dismantled by breaking up the districts.'' `` The reform movement has raised very high expectations ... and as those expectations are not realized _ which I do not believe they will be ... there will be anger and backlash.'' `` The threats are there,'' said <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON>, pointing to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>'s recent move to take over the educationally bankrupt <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> schools as well as efforts to create a separate district in <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>'s inner city and continuing calls for vouchers that parents could use in public or private schools. He said the dilemma was acute for the AFT, most of whose 670,000 members teach in big cities where public schools face the greatest difficulties. `` Who's going to be in bankruptcy? It's going to be the urban areas. It's not going to be most of the nice NEA -LRB- suburban -RRB- districts,'' said <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> teachers actually belong to the rival <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, but <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON> said, `` Mostly it will be an AFT problem.'' <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assessment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Progress </ORGANIZATION> has shown 80 percent or more of the 17-year-olds still in school can not handle algebra or even write a simple, persuasive letter. AFT delegates will get a chance over the holiday weekend to debate a resolution endorsing <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON>'s call for widespread, radical experimentation with new ways of running schools. <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON> said his aim is to get `` within the next two years more than a thousand locations'' trying these new methods. <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON> said both teachers and students should work in teams, with computers and technology allowing teachers to `` get away from lecture and talk.'' The reform resolution, backed by the AFT's 36-member Executive Council, says that despite some gains, `` much that has happened as a result of education reform ... is bad.'' `` We are witnessing major efforts to de-skill and and deprofessionalize teachers,'' it said. `` More and more teachers are being told what to do, when to do it and how _ old-fashioned ` teacher-proofing' in the name of reform.'' It adds, `` Teacher evaluation systems of the worst sorts have proliferated _ ` snoopervision' checklists ... that reduce teaching to a simple and dubious formula.'' The resolution would endorse <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON>'s let-a-thousand-flowers-bloom approach to reform, encouraging bottom-up efforts by teachers in groups of six or more to form schools within schools They would get a pro-rated share of public school budgets and freedom to try their experiment for at least five years, with participation voluntary for both teachers and parents. <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON> also said he will seek to expand his union's political muscle by recruiting parents and others to sign up as associate AFT members. For $ 25 a year, these so-called `` Friends of Education'' would attend conferences and receive its publications and other services, but would not be able to vote on union affairs. <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON> predicted it would push AFT membership past 1 million. `` Politically it's very important. Politicians do n't ask you which category of members you have or where they work,' he said. The biennial AFT convention runs until Tuesday, when delegates will hear addresses by satellite television from both <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the certain Democratic presidential nominee, and his only rival, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will also speak Tuesday via satellite from <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> convention, which opens Monday in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors gave a delayed primary endorsement to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> Friday, but the AFT is sticking with the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>'s plan of making no endorsement until both parties hold their conventions. But a dozen top AFT leaders, including <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON>, are <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> delegates.

 Americans took to the open road on their way to the beaches, parks, campgrounds, concerts, race tracks, rodeos and parades Saturday for the Fourth of July weekend, but the fire hazard created by the drought took fireworks off the program for many of them. The weekend of partying under the summer sun opened with a shiver for some people around the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> and in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. Temperatures dipped into the 30s and 40s overnight and two dozen cities hit record lows, including 34 degrees at <ORGANIZATION> Elkins </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION> Outdoor concerts were a big part of the weekend festivities. In <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, about 70,000 tickets were sold for concerts Saturday and Sunday by the Grateful Dead at the <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plains </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Speedway </ORGANIZATION>. The band's followers, known as Deadheads, started arriving Friday to camp out. `` This is the real <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> dream that sometimes gets lost,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitaker </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, who characterized a Grateful Dead concert as a unity of people. `` The specialness of why people have been doing this for 20 years is the sense of caring.'' Thousands more in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> were expected to converge on <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orchard </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> on Sunday to hear <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON>. Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was also in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, at his vacation home in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, but aides said he planned no public appearances and was scheduled to leave Monday. If rock was n't your style, an annual Festival of American Fiddle Tunes was scheduled at <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>. For those who preferred something more rousing, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mexico </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Symphony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orchestra </ORGANIZATION> offered an outdoor pops concert Saturday evening featuring <PERSON> Tchaikovsky </PERSON>'s `` 1812 Overture,'' accompanied by cannons representing <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON>'s siege of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. And there's always the Fourth of July outdoor concert by the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pops </LOCATION>, with police expecting 200,000 people this year along the <LOCATION> Charles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. The <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> <PERSON> Band </PERSON> joined in at Freedom Weekend Aloft, a four-day hot-air balloon festival at <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>. That event opened Friday with 125 balloons taking off before an audience of about 50,000 people Going in the opposite direction at the opening ceremony were members of the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s parachute team, the Golden Knights. Entertainers ranging from <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> to Chinese acrobats were on the program in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, where organizers expected more than 3 million visitors for the annual VP Fair, billed as `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s largest birthday party. The three-day event kicked off Saturday with a parade that drew 250,000 spectators. Big crowds were expected over the weekend at <LOCATION> Gettysburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, for the final two days of festivities marking the 125th anniversary of the Civil War battle, fought July 1-3, 1863. But only about 15,000 tourists spent at least part of the day at the battlefield Friday, park officials said. During a ceremony Saturday, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Baliles </PERSON>, and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Alfonse </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> exchanged original flags from the period. The flags will be displayed at the <LOCATION> Gettysburg </LOCATION> battlefield's museum. `` We remember the remarkable bravery of our soldiers, the sacrifices of our families and the consequences for succeeding generations of Americans,'' <PERSON> Baliles </PERSON> said. `` But let us only remember the past, not become prisoners to it.'' The weather was playing a large part in the weekend diversions. In <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, rain and damp weather caused swarms of mosquitoes to breed and southwest winds, unusual for this time of year, blew them from the <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION> into populated areas by the millions. `` In many, many parts of <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> we're experiencing landing counts on human beings of 50 -LRB- mosquitoes -RRB- per minute,'' said <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Conner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s assistant director of public works. But elsewhere the problem was the widespread drought and its heightened fire danger. Counties and communities in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and elsewhere banned or restricted fireworks out of fear of setting grass and forest fires. `` The potential is there for a disaster this year,'' said <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Parr </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Riverside </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, fire prevention officer. `` The brush is dry and well-cured and the danger and potential for fires is a lot greater.'' Some drought-stricken farmers got a little relief Saturday when trucks carrying some 2,000 bales of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> hay arrived at <LOCATION> Coldwater </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> farmers were returning a favor granted by their <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> counterparts during a drought two years ago. Concern with fireworks safety was n't limited to drought areas. Fireworks were blamed for an apartment fire in the <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Burien </LOCATION> that left eight families homeless Friday. That was the sixth fire in the Puget Sound area blamed on fireworks in the past two weeks. On the competitive side of the weekend, the 8th annual run of the World's Greatest Lizard Race is set for Monday at <LOCATION> Lovington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>. A separate race is scheduled for slower horned toads The town also scheduled an egg toss, cowchip toss and drill-bit toss. And a Fourth of July church picnic at <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, will feature a wrestling match between <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> `` Powerhouse Parson'' <PERSON> Melzoni </PERSON>, ordinarily the pastor of <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> `` Masked Saint'' <PERSON> Whaley </PERSON>, a divinity student who wrestles professionally.

<HEAD>Some In Atlanta Suburb Offended By Magazine's `Redneck' Remark</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SMYRNA, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Some folks in this northwest <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> suburb are n't taking too kindly to being called `` redneck'' by National Geographic. In a story about <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> in the magazine's July issue, <PERSON> Erla </PERSON> <PERSON> Zwingle </PERSON> writes of the city's relative youth: `` No matter where I went, from redneck <LOCATION> Smyrna </LOCATION> in the northwest to downtown's black <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> to the old-money bastions of <LOCATION> Ansley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, Atlantans described their town indulgently as ` adolescent.''' Former <LOCATION> Smyrna </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Smyrna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Historical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, is spearheading an effort to get the magazine to apologize. `` If the lady had said some people refer to <LOCATION> Smyrna </LOCATION> as a ` redneck area,' that would be one thing,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said Saturday. `` But to categorize our whole town as ` redneck' just burned me up.'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> has drafted a resolution of complaint, pointing out that <LOCATION> Smyrna </LOCATION> is a booming business center, with corporate headquarters, major shopping centers and industrial parks, and says that `` redneck'' is `` as derogatory as ... racial slurs ... you certainly would not print.'' The Optimist Club of <LOCATION> Smyrna </LOCATION> passed the resolution Friday, and <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> plans to present it to the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> at its next meeting Tuesday. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a subscriber to National Geographic for more than a decade, said he was especially disappointed in the source. `` You might expect it from the -LRB- National -RRB- Enquirer, but you do not expect it from National Geographic _ to let a writer characterize a town like that,'' he said. Calls to the <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> home of <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geographic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON> went unanswered Saturday afternoon. Ms. <PERSON> Zwingle </PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> Marietta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> on Friday that she did n't mean to offend anyone, saying she had heard many people in <LOCATION> Smyrna </LOCATION> call the town `` redneck.'' `` I am sorry to think that someone is upset by something I wrote,'' she said, adding that she was attempting to show `` the variety in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>.'' The writer added that to her, `` redneck'' conveys `` obviously something rural, the country versus the city'' and an `` educational level ... a rather limited view of the world.'' `` I am sure there are some people in very nice homes in nice sections of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> who share these attributes,'' she said.

 A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warship fired a warning shot near one of three Iranian gunboats that attacked a Danish-flagged supertanker in the southern <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> on Saturday, a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said. It was the first time a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warship has gone to the aid of a non-U.S. flagged tanker since Secretary of Defense <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> announced in April that such assistance would be provided when requested, Lt. Col. <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The challenge came hours after <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> warplanes attacked two Iranian tankers, shattering a nearly three-week lull in the gulf's `` tanker war. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said the USS <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>, patrolling the area, responded to a distress assistance request from the tanker at 7:10 p.m. -LRB- 12:10 p.m. EDT -RRB-. The tanker was identified by gulf shipping sources as the 337,733-ton <ORGANIZATION> Karama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maersk </ORGANIZATION> which they said was carrying Saudi Arabian crude oil. `` The tanker reported being under attack from three small Iranian gunboats,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. `` By the time the <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> got into range, twoof the gunboats had left. One was still in the vicinity. The <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> fired a warning shot and the boat departed.'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said there were no injuries, damage or casualties to the tanker or American warship. He said the incident occurred about 13 miles south of <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Musa </PERSON> island. The shipping sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the island, 30 miles north of the coast of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> southwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> gulf </LOCATION>, is fortified by Iranian gunboats. The tanker continued on its course south toward the <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION> and the <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> resumed its normal patrol, according to <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>. Shipping sources said the tanker would have cleared the strait by midnight -LRB- 5 p.m. EDT -RRB-. Radio reports during the incident were monitored by gulf shipping companies. At one point, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> frigate radioed: `` Small craft in the area. You are standing in danger. Please clear the area.'' That apparently was addressed to the gunboats but it was not clear. Later the <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> <PERSON> Mongomery </PERSON> radioed the <ORGANIZATION> Karama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maersk </ORGANIZATION> and asked for an assessment of the situation. The tanker's reply was, `` We have no casualties. We have not discovered any damage.'' Then the frigate advised the tanker, `` I will remain with you until further directed'' and received the response, `` Roger <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warship. We appreciate your assistance.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military sources in the gulf who spoke on condition of anonymity said that in following the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s rules of engagement, the <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> confirmed with the captain of the <PERSON> Karama </PERSON> <PERSON> Maersk </PERSON> that his ship was not carrying war-related materials. In July last year <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships began escorting 11 Kuwaiti oil tankers that were reflagged with the American flag. In the northern gulf, salvage tugboats battled flames Saturday aboard the two Iranian supertankers. They were hit as they sailed south from the <LOCATION> Kharg </LOCATION> island loading terminal, according to shipping executives. No casualties were reported. The tankers were still burning 12 hours after the attacks late Friday and early Saturday, said the shipping sources. The two tankers had been attacked at least seven times in the last 18 months. Elsewhere in the Iran-Iraq war, the official Iraqi news agency said Saturday that its forces had recaptured seven mountain heights along the northern border. The gulf had been quiet since mid-June, with action in the nearly 8-year-old war concentrated on battlefields along the 730-mile frontier, where <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s forces have scored a series of major victories in the last three months. <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> had not claimed a tanker raid since June 10, and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s last known gunboat sortie was an attack on the Singapore-flagged <ORGANIZATION> Neptune </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Subaru </ORGANIZATION> on June 14 in the northern gulf An Iraqi communique monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION> on Saturday said warplanes scored `` direct and effective hits'' on two `` large maritime targets'' shortly before and just after midnight. The Iraqis have been attacking tankers carrying Iranian oil since 1984. The gulf-based executives identified the ships as the 268,081-ton Greek-owned Fortuneship L, under charter to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, and the 284,299-ton <ORGANIZATION> Khark </ORGANIZATION> 4, one of the <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> government's fleet. Records show the Khark 4 was the victim of Iraqi raids on Feb. 17, Sept. 29, Oct. 21 and Nov. 29 of last year, and the <ORGANIZATION> Fortuneship </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> L </ORGANIZATION> was hit Aug. 30, Nov. 11 and Nov. 12, 1987. With <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s ports closed since the early days of the war, the Iranians attack neutral merchant ships, mainly those serving <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> claims the two countries are aiding <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>'s war effort. More than 500 ships have been attacked by both sides in the `` tanker war,'' with more than 300 sailors killed. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s armed craft have carried out three attacks since May 27 and apparently have made a special effort to avoid <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships now permitted to intervene in attacks on commercial ships, regardless of what flag they fly.

The multimedia show `` Elvis: An American Musical'' premiered Friday night at the <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hilton </LOCATION>, the resort where the late entertainer was a top attraction in the late 1960s and early'70s. The show, which was developed in association with the Presley estate, is an elaborate mixture of old movie footage, video and live performances.

<HEAD>New Law Restores Drunken Drivers' Licenses Earlier</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A new law restored <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> driver's licenses to 530 convicted drunken drivers in time for the Fourth of July weekend. The law, which went into effect Friday, says that first-offense drunken drivers whose licenses had been revoked for at least four months could apply to get their driving privileges back immediately. For those convicted of drunken driving in the future, the license revocation period for a first offense will be three months. The revocation period had been one year. The chance for an early return to the road, before their year was up, drew hundreds of people to the <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> Motor Vehicle Division office even before it opened Friday. `` We processed 214 in less than two hours,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Georgeson </PERSON>, state driver control section chief. `` The line was outside and around the block.'' `` It makes me sick,'' said state Rep. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> McInnis </PERSON>, a former policeman who opposed the amendment making the shorter revocation period retroactive. `` Putting 500 convicted drunken drivers behind the wheel sooner than they should _ it's definitely a step backward.'' The new law aims to toughen drunken-driving enforcement by reducing the legal blood-alcohol threshold defining drunkenness from 0.15 to 0.10 percent. Amendments attached to the bill shortened the license revocation period and provided for the shorter period to apply retroactively. The bill's original sponsor, Sen. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, said he did n't like the idea of reducing the revocation period for first offenders retroactively. However, he said, studies show that very few first offenders go on to become multiple offenders.

 <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Matlovich </PERSON>, a Vietnam War hero whose 1975 discharge from the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> for his avowed homosexuality became a rallying point for gay rights activists, was buried here Saturday with full military honors. <PERSON> Matlovich </PERSON>, 44, died June 22 in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, from complications associated with AIDS, a fatal virus-borne disease whose chief victims have been homosexual men and intravenous drug abusers. He was buried in Congressional Cemetery just 20 blocks from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Capitol in a ceremony that mixed the military pomp of a horse-drawn caisson and a traditional three-volley salute by seven riflemen with eulogies from gay rights activists. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> finally did it right and on <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON>'s terms today,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Kameny </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> gay rights activist who was instrumental in counseling <PERSON> Matlovich </PERSON> on testing the military's ban on homosexuality `` It's a pity that they did n't do it 13 years ago,'' <PERSON> Kameny </PERSON> said as an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> color guard departed the cemetery. <PERSON> Matlovich </PERSON>, who was awarded a Purple Heart after stepping on a <ORGANIZATION> Viet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cong </ORGANIZATION> land mind and the <ORGANIZATION> Bronze </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> for killing two <ORGANIZATION> Viet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cong </ORGANIZATION> soldiers attacking his post, first challenged the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s rules on homosexuality in 1975. At the time, he was a technical sergeant working as a drug and alcohol abuse counselor at <ORGANIZATION> Langley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> outside <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> with nearly 12 years of service. `` After some years of uncertainty I have arrived at the conclusion that my sexual preferences are homosexual as opposed to heterosexual,'' <PERSON> Matlovich </PERSON> said in a memorandum to his commanding officer. `` I have also concluded that my sexual preference will in no way interfere with my <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> duties.'' Following a hearing, <PERSON> Matlovich </PERSON> was given a general discharge from the service. His challenge of the action in court put his face on the cover of <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION>, and in 1980 the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> was ordered to reinstate him with back pay. Months later, <PERSON> Matlovich </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> reached an out-of-court settlement in which he was paid a total of $ 160,000 in back pay and other compensation and given an honorable discharge. `` When <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> lived in the neighborhood, he would come over here and walk,'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenny </PERSON>, the administrator of the cemetery where many members of the nation's first Congresses are buried, recalled Saturday. `` He loved the history. He was one of the most patriotic men I ever met.'' Ms. <PERSON> Jenny </PERSON> helped design the tombstone that <PERSON> Matlovich </PERSON> wanted for his grave as a memorial to gay and lesbian <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans. It is located on a plot less than 20 yards from where former <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON>'s longtime associate and friend, <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> <PERSON> Tolson </PERSON>, are buried. <PERSON> Matlovich </PERSON>'s tombstone includes in the top corners pink triangles that were used by <PERSON> Nazis </PERSON> during World War II to identify homosexuals in concentration camps and that have since been adopted as a symbol in the gay rights struggle. Under the triangles is the inscription: `` A Gay Vietnam Veteran'' `` When I was in the military they gave me a medal for killing two men and a discharge for loving one.''

<TEXT>
 Gunmen on Saturday assassinated a human-rights lawyer at a busy intersection near the presidential palace. He was the third human-rights lawyer killed in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> in two weeks. A nationwide coalition of civil rights groups condemned the killing and suggested police or the military might be behind the attacks. <PERSON> Emmanuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendoza </PERSON>, 57, was killed as his car was stopped at an intersection about a half a mile from the palace, according to police. Two men on a motorcycle opened fire on <PERSON> Mendoza </PERSON>, police Cpl. <PERSON> Porfirio </PERSON> <PERSON> Olais </PERSON> said. The lawyer was taken to a nearby hospital where he died an hour later, police and hospital authorities said. <PERSON> Mendoza </PERSON> was killed two days after a close associate, <PERSON> Nemesio </PERSON> <PERSON> Prudente </PERSON>, survived an assassination attempt in the same area. It was the second attempt on <PERSON> Prudente </PERSON>'s life. <PERSON> Mendoza </PERSON> was a professor at the state-run <ORGANIZATION> Polytechnic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Philippines </ORGANIZATION>, where Prudente is president. On June 18, gunmen killed human-rights lawyer <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Cura </PERSON> in his home near the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clark </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION> north of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. A colleague, <PERSON> Alfonso </PERSON> <PERSON> Surigao </PERSON>, was shot and killed in his residence in the central island of <LOCATION> Cebu </LOCATION> last week. <PERSON> Mendoza </PERSON> was a legal counsel of the left-wing People's Party-PNB and chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Manila </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Solidarity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, a federation of slum residents' groups in the capital. The secretary-general of the <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advocates </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Redempto </PERSON> <PERSON> Anda </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Mendoza </PERSON> may have been killed because he represented slum residents whose communities were being raided by police in search of communist rebels. `` This series of killings has victimized personalities who have been associated with the legal left,'' the alliance said in a statement. `` That this could go on without the government being able to solve any single case raises the strong possibilities that certain segments of the police and the military could be involved in them,'' the statement said. <PERSON> Cura </PERSON> was the lawyer of jailed communist leader <PERSON> Rodolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Salas </PERSON>, while <PERSON> Surigao </PERSON> was a chapter president of <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> in the central Philippine island grouping called <LOCATION> Visayas </LOCATION>. Surigao and <PERSON> Mendoza </PERSON> were both defeated candidates in last year's congressional elections Prudente, a human rights activist, has been accused by the military and police of using his school to shelter communist guerillas. <PERSON> Prudente </PERSON> has denied the allegation. President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has ordered an investigation into the attempts on Prudente's. Investigators have yet to publish their findings on the first attempted ambush of Prudente in November 1987. Human rights groups blamed rightist death squads for that attempted assassination, which occured a week after soldiers and policemen chanted `` Kill Prudente!'' during a funeral for a police captain and three other people killed by communist gunmen in the capital. Security forces have been fighting communist guerrillas since 1969.

 A committee including <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> lawmakers from the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> urged the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration Saturday to end sanctions against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, saying the measures are destroying that country's middle class. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucey </PERSON>, former governor of <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and ambassador to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> during the <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administration, called the sanctions `` an unloaded gun pointed at Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is the commander of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> and controls the civilian government. <PERSON> Lucey </PERSON> called on President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to appoint a special envoy to examine the situation first-hand and to recommend changes in `` what is clearly a policy gone awry.'' <PERSON> Lucey </PERSON> and four other members of the `` July 4th <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'' issued a report in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> following a three-day visit to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> that ended Friday night. The report said the sanctions were devastating the private business sector and causing suffering among workers who lost their jobs because of private business closings. `` Thus <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy is leading thousands of Panamanian workers to view private enterprise as less attractive than working for the government,'' the report said. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> imposed economic sanctions on <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> earlier this year in an attempt to force <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> out of office following his indictments by federal grand juries in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> last February that accused the general of drug trafficking. <PERSON> Lucey </PERSON> is the founder and one of three co-chairmen of the committee for justice in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Another co-chairman is <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> senator and presidential candidate from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lucey </PERSON> is pledged as a delegate to <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and has worked actively in the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor's presidential campaign for the Democratic nomination. He denied, however, that his committee was tied to either the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign or the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. He said his group proposed no solutions and its mission was `` to assess the damage caused by the sanctions to the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> economy, to the Panamanian social structure, to the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> people and to U.S.-Panamanian relations.'' The report said the committee `` strongly supports the objective of seeing that Gen. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> ... is brought to justice,'' but economic sanctions have left him firmly in power. It also claimed the sanctions were forcing Panamanian importers to seek supply channels other than the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, leading to closer ties between <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and `` opportunistic Arab countries'' as well as <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Other committee members include Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kastenmeier </PERSON> -LRB- D-Wis. -RRB- and three Democratic state legislators from <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>: <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>, <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>

 A coast guard helicopter on Saturday rescued four Icelanders from a yacht in heavy seas off the remote <LOCATION> Outer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hebrides </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> of western <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, the coast guard reported. The 28-foot yacht radioed a distress call after it lost its life raft and much of its gear in wind-whipped seas, said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Budge </PERSON> of the Stornoway coast guard. He said rescuers dropped from the helicopter and lifted the four Icelanders off the yacht one by one about 45 miles northwest of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kilda </LOCATION> in the Hebrides. A French trawler had responded to the yacht's distress call but was unable to rescue the crew because of the storm, according to Budge.

 Actress <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON>, who has recently tried to pacify veterans still angry over her 1972 trip to <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>, will appear at a benefit for children with birth defects linked to Agent Orange, a veterans group announced Saturday. <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON>, whose plans to film part of a movie in <LOCATION> Waterbury </LOCATION> later this summer sparked protests by some veterans, apologized on national television last month for posing for photos on a North Vietnamese anti-aircraft gun during her 1972 trip and for saying prisoners of war were lying about having been tortured. Money raised at the July 29 benefit will go to the Brandy Schieb Children's Fund, a project of the Stamford-based <ORGANIZATION> Vietnam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Victims </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION>, said the Rev. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> McColley </PERSON>, rector of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michael </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Naugatuck </LOCATION> and a <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veteran. Actor <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Niro </PERSON> is also slated to attend the benefit, organizers said. <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON> and <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Niro </PERSON> are slated to appear in the movie, `` Union Street,'' about a working-class woman fighting her way up the social ladder who teaches an illiterate man to read. <LOCATION> Holyoke </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Waterbury </LOCATION> were chosen as filming locations because of their industrial look. But there were protests by veterans in both towns after the plans for the film were announced. The day after the apology was broadcast on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` 20-20'' news program, <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON> met at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michael </ORGANIZATION>'s with about 25 <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans from <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. The benefit `` grew out of the spirit of reconciliation and good'' exhibited during the meeting, <PERSON> McColley </PERSON> said. `` Afterward, a lot of us were standing around saying would n't it be great if now we could all do something together,'' he said. The event is being sponsored by a group of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans calling themselves Veterans Who Care, which includes some of <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON>'s former and present critics, <PERSON> McColley </PERSON> said. Exact details of the benefit were not all worked out, but activities may include a booth where people can get their pictures taken with <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON> and <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Niro </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivers </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON> spokesman. `` <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> spoke to <LOCATION> De </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Niro </LOCATION> last night and called me to confirm that he was on board as well,'' <PERSON> Rivers </PERSON> said.

 Rates on international telephone calls have been increased an average 700 percent and on national calls 300 percent, the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Barricada </ORGANIZATION> reported Saturday. <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, vice minister of the <ORGANIZATION> Telecommmunications </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Mail </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, told the newspaper a three-minute call to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> that cost 240 cordobas until Thursday now is 1,920 cordobas. The increase would be from $ 3 to $ 24 at the official rate of 80 cordobas to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar. On the black market a dollar sells for more than 300 cordobas. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> said the monthly telephone rate was increased from 200 to 800 cordobas, or from $ 2.50 to $ 10 at the official rate.

 <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> received a hero's welcome Saturday from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> State Republicans, as the party now dominated by the television evangelist's followers adopted a conservative platform including support for <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s government `` You have won a great victory in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and I am proud of you,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said to his supporters, who swept the state's precinct caucuses in March His campaign may be over for now, `` but ideals and principals never lose,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said. `` I have no intention of quitting. We're going to keep coming back.'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s loyal army of supporters, which plans to give the television evangelist his largest block of delegates to the national GOP convention, went wild as he addressed the convention. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> told his backers they must shift their loyalties to the party's certain nominee, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, and help elect all Republican candidates this fall. He called it part of a long-term strategy of converting <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to conservatism. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> picked up 38 of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s delegates to the Republican National Convention in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. Of the state's remaining three delegates, one went to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the other two were uncommitted The vice president addressed the convention via telephone from his home in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, saying, `` We'll come out of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> convention -LRB- united -RRB- to go to fight right down to the wire.'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> told a news conference he'll stump the country for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, particularly in the states where the television evangelist did best. He termed himself `` pleased with the conservative principals the vice president is enunciating,'' and said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> should pick <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> for his rinning mate. `` <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> would be my choice,'' he said. In addition to hearing <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, the convention adopted a conservative platform, including support for <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The plank on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> read: `` We continue to support the South African government in its efforts to eliminate apartheid and oppose economic sanctions.'' The platform, less than five pages long, reads like a compendium of conservative thought. It is against gay rights, a state income tax, abortion, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, and school health clinics, and for the deployment Strategic Defense Initiative of space-based weapons, Contra aid `` everywhere,'' prayer in the schools and more nuclear development. The convention, which opened Friday, has combined elemens of politics, the circus and a prayer meeting. The convention hall was festooned in red, white and blue, with huge pictures of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> flanking a gigantic American flag. The crowd cheered when `` Uncle Sam'' rode a huge elephant into the convention from the circus next door. There was prayer, amens, a fervent, hymn-like singing of `` God Bless America'' and frequent invocation of God's name. At one point state <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> chairwoman <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> called for Attorney General <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Eikenberry </PERSON> to come up to the podium and `` address the congregation.''

 A 2,500-gallon gasoline tank ruptured and exploded in flames outside a restaurant Saturday, injuring at least six people, one critically, authorities said. The tank outside Que's Place Restaurant, three miles north of here, sprang a leak and burst into flames about 3:45 p.m., said <PERSON> Darrell </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Miller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> said that based on estimates from officers at the scene, about 20 people were injured in the accident, but officials at two hospitals said they treated only six people. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Kopriva </PERSON>, 30, of <PERSON> Eldon </PERSON> was flown to the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Missouri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, said Sgt. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Glover </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Missouri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION>. He was reported in critical condition with third-degree burns over 55 percent of his body. <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, nursing supervisor at <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ozark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, said two children were admitted to that hospital: <PERSON> Lauren </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wimmer </PERSON>, 10, and <PERSON> Shawn </PERSON> <PERSON> Neville </PERSON>, 12, both of <LOCATION> Belleville </LOCATION>, Ill. Both were listed in stable condition. Three other people were treated and released from the hospital, she said. <PERSON> Glover </PERSON> said the explosion occurred after a worker began filling a gasoline tank near the restaurant and noticed that a seam had broken and gasoline was spilling onto the ground. `` The worker went down and advised someone at the restaurant, and they started to evacuate the area,'' he said. The gasoline ignited near the edge of Lake of the Ozarks after the evacuation was in progress and most of the people were out of the restaurant, <PERSON> Glover </PERSON> said. Seconds later, there was an explosion. `` The restaurant and the dock it was on and five boats were destroyed in the explosion and resulting fire,'' <PERSON> Glover </PERSON> said. He said he did not know what caused the explosion. A number of people were found in the water after the explosion, but it was not known whether they were blown into the water by the force of the blast or if they had jumped, he said. Damage from the fire, which was contained about an hour later, were estimated at more than $ 100,000, <PERSON> Glover </PERSON> said. Lake of the Ozarks is a popular resort attraction in central Missouri.

 A team of 22 Soviet on-site inspectors was welcomed here by schoolchildren and residents Saturday, arriving to begin monitoring compliance with the treaty to eliminate medium-range nuclear missiles. The inspectors will monitor the <ORGANIZATION> Hercules </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> missile plant in <LOCATION> Magna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, where Pershing II missiles banned under the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty were produced. A group of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> inspectors arrived in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> on Friday under the treaty signed by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in December. The 22 Soviet missile experts and linguists arrived at the <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> field at the <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> aboard an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> C-141 cargo plane at about 3 p.m. The Soviet team was part of a contingent of 70 missile specialists who arrived at <ORGANIZATION> Travis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> on Friday night. The inspectors assigned to the Hercules plant will be the only permanently based Soviets, who can stay for up to 13 years under the terms of the treaty. Early Sunday, the 48 other inspectors were to leave the air base to conduct spot checks at as many as five missile sites in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> team, meanwhile, has arrived in the Soviet city of <LOCATION> Votkinsk </LOCATION>, the site of a plant that formerly built the SS-20 missiles, the most important Soviet weapon to be eliminated under the treaty. The Soviets arriving in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> were greeted by a small group of local residents, including about a dozen <ORGANIZATION> Magna </ORGANIZATION> elementary school children, who held signs reading `` Welcome to Magna.'' Speaking through an interpreter, <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Samarin </PERSON>, the leader of the inspection team, said the time had come to effect the terms of the treaty to eliminate Soviet and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intermediate missiles. `` It is generally accepted that the INF Treaty is an important stage in the relations between our two countries, a first step towards the saving of mankind from the threat of nuclear annhilation,'' he said in a brief, prepared statement. `` We should not be cynical or euphoric aboutthis process,'' said Marine Col. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Connell </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> On-Site </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inspection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's not the millenium, but it is an important step in the peace process. The Soviets mingled briefly with the children, shaking hands and passing out <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> pocket calendars before boarding a bus to their apartments in suburban <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, where they will stay there until quarters are built for them in <LOCATION> Magna </LOCATION>. The all-male contingent traveled to the <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> without wives and families. They will be rotatd periodically with other Soviets, but <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Leeuwen </PERSON>, logistics manager for the <ORGANIZATION> OSIA </ORGANIZATION>, said the schedule will be up to the Soviets. The apartment building where the Soviets are staying has been restricted and is off-limits to the news media, <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Leeuwen </PERSON> said. `` They asked for privacy just to unload,'' he said. `` They ` re tired.'' The `` baseline inspections'' to be conducted within the next two months are designed to verify the exact number of missiles and related components to be destroyed under the treaty. The Soviet inspectors arrived with a 10-member air crew aboard an <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION> jetliner at <LOCATION> Travis </LOCATION> on Friday, the same day 20 <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> inspectors left for <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and Votkinsk. At the Magna plant, which made Pershing missile rocket motors, the Soviets have the right to monitor the plant's gates for up to 13 years. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> may station inspectors for the same period at a Votkinsk plant that formerly built the SS-20 missiles, the most important Soviet weapon to be eliminted under the treaty. The Soviets were scheduled to announce late Saturday which of the five sites they will visit to conduct the baseline spot checks. The five are a <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> plant in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>; the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s Dugway Proving Ground in western <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>; the <ORGANIZATION> Pueblo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Depot </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pueblo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huachuca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>; and <ORGANIZATION> Davis-Monthan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>. Altogther, there are 26 missile sites in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and 133 sites in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> that are open to inspection under the treaty The INF pact, the first to allow such on-site inspection, is viewed as a trial for the proposed <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reduction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION>, which would slash arsenals of long-range superpower nuclear weapons by 30 percent to 50 percent, and involve much more complicated verification procedures.

 Four men accused of illegally selling millions of dollars worth of cable television and satellite descramblers have been following a two-year <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigation. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Pirofsky </PERSON>, 43, and <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Pirofsky </PERSON>, 37, both of <LOCATION> Clifton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Zibro </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, 34, of <LOCATION> Cohoes </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Fournier </PERSON>, 36, of Troy, pleaded innocent at their arraignments Thursday and were released on their own recognizance. The illegal sale and manufacture of descramblers is a misdemeanor, punishable by up to one year in prison and a $ 10,000 fine. Officials said the illegal sales ring was among the largest in the country, and sold the components in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION>. `` Indications are that this one is one of the largest, if not the largest,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Signal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theft </ORGANIZATION>, based at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Descramblers decode signals to certain cable television pay channels, allowing viewers to watch the channels without paying for them. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said the typical user saved between $ 30 and $ 40 a month, which otherwise would have been paid to so-called `` premium'' pay channels. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said the industry loses $ 250 million annually to descrambling pirates. Also named in the 86-count indictment were six corporations run by the men under the names P.G. <ORGANIZATION> Video </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Satellite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Starview </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Sone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Video </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Trend </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Video </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, according to <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Scullin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney for the northern district of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The ring allegedly operated between January 1984 and August 1986, violating federal laws that outlaw the manufacture, distribution and use of cable descramblers by unauthorized individuals, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and federal prosecutors said. Descramblers can be sold legally to authorized individuals such as cable television companies.

 Police fatally shot a suspected guerrilla and captured another as insurgents bombed three gasoline stations Saturday, authorities said. Police said the pro-Cuban guerrillas from the <ORGANIZATION> Tupac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amaru </ORGANIZATION> revolutionary movement staged the attacks to protest a recent 58 percent increase in fuel prices, raising the price of gasoline to 84 cents a gallon. The guerrilla group, which has been active since 1984, frequently launches attacks to protest government policies. Police said the rebels ordered attendants away at gunpoint at all three gas stations and then blew up gas pumps and offices with dynamite. Firefighters and attendants extinguished the fires before flames reached gas storage tanks, police said. Groups of three or four attackers fled in cars from each station, located in widespread areas of the city, police said. When one band was intercepted by a squad car, a gunfight ensued that left one guerrilla dead, they said, adding that another guerrilla was captured and the rest escaped.

<HEAD>Government Campaign Aims To Destroy Domestic Marijuana Crop</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration will renew and expand its campaign to destroy the nation's illegal marijuana crop beginning July 11 in an effort to combat domestic production that has doubled in recent years, a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said Saturday night. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Feldkamp </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, said the campaign against the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marijuana crop, known as `` Operation Stop Crop,'' this summer will involve additional personnel at the federal, state and local levels. <PERSON> Feldkamp </PERSON> said that in earlier years, about 5 percent to 10 percent of the marijuana used in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was grown domestically, but now the amount of home-grown marijuana has increased to 20 percent. He said the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> is providing $ 4 million in seed money to start up the latest eradication effort. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported in Sunday's editions that `` Operation Stop Crop,'' to be formally announced by Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> on July 11, is being described as the nation's most extensive effort to eradicate domestic marijuana. The campaign will include stepped-up deployment of <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> troops and helicopters, a toll-free number to encourage citizen informers and expanded undercover surveillance aimed at `` immobilizing'' and prosecuting major growers, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said, quoting government officials and documents. The <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said there were no figures on the total costs of the operation but estimated that federal agencies, primarily <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, will spend about $ 8 million on the campaign, with additional funds contributed by participating state and local agencies. In addition, the newspaper said, administration sources said last week they are recommending a doubling of funds for marijuana suppression efforts as part of a domestic marijuana `` national strategy'' recently adopted by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>.

Police estimated the crowd at more than 250,000 while organizers claimed the rally was the largest in their party's history and said as many as 700,000 people attended. Presidential and congressional elections will be held Wednesday. Many of the people at the rally were peasants and labor union members bused into <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> the night before by party organizers. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Clouthier </PERSON>, presidential candidate of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- PAN -RRB-, also closed his campaign with a late afternoon rally at the Zocalo. A crowd estimated by reporters at about 140,000 people gathered for the windup of the PAN campaign. The third major contender in the presidential race is <PERSON> Cuauhtemoc </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON>, backed by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> that includes several leftist parties. <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> packed the Zocalo last Saturday with a similar rally. During <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>'s speech, the colonial four-story buldings on both sides of the Plaza were draped with large pictures of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s revolutionary heroes. `` During the campaign you have showed me what to change, what not to change and how to carry out the changes,'' said the candidate whose party has been in power for 60 years. He promised to eliminate inflation, advance economic development with the help of private industry and pull <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> out of its economic crisis. `` We will forge a <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> our children will be proud of,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 A federal grand jury investigating the <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION>'s dealings with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has subpoenaed the records of a trading partner in the deal, an official of the partner company said. New York-based <ORGANIZATION> Satra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has delivered the records, <ORGANIZATION> Satra </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Ara </PERSON> <PERSON> Oztemel </PERSON> said in a story published Saturday in joint editions of The Atlanta Journal and The Atlanta Constitution. He said he did not know the focus of the probe. The newspapers said the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> grand jury is investigating Coca-Cola for possible illegal activity under the 1977 Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies and individuals from bribing foreigners or political parties, in connection with its 1986 agreement to sell <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> has denied any wrongdoing. `` I'd like to think they will not find anything,'' <PERSON> Oztemel </PERSON> said in a telephone interview with the newspapers from his company's <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> offices `` They are wasting valuable time, mostly theirs.'' Since Soviet law prohibits foreign companies from selling products for cash and taking the money out of the country, <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Satra </ORGANIZATION> have a three-way deal. Under the agreement, <ORGANIZATION> Satra </ORGANIZATION> buys Soviet-made Lada automobiles to sell in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. The Russians then use the British currency to buy <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> concentrate made at <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION>'s plants in <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>.

He was named president in April 1966. A plaque on his desk reads `` It CAN be done.'' <PERSON> Valenti </PERSON> has done it, with the help, he says, of `` serendipity in a macabre way.'' He has gone from from usher, clean-up man and popcorn concession operator in a second-rate movie house to the voice of the movie industry. He went from stumping for local candidates as a child to an office in the White House. In between, he flew 51 combat missions as a World War II bomber pilot, was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, six air medals and three battle stars and earned a master's degree in business administration from <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. He's 66 now _ trim and fit, his hair white and his eyebrows bushy, his eyes sparkling as he talks of the movie industry and how it found him. `` You're sitting in the White House and the movie moguls offer you a job you never expected to have, and then your life takes another turn,'' he says. That was in 1966. Three years before, life took another sharp turn for the <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> ad man who had done the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s 1960 advertising campaign for <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and had come to know <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> three years earlier <PERSON> Valenti </PERSON> was sitting six or seven cars back from President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s limousine when <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was assassinated as the motorcade snaked through <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. At <ORGANIZATION> Parkland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> ordered <PERSON> Valenti </PERSON> to accompany him to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> aboard Air Force One. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> was sworn in as president on that flight. <PERSON> Valenti </PERSON> became his chief spokesman, and has been in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> since. He was <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s closest personal friend in the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Valenti </PERSON> once said that he slept better at night knowing <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> was president. Although his home is in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Valenti </PERSON> is frequently on the road, making sure <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> films `` move freely and unhobbled around the world.'' But unlike his Humble Oil travels to such places as <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mills </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Horn </PERSON>, <PERSON> Valenti </PERSON> now calls on <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Janeiro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Dakar </LOCATION>. He's in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> three times a month, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> a little less. `` The back yard of the movie business is the world,'' he says. `` Movies are fascinating. ... The movie business is unlike any other enterprise I know, with the possible exception of politics. It's tedious sometimes, even pedestrian sometimes. `` But for the most part, it's been great fun,'' he said in a recent interview. `` There's a continuing roll of problems _ that sort of avalanche on you. But all are different and you're constantly meeting new and interesting people. His contract with the association has been renewed several times since 1966, and the current one does n't expire until the end of 1991. `` As long as I'm having fun here, I'll stay,'' he said. As a child, <PERSON> Valenti </PERSON> tasted politics and power through his father. He was 10 when he gave his first political speech _ for a sheriff. `` Very early on, I went on the stump _ everyone thought that was cute,'' he said. He finished high school at 15 and spent the next year working seven days a week at the Iris Theater, where Tarzan movies and cowboy flicks were the main fare. After a year, he realized he wanted an education: `` I really wanted to be a writer. I really wanted to be a lawyer.'' <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Beach </PERSON>, his boss at <ORGANIZATION> Humble </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION>, says he's not surprised by <PERSON> Valenti </PERSON>'s success. `` He was a very bright and energetic and imaginative young man _ really eager and anxious to do right, and truly applied himself to whatever he was doing,'' said <PERSON> Beach </PERSON>, who was in charge of publications for Humble until his retirement in 1970. `` I had a feeling he would spread out,'' <PERSON> Beach </PERSON> said. `` He had both the personality and the education and the ambition to go places. He had stars in his eyes all along.''

 Though a mood of caution and indecision prevailed in the stock market for much of the time, there were still a good many success stories to be told on Wall Street in the first half of 1988. Indeed, in the waning days of June, 31 issues traded on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> had doubled or more from their 1987 closing prices. As any follower of the investment scene might expect, the list of those winners was dominated by stocks of companies that became the targets of takeover or buyout bids. Prominent examples: <ORGANIZATION> Murray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION>, up 175 percent; <PERSON> J.P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, 135 percent; <ORGANIZATION> Arkansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Best </ORGANIZATION>, 134 percent; <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, 131 percent; <PERSON> Varo </PERSON>, 130 percent; <ORGANIZATION> Payless </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cashways </ORGANIZATION>, 120 percent; <ORGANIZATION> Federated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION>, 119 percent; and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION>, 112 percent. While the overall averages posted gains for the first half of the year, there were some notable laggards as the market struggled to recover from the beating it took in the crash last fall. It was a test of patience for the 2.7 million-plus owners of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's most widely held stock, which closed June 30 at 26 -RCB-, down 0.9 percent from the end of 1987. <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T holders fared much better than did the many fans of <ORGANIZATION> Genentech </ORGANIZATION>, a high-flying leader in the promising field of biotechnology. <ORGANIZATION> Genentech </ORGANIZATION> shares fell some 35 percent to rank among the first half's biggest <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> percentage change losers, as investors went through a wrenching reappraisal of prospects for a <ORGANIZATION> Genentech </ORGANIZATION> drug used to treat heart-attack patients. Still harder times befell <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>, the loss-plagued toy and game manufacturer, whose stock fell more than 40 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> shares, which traded as high as $ 65 a share in 1983 when the company's Cabbage Patch Kids dolls were becoming a national craze, reached mid-1988 in the neighborhood of $ 2. Aside from such individual cases, the market has had trouble establishing any consistent themes so far in 1988. There was no standout strength, for example, either in stocks that would benefit the most from an increase in inflation or in issues that represent a `` disinflation'' play. Analysts said that betokened greater than usual confusion among investors over the direction in which the economy was headed. The year began amid widespread recession fears in the wake of Black Monday last Oct. 19. As it became clear that economic activity was running stronger than almost everybody had forecast, the concern shifted to a possible revival of inflation. By midyear, that scare seemed to have abated somewhat and, sure enough, talk was stirring again of a business slump in 1989. In a compilation by <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poor </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of the comparative performance of industry groups in the stock market through June 29, many of the winners drew their strength from takeover bids or battles that affected one or more of their component stocks: For example, textile products, up 65 percent, and department stores, up 49 percent. Notable among the worst performers were some health-care groups _ miscellaneous health care, down 30 percent, and medical products and supplies, down 3 percent _ and high-technology entries like computer software, down 11 percent, and electronic instruments, down 4 percent. For those investors who bet on revived inflation, gold mining stocks failed to pay off, falling nearly 5 percent.

<HEAD>Parents and Colleges Differ on Results of Aids Formula</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE>
<TEXT>
 College aid officers use a federal formula to determine each family's ability to pay and how much aid it's entitled to But as tuitions rise faster than available aid, the formula has n't quelled the growing number of disagreements between colleges and families over what each family can really afford.

 Each year, 6.5 million families seeking college aid must undergo a `` needs analysis.'' They fill out forms, supply tax information and generally bare their financial souls to college officials to make their case for grants or loans. But as a <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Wyo. </LOCATION>, mother and her chronically ill 18-year-old son are learning this summer, colleges and families may often differ sharply on what a family can really afford. A formula mandated by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is supposed to produce an objective assessment of each family's capacity to pay, with the college making up the difference with aid, either in direct grants or low-interest loans. Financial aid for families above the poverty line is likely to be double-edged, mainly loans that help families squeak through the college years but can leave a legacy of debt that strains middle-income budgets for a decade or more. Many families are stunned by their failure to qualify for good-sized grants and by the amount of debt they must take on. They fail to realize aid is based `` not on immediate liquidity, but on the capacity to pay over an extended period of time relative to other families,'' said <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Brouder </PERSON>, director of information of the <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scholarship </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, a branch of the <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> which processes financial aid forms. As tuitions have soared, borrowing for college has increased five-fold in the last decade. Since the mid-1970s, the loan proportion of all student aid grew from one-fifth to one-half. Federal statistics show average college debt after four years of private college is $ 8,950. At public colleges, it is $ 6,685. The term `` needs analysis'' itself may mislead many families, said <PERSON> Brouder </PERSON>, because the process does n't really measure need, but a family's capacity to pay and carry debt. That's small comfort to the woman from <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> as she considers an aid package from the University of <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, where her son hopes to enroll next fall. She must decide this month whether to accept the package _ after that, the school has told her it will withdraw its offer. `` I feel the system has me beat. The rules really hurt my class of people. Something has to change,'' said the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> woman, who agreed to discuss her finances in detail on condition of anonymity. `` I'm very confused and I'm very frustrated,'' she said. A divorced mother of three, she earns $ 19,760 as a medical typist at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, well above the federal poverty line of $ 11,203 for a family of four. The family's principal asset is a 1,000-square foot prefabricated home worth about $ 65,000. The family owns three cars, a 1971 <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, 1972 Dodge van and a 1974 <ORGANIZATION> Plymouth </ORGANIZATION>, and has cash savings of $ 1,071. To ease its budget, the only meat the family eats is moose and elk they hunt themselves. She gets no child support or alimony from her former husband, whom she divorced in 1981 after 12 years of marriage. Her son suffers from <PERSON> Crohn </PERSON>'s disease, a chronic, debilitating intestinal inflammation that has meant surgery, high medical bills and long periods where work or stress become dangerous. Total costs at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wyoming </ORGANIZATION> next fall, including tuition, fees, room and board, transportation and other expenses, will be $ 5,910 _ close to the national average of $ 5,789 for four-year public institutions. But even that relatively modest tuition would break her fragile budget, the mother fears. `` Has income kept up with tuition? By any realistic measure, no. And for most income groups, it's not even close,'' the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colleges </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Universities </ORGANIZATION> said in a recent publication. The university sent the family its first aid offer Feb. 26. The school would provide grants and low-interest, federally subsidized loans in the amount of $ 1,910 for the next school year. The mother would have to contribute $ 1,650, the son $ 2,350, for a total family contribution of $ 4,000 _ an amount equal to more than 20 percent of Mrs. <PERSON> Garrison </PERSON>'s pre-tax income. Under the federal formula, students getting aid are expected to contribute at least $ 700 toward tuition, barring health or other problems. `` I called the university in April. I said I ca n't be expected to come up with this money, and neither can my son. I asked what it would take for them to reconsider. Would a letter from my son's doctor help They said it might,'' she said. In June, the <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> specialist who treats her son wrote the school that the stress of a previous job at a fast-food restaurant `` may have had an adverse affect on the clinical course of his illness. In fact, if his <PERSON> Crohn </PERSON>'s disease flares up, he may not be able to work at all.'' On June 10, the university improved its offer. The mother would have to contribute $ 1,457 toward tuition. The son would still be required to contribute $ 859. The school would provide $ 550 in grants. To make up the balance, the school would make available $ 2,040 in federally guaranteed student loans at 8 percent interest and $ 1,000 more in national direct student loans at 5 percent. By the school's reckoning, its second offer of $ 3,590 in aid left an `` unmet need'' of $ 4. From the mother's point of view, it is far higher. The university's aid officials, for their part, say they are merely playing by rules set down in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. All college aid offices are subject to periodic government audits to ensure they are adhering to the federal formula for distributing financial aid. Schools may offer more or less than the formula calls for, but they must be prepared to justify and document their decisions. `` There is congressional methodology in arriving at aid, and we have no option but to follow it,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Nutter </PERSON>, interim director of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wyoming </ORGANIZATION>'s financial aid office. Beyond that, he declined to discuss the case. Parents can appeal to a university to reconsider an aid offer, as this mother did with partial success. Some parents even get a congressman or senator to lobby an aid officer for a better deal. Beyond that, a family has little choice but to accept a school's aid package, or try, if possible, to find a school more affordable Despite her dismay over the aid package, she expects to accept at least part of it, perhaps borrowing some from her mother instead of the federal government. `` It's important that somehow my son go to school,'' she said.

<TEXT>
 As millions of Americans hit the roads for summer vacation, burglars and other crooks go into action for one of their busiest seasons. Summer is one of the peak times for burglary, police statistics show, thanks to the combination of closed schools and absent vacationers. The insurance industry reports that most burglars turn out to be school-age young people. That means, of course, that most burglars are not professionals, just adolescents taking advantage of unguarded homes during their idle time. A few simple precautions can discourage most of them, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. Lots of companies are advertising complex and costly alarm systems, and many of them do a good job. They can turn on lights, set off noisy bells and sirens and even alert a central office or the police in the event someone tries to enter your home. Probably not everyone needs or can afford a high-tech system. But there are still things they can do to help protect the home. To begin with, lock doors and windows, including the attic, basement and garage. Sure, this sounds obvious. Yet police report that many burglars get into homes through doors and windows carelessly left unlocked. The insurance institute recommends deadbolt or double cylinder locks for doors, and notes that a variety of good, inexpensive window locks are on sale. In many areas, local police will do a free security audit of the home and make recommendations. When away, try to make the home look lived in, the institute says. For example, have someone mow the lawn, and ask a neighbor to collect the mail and newspapers instead of stopping delivery. The fewer people who know you're away, the better. Do not hide keys outside the home, burglars know where to look. Leave a key with a friend or neighbor who can check on the house from time to time. Get automatic timers for lights to keep the place looking lived in. Keep ladders out of sight and locked up. Valuable items should be locked in a safe deposit box or other secure storage. And, the insurers note, many home insurance policies have limits on the coverage for items such as jewelry, furs, silver and other valuables. If you have such property, an additional policy may be needed. If a urglar does break in, stereos, televisions and such are among the most popular items to steal. Permanently mark them in an inconspicuous place with initials, Social Security number or some other identifying mark. Often, police will lend an electric engraving tool for this purpose. With this mark, if police do recover the stolen items, you will be able to identify yours and get them back. When back from vacation, look for signs of burglary before entering the home. Surprising a burglar could be a deadly mistake. And while on the road, remember you are not immune from crime either. Be wary of pickpockets and setups, such as someone dropping a handful of change to distract you while an accomplice steals luggage or other property. Never leave luggage unattended, travel experts say, and always be wary of problems in crowded areas, especially if bumped or jostled. Wrap your wallet in rubber bands _ that makes it much harder to slip out of the pocket, suggests the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>. And women should carry the purse tucked securely under their arm. Some thieves have adopted the strategy of putting up signs that say `` Beware of Pickpockets,'' and watching people to see which pocket they check on viewing the sign.

 Actors are commonly typecast in certain roles, but <PERSON> Rebeca </PERSON> <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Perfect Strangers'' seems typecast by occupation. `` I play an airline stewardess on the show,'' she said. `` I was an airline stewardess on ` <PERSON> Newhart </PERSON>.' When I came to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> the first thing I did was ` <PERSON> Remington </PERSON> <PERSON> Steele </PERSON>.' I was a flight attendant. I've played a flight attendant on every show I've been on.'' Oddly, before she became an actress she was a private investigator. She specialized in finding missing persons and became so successful at it she became supervisor of a large office of detectives. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> plays <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Anne </PERSON>, no dumb blonde but perhaps too literal for her own good. She takes everyone and everything at face value, which makes her appear to be a little dizzy. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> and her roommate, <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON>, played by <PERSON> Melanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, are two stewardesses who are neighbors of <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Linn-Baker </PERSON> -RRB- and <LOCATION> Balki </LOCATION> -LRB- <PERSON> Bronson </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinchot </PERSON> -RRB-. Although they're not paired off, <PERSON> Balki </PERSON> does have a crush on <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> and <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> on <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON>. In the show, <PERSON> Balki </PERSON> is a naive sheepherder who has left his <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> home to live with his cousin in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. It's `` The Odd Couple'' with a cultural clash thrown in. <PERSON> Balki </PERSON>, in his own way, takes things as literally as <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Anne </PERSON>. `` The producers always want us in uniform, and <PERSON> Melanie </PERSON> and I are always begging not to wear those scratchy things,'' <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> said. `` On the last show we did we said we wanted to wear our pretty dresses. When we walked onto the set for rehearsal there were <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bronson </PERSON> in pretty dresses. We near fell down. `` The script had said, ` <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> enter and cross to the boys. They are in their pretty dresses.' It was ambiguous as to who was in the dresses, so they did it as a dig at us.'' <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON>'s role on the show began as a guest appearance. `` I was n't supposed to hang around this long,'' she said. `` I'd never been a regular on a show before I've worked on other comedies, but nothing ever this goofy. We have a lot of fun.'' At the audition, she read for the role of <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON>. `` The two characters are very different,'' she said, `` I did n't feel I was right for <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON>. I wanted to read for <PERSON> Rachel </PERSON>, which was <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Anne </PERSON>'s name in the first script. They never did let me read for the role I'm now playing.'' The original order for `` Perfect Strangers'' was for six shows. `` When I saw the promo for the show I said, ` There's another one that'll get canceled,''' <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> said. `` But it did well in the ratings and they got a pickup for 13. I was in the first show of the 13. Then I came back for the fifth show and I've been there ever since. `` <PERSON> Melanie </PERSON> and I did three shows without a contract. We thought each show would be our last. We were just a couple of neurotic actresses. Then they signed us. Now, <PERSON> Melanie </PERSON> and I are best friends and we're still neurotic.'' Although <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON>'s been on television only a short time, she already has an Emmy. But her Emmy is a toy poodle. `` I named her Emmy in case I never won one,'' she said. `` She's a little teacup and when I travel I put her into a bag and take her with me She's good about it, but after a six-hour flight she wants to run around and be silly.'' In her travels, she's often recognized, although most people ca n't put a name to the face. `` People will come up to me, touch me and say, ` Ai n't you that girl?''' she said. `` I do n't know. It depends on what ` that girl' did. `` Perfect Strangers'' has been out of production since last December, and with the continuing writers' strike it's uncertain when it will start filming again. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> did have a small role in the movie `` Scrooge,'' starring <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON>. `` The first day I was on the -LRB- movie -RRB- set was the first day of the strike,'' she said. `` The script needed some rewrites so we had to wing it. I was only on the picture for two days, but I got to dress up like a funky little Miss Santa Claus of 1968 and <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> my heinie. The joke was I give a copy to the character played by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Forsythe </PERSON>. `` I said I would n't do it unless I wore something. They offered me a G-string, but I wore boxer shorts.'' <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> grew up in <LOCATION> Cumberland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, and began her career in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. But unlike other aspiring actresses, she supported herself as a private investigator while waiting for her break. `` I'd find missing husbands and wives and runaway high school students,'' she said. `` It's real hard to disappear. I could usually find a missing person because they nearly always leave some trace. I talk a lot so people think I'm stupid and tell me everything. The money was good and they kept promoting me until I ended up a supervisor with a pink office.'' She quit after three years when she began getting better TV parts.

<HEAD>Productivity Doesn't Always Equate With Money Spent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Few indicators of future business activity are more closely watched than the amount of money earmarked for capital investment and research and development. But maybe, some folks are now saying, the attention is a bit overdone. The widespread, almost automatic assumption made is that money spent on new plants and equipment and in developing new products is an investment that returns itself many times over. Economists, political leaders, academics and others watch these items for other reasons as well. Such spending, for example, supposedly shows the level of confidence in the future, and it is equated with more efficient production. Now comes an authority on productivity who cautions against falling in love with such expenditures. Not that they are unimportant, says <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> <PERSON> Grayson </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>. But, he says, let us not lose our perspective. <PERSON> Grayson </PERSON>, probably best remembered as chairman of President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s price commission, has been studying productivity issues for the past decade, mainly as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Productivity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. Among other activities, he also served on President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s Commission on the Agenda for the'80s and was a member of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Productivity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Productivity is his specialty. From that background, he issues what is likely to be considered an almost sacrilegious criticism: `` Capital investment is not the principal cause of productivity growth nor of its slowdown.'' With <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Dell </PERSON>, vice president of the productivity center, <PERSON> Grayson </PERSON> has written `` American Business: A Two-Minute Warning,'' a volume examining the sometimes surprising relationship between capital investment and productivity. Such spending hardly correlates with increased productivity, for example. As they point out, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> productivity growth declined from 1965 to 1978 while capital investment increased during the same period. In fact, they say, `` capital investment may well be the result of growth, rather than its source _ better growth prospects attract more investment.'' The concentration on physical investment, on plants and equipment, also has led to a relative neglect of factors that are equally or even more important for productivity and quality improvement, <PERSON> Grayson </PERSON> and <PERSON> O'Dell </PERSON> say. They observe, for example, that investments in human capital, though not as often examined as physical investments, are especially important in improving quality and production. Can anyone deny that quality education does n't pay off? Those who place great faith in dollar amounts also might be misguided in another respect. <PERSON> Grayson </PERSON> and <PERSON> O'Dell </PERSON> observe that `` there is a difference between the volume of capital investment and the productivity of that investment.'' <PERSON> Grayson </PERSON> can speak on that subject both as an experienced hand and as an academic authority. Where, for example, is it more evident than in government that throwing money at a situation does not necessarily improve it? In this respect, the authors call attention to a concept that might not be correct for these times: Why do we still believe that long production runs, greater volume, big factories and automation mean greater productivity? They observe that `` the best American and Japanese firms have shown that it is often more productive to focus on less, not more: small batches, small inventories, and flexibile, simple machines.'' They have a special message for politicans and government officials: `` Among the more important things government at all levels could do are improve education, privatize more government services, improve the collections and reporting of competitiveness statistics, improve productivity in government and cut the budget deficit.'' That, not just money, is bound to improve productivity, they say.

<HEAD>Volatility Marks First Half Of '88; Economists More Bullish For

 If the first half of 1988 is any indication of what the rest of the year will be like for bonds and interest rates, better hang on to your hats now. `` Anybody who survived the first half of'88 had to have had their seatbelt on,'' said <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Kellner </PERSON>, chief economist for <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` The market was extremely volatile.'' Bonds started out the year on a strong note, with interest rates continuing to decline following last fall's stock market crash. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> had relaxed its credit policies on the widespread belief the crash might affect spending habits and push the economy into a recession. And declining oil prices also played an important role in dampening any inflation concerns. But as the economy showed surprising resilience, interest rates started to climb again and bonds lost their luster. Concern turned to the possibility of higher inflation and the interest-rate outlook overseas along with the dollar's instability in foreign exchange. Those factors continue to plague the credit markets, although rates have eased lately on the recent strength of the dollar. A firm <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency makes dollar-denominated bonds and notes more attractive to foreigners and lessens the prospects of higher inflation, which erodes the value of fixed-income securities. `` If you're a bond trader and you made money in the first six months of the year, then you were a superstar,'' said <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldinger </PERSON>, who runs the <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, investment banking firm <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` Most of us ended up about even.'' `` The interesting thing is that with all the ups and down we've had, we have n't changed all that much,'' noted <PERSON> Maury </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, chief economist for <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION> Bond prices and yields right now are about where they were at the start of the year. For instance, the yield on the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s 30-year bond, the most widely-watched issue in the credit markets, stood at 8.93 percent on Jan. 4. On the last day of June it was 8.85 percent, down from 8.92 percent in the previous session. And the <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Bond Index, which measures price movements on all outstanding <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> issues with maturities of a year or longer, looked at the end of June like it had barely budged from early January. In the intervening months, however, prices and yields proceeded on a veritable roller-coaster ride. The 30-year bond, which peaked at 10.4 percent the day of the market crash last October, tumbled to a low of 8.29 percent on Feb. 5 and jumped to a high of 9.35 percent on May 23. Commercial lending rates followed suit. Major banks lowered their prime lending rates _ used to set rates on most corporate and consumer loans _ a quarter of a percentage point to 8.5 percent on Feb. 2, then raised them to 9 percent on May 11. Mortgage rates followed a similar pattern. For a conventional 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, rates ranged from a low of 9.84 percent in mid-February to a high of 10.58 percent in late May and early June, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The confusion in the marketplace scared away some municipal and corporate issuers. For the first six months, the volume of municipal issues totaled $ 52.76 billion, compared with $ 58.13 billion a year ago. The volume of corporate issues fell to $ 141.4 billion from $ 157 billion in 1987. `` Right now, sentiment is cautiously bullish,'' based largely on the dollar's recent strength, said <PERSON> Kellner </PERSON> of Manufacturers Hanover. But he said bond investors are keeping an eye on the Midwestern drought and what effects that might have on food prices and inflation _ although most economists say the drought's impact probably wo n't be felt until the beginning of next year. Some economists predict a drop in interest rates for the remainder of 1988, based in part on the declining oil market, the firmer dollar and the feeling that the economy eventually will run out of steam. But as <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> concedes, what happened in the first half of 1988 `` goes to show how difficult it is to predict.''

<HEAD>Latest Insider Trading Case Turns Spotlight on Foreign-Based Scams</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s biggest insider-trading case since the <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> scandal, with money trails stretching from <LOCATION> Wall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> to secretive Swiss banks to teeming <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, shows how globalized markets can spawn bold schemers who are n't necessarily deterred by tough <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> securities laws, experts say. The <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which polices the nation's stock and bond markets, has obtained increased cooperation from overseas governments in conducting investigations of foreign-based fraud over the past few years. But many governments remain reluctant to comply with <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> requests for help, and a few express hostility and resentment, providing a convenient shield for foreign insider traders in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> securities. In some countries, the use of non-public information to profit in the financial markets is perfectly acceptable. `` The world is not in any kind of agreement that insider trading is a heinous crime,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoppelman </PERSON>, a securities law attorney in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and former chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> task force on investigation rules. `` Some of these countries think we're crazy to enforce these laws.'' Obtaining cooperation from foreign governments is an important part of the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>'s case against <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong-based </LOCATION> businessman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> junior analyst <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, accused co-conspirators in a scheme to profit on inside information about impending corporate takeovers. A complaint, filed last Monday in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, demanded the pair return $ 19 million in alleged illicit profits plus triple penalties for a total of $ 76 million. That amount is second only to the record $ 100 million in profits and penalties the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> seized from insider trader <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> in November 1986. Although <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> investigators gathered much of the evidence against <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the key break came when they questioned <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, for which they needed cooperation from the British colony's government. `` The fact they were taking testimony in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> suggests the commission is much further along than a couple of years ago in getting active and passive assistance of other law enforcement authorities,'' said <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Flannery </PERSON>, a New York-based securities lawyer who used to work for the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>. `` Agencies like the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>, which are quasi-criminal in nature, do n't conduct inquiries without foreign help,'' she said. Besides the <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> connection, the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> also has disclosed a Swiss link in the Wang-Lee probe. Commission Chairman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON>, testifying at a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> hearing this past week, said the commission was negotiating with <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>'s government for information about Swiss bank accounts controlled by <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> and a possible freeze of assets in those accounts In addition, <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> enforcement chief <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> disclosed at the same hearing that the commission is pursuing about 50 investigations involving foreign trading, with sums ranging from $ 40,000 to `` some very large amounts.'' <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> officials attribute the growth of these investigations largely to the increasing relationships between markets, which now make it possible to easily trade <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stocks in cities ranging from <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>. A foreign-based investor with inside information about an American company can make profitable trades halfway around the world. As a result, <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> said in a telephone interview, `` There's more of an acceptance of the notion that a person who affects transactions in the securities market of a particular country should comply with the laws of that country regardless of where they happen to live.'' For example, the Swiss have become increasingly cooperative, securities experts say. <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, which once routinely dismissed queries about ownership of financial assets, now has an independent commission that oversees <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> requests for help. Moreover, a new law took effect Friday in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> that makes insider trading a criminal offense. The measure will make it easier for the Swiss to assist the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>. Other countries historically have rejected the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>'s requests for information and continue to do so, partly out of sovereignty principles. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Liechtenstein </LOCATION>, for example, are considered notoriously uncooperative. Sen. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reigle </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Mich., has sponsored a bill aimed at making it easier for the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> to investigate foreign-based insider trading The bill would allow the commission to investigate on behalf of foreign governments, which would be expected to reciprocate. Nevertheless, such legislation would not compel other countries to adopt U.S.-style prohibitions against insider trading, which remains a fundamental problem as international securities markets grow in complexity and scope. `` I do n't think they're going to buy all our concepts of securities fraud,'' <PERSON> Stoppelman </PERSON> said. `` Just because it seems morally unacceptable, that does n't mean the whole world agrees with us.''

<HEAD>Rising Demand, Drought Fears Keep Pushing Sugar Prices Higher</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Rising demand from the Far East has helped push sugar futures prices to 6 -LCB- - year highs, and analysts say the Midwestern drought has sparked an increase in bullish speculation that could drive prices higher still On the other hand, any hint that the rally is running of steam could send the market plunging as nervous traders on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Coffee, <ORGANIZATION> Sugar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> scurry to take profits _ or cut their losses, experts say Sugar prices have risen steadily since bottoming out at about 2.75 cents a pound in mid-1985 when world stockpiles stood at record highs. Growing demand and declining production have gradually reduced the surplus until it now stands just above the critically low level of 30 percent of the anticipated 1988-89 demand, according to <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Weissman </PERSON> <PERSON> Ganes </PERSON>, an analyst with the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. In contrast to the slow, steady gains during much of the past 3 years, sugar prices for near-month delivery have skyrocketed in the last two months, from about 8 cents a pound at the end of April to more than 13 cents a pound at the end of June. Moves by <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> during the past year to increase the availability of sugar in that country has had a profound impact on the market, said <PERSON> Erik </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunlaevy </PERSON>, a trader with New York-based commodities and brokerage firm <ORGANIZATION> Balfour </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maclaine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` Basically, the government of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> decided to let the Chinese fulfill their desires for sugar,'' he said. `` They decentralized the purchasing to a certain extent, so you have different entities buying sugar instead of one central purchasing agency.'' He said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> ordinarily buys its sugar from <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and other exporters in the Eastern Hemisphere. But the increased demand from the Chinese has forced those producers to raise their prices, prompting <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and other Far Eastern consumer nations to shop for lower-priced sugar in the West. Caribbean nations supply much of the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION>'s sugar, and <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> sugar is traditionally the type that gets delivered on the Coffee, <ORGANIZATION> Sugar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Dunlaevy </PERSON> said. Thus, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s increased demand is largely responsible for the sharp rise in sugar futures prices Exacerbating the situation is the drought, which threatens to substantially reduce yields of sugar beets in the <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> region of <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, analysts said. `` That's the largest beet crop in this country, so the beet crop here could be down 500,000 to 700,000 tons,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Oxnard </PERSON>, vice president of commodities trading for <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Clifton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> `` On a worldwide basis, that's not a huge number but it's a further drawdown in stocks,'' he said. The drought has also increased bullish speculation in sugar futures, just as it has in virtually every other market for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agricultural products. `` I know there are traders who have one eye on soybeans and one eye on sugar and when beans go up, they buy sugar,'' <ORGANIZATION> Oxnard </ORGANIZATION> said. `` To some degree all these markets have just piggybacked on top of each other.'' One measure of market speculation is `` open interest,'' the number of buy or sell orders that have not been canceled out by an offsetting order. Since late April, open interest in sugar futures has expanded from less than 130,000 to nearly 170,000. `` A large part of the open interest is speculative in nature, representing a lot of fund and commission-house speculators,'' Ms. <PERSON> Ganes </PERSON> said. Although many analysts, including Ms. <PERSON> Ganes </PERSON>, expect sugar prices to climb higher in the near term, they acknowledged that prices could also fall very rapidly. `` If the market does show signs of weakening, -LRB- speculators -RRB- will be fairly quick at taking a profit and that could result in a sharp turn in the market,'' Ms. <PERSON> Ganes </PERSON> said. `` The people who got in at the higher levels are going to be quicker to get out, and that could exaggerate the correction.''

<HEAD>Cheaper Oil a Tonic for Inflation Fears</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Wall Street's inflation-watchers are counting on cheaper oil to take the sting out of rising food prices in the months ahead. World oil prices have fallen sharply of late amid signs that oil-exporting countries are producing faster than market demand can absorb. West Texas Intermediate crude oil, widely used as an overall gauge of the trend in oil prices, dropped below $ 15 a barrel Friday to its lowest level since 1986. That news, together with some rainfall at last in the parched Farm Belt, has encouraged talk in the financial markets that inflation might not be as bad as had been feared in the second half of 1988. One of the most reliable barometers of inflationary expectations, the yield on 30-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds, has fallen from a peak of nearly 9.5 percent several weeks ago to less than 9 percent in recent days. The drought watch continues on <LOCATION> Wall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>, of course, even as it does in the areas of the country that suffer most directly from the lack of moisture. While the current weather charts showed rain in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> this past week, traders in the futures and financial markets switched their attention to forecasts suggesting more unusually dry conditions in the next few weeks. For the national economy, however, many analysts say it is necessary to keep the role of agricultural commodities in perspective. `` Although the drought could be the worst in nearly a century, it should be kept in mind that the importance of raw food commodities has changed dramatically over the years, and the impact of sharp price rises in this area is not particularly great on consumer spending or the inflation indices,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON>, analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> David </PERSON> A <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> and <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Chappaqua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, economic forecasting team, say they have no desire the minimize the distress the drought is causing for farmers and other businesses in agricultural areas. However, they add, `` the drought will indeed increase the prices of many foods but have limited impact on inflation. Food and beverages account for less than 18 percent of the Consumer Price Index.'' Furthermore, they add, rising food prices actually can serve to depress prices of many non-food items. `` As food prices accelerate this year, non-food stores, especially those competing for consumers' discretionary income, will lose some sales. Price-cutting will be more frequent. `` This deflationary effect will substantially reduce the overall impact of the drought on the CPI to about half a percent.'' Despite such assurances, the stock market's early-summer rally bogged down in the past week. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 11.38 to 2,131.58, ending a five-week winning streak. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> composite index dropped .88 to 153.68; the <ORGANIZATION> NASDAQ </ORGANIZATION> composite index for the over-the-counter market rose 3.08 to 394.70, and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> market value index was up .51 at 309.00. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> averaged 208.42 million shares a day, against 170.99 million the week before. Like the drought, the decline in the price of oil is cause for serious concern in some already beleaguered areas of the country. But unlike the dry weather, cheaper oil can be seen as a distinct plus for such broad economic forces as nationwide consumer spending. `` This recent drop in oil prices reminds us of the drop back in early 1986 when the Dow Jones industrials were rallying and had moved above 1,700,'' said <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Donnaruma </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Albany </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> `` At that time no one liked the rally and everyone was looking for a correction. We get the same feeling now. `` Can the rally in stocks, bonds and the dollar all be related to the drop in crude oil prices? Probably not entirely _ but for our money, watching the price of oil is better than watching the stars.''

<HEAD>Economy Accelerating, Purchasing Managers Survey Indicates</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The economy expanded at a healthy pace in June as production and new orders at the nation's manufacturers surged, according to a survey of purchasing executives released Monday. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Purchasing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>, which conducts a monthly survey of economic trends at more than 250 industrial companies, said its index of economic growth soared to 59.3 percent in June from 55.1 percent in May. A reading above 50 percent indicates the economy is expanding, while levels below that point generally indicate the economy is contracting. The June increase was fueled by an improvement in new orders and production, the association said. Thirty-four percent of the purchasing managers questioned in the survey said their companies had more new orders in June, compared to 30 percent in May. Fifty-four percent _ unchanged from the May results _ said new orders were the same. Twelve 12 percent, down from 16 percent the previous month, said the number of new orders fell. A sharply higher number of purchasing managers reported an improvement in production, with 35 percent saying production was up, 53 percent saying it was the same and 12 percent saying it was down. In May, 27 percent said production had improved, 62 percent said it was the same and 11 percent said it declined. Another indication of an improvement in the economy came in a slowdown in vendor deliveries, which signals that the demand for materials is outstripping the ability of manufacturers to fill orders. In June, 32 percent of the managers said deliveries were slower, up sharply from May's 19 percent.
