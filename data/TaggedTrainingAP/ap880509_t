 A federal court jury convicted a woman Monday of killing her husband and another woman by lacing their Extra-Strength Excedrin with cyanide in the nation's first trial in a death by product tampering. The 12-member jury deliberated almost five days before returning the verdict against <PERSON> Stella </PERSON> <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>. One juror held out for acquittal until the final vote, said the jury foreman, <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>, 55, Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>, 44, of suburban <ORGANIZATION> Auburn </ORGANIZATION>, was convicted on each count she faced, two of causing death by tampering with a product involved in interstate commerce and three of tampering. The first two counts could result in life sentences. King County Prosecutor <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> Maleng </PERSON> said he would wait until after sentencing, scheduled for June 17, to decide whether to file state murder charges. When the verdict was read by the clerk, Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> bowed her head. The charges stemmed from the June 1986 deaths of her husband, <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>, 52, and of Sue <PERSON> Katherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Snow </PERSON>, 40, also of <LOCATION> Auburn </LOCATION>. Both died after ingesting the poisoned painkillers. The deaths touched off a nationwide tampering scare and prompted Excedrin manufacturer <ORGANIZATION> Bristol-Myers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> to recall its capsuled, non-prescription medications. Seven people died in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> in 1982 from cyanide-laced Extra-Strength Tylenol, but those deaths remain unsolved. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Weisberg </PERSON>, spokesman for the New York-based Bristol-Myers, said the company was `` gratified by the jury's verdict, and particularly appreciative of the efforts of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and other law enforcment authorities. `` Product tampering is intolerable to society. When it occurs every effort must be made to identify those responsible and to bring them to justice,'' he said. `` We're very pleased it's finally over. It was a tough case for the jury to decide,'' said Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Joanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Maida </PERSON>, who said she would ask for an `` appropriately severe'' sentence. She did not elaborate. Ms. <PERSON> Maida </PERSON> said she hoped `` it will be a deterrent'' to future drug-tamperers. During the trial, Ms. <PERSON> Maida </PERSON> portrayed Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> as an `` icy, hard human being,'' unhappy in her marriage and beset by financial problems, and accused Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> of poisoning her husband to collect on his life insurance policies. Ms. Snow was an innocent stranger caught in Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>'s scheme to make her husband's death appear random, the prosecutor said But federal public defender <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hillier </PERSON> said Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> was the victim of a daughter who lied when she said her mother had discussed killing <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> with a drug overdose or by hiring a hit man. The prosecution said Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> put tainted painkillers on shelves of local stores to make her husband's death appear random and to lead doctors, who had concluded <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> died of emphysema, to the true cause of his death. Only Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> had the motive, opportunity and ability to commit the crimes, Ms. <PERSON> Maida </PERSON> told the jury in closing arguments May 2. <PERSON> Hillier </PERSON> called Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>'s daughter, <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, 28, unreliable and noted that pharmaceutical companies had offered a $ 300,000 reward to anyone who provided information leading to an arrest. Further, the prosecution could not link Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> to cyanide purchases, <PERSON> Hillier </PERSON> said. Earlier Monday, a juror said she had received an anonymous phone call Friday in which the caller asked, `` Do n't you all know that she failed the lie detector test?'' Information about the polygraph test had been kept from the jury, but <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Dwyer </PERSON> said neither the panel's trouble reaching a decision nor the phone call would force a mistrial. He gave <PERSON> Hillier </PERSON> a choice of substituting an alternate juror for the one who received the phone call, but <PERSON> Hillier </PERSON> declined. Ms. <PERSON> Maida </PERSON> said in her closing arguments that Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>'s plan failed because she was careless in mixing the poisonous capsules, greedy for insurance benefits and owned two of the five tainted bottles of painkillers found. The odds of one person buying two bottles of cyanide-laced pain capsules at different stores on different days were `` astronomical,'' Ms. <PERSON> Maida </PERSON> said, noting that more than 15,000 bottles had been examined in the <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> area. Ms. <PERSON> Maida </PERSON> also told jurors that Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> might have gotten away with the scheme if she had been more careful about the bowl she chose for mixing the potassium cyanide with Anacin and Excedrin painkillers. Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>, a tropical fish enthusiast, used a bowl contaminated with Algae Destroyer, a compound used to clean fish tanks, the prosecution alleged. Traces of the compound were found in the five tainted bottles of Excedrin and Anacin, Ms. <PERSON> Maida </PERSON> said. Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> also tripped up in leaving fingerprints on library books about poisons and cyanide, Ms. <PERSON> Maida </PERSON> said. But Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> testified she did the library research to find out more about her husband's death and to protect children from dangerous foliage around her rural home.

<TEXT>
 Socialist President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> has been a prominent face on the French left since the end of World War II, but in recent years he has moved markedly to the political center. His first two years in office, 1981-83, involved implementation of long-held Socialist ideas and were largely a failure. The radical philosophy of `` rupture with capitalism'' foundered on the rocks of economic reality. After trying to spend their way to prosperity, the Socialists succeeded only in running up the national debt without being able to stop runaway unemployment. In the face of a growing crisis, the government was forced to reverse course and institute austerity. When the right ousted the Socialists from control of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> in March 1986, <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> needed to appeal to a wider electorate if he was to have any hope of re-election. Ironically, after <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>'s popularity had fallen to historic lows at mid-term, it soared after the right regained control of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, leaving him with little real power in domestic affairs. The French seemed to like the balance of power. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, 71, quickly assumed the role of the wise grandfather, referred to affectionately by many as `` Tonton,'' a child's term for `` uncle.'' <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> was first elected May 10, 1981, in a Socialist tidal wave that ousted center-right President <PERSON> Valery </PERSON> <PERSON> Giscard </PERSON> d'Estaing and then, a month later, the conservatives and centrists who had held power in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> for 23 years. The founder of the modern <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> has now made four presidential races. He was defeated by <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaulle </PERSON> in 1965 and by <PERSON> Giscard </PERSON> in 1974. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> was born Oct. 26, 1916 in <LOCATION> Jarnac </LOCATION> in western <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. He earned degrees in law and letters in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. He was drafted in 1938, and during the German invasion of May 1940 was shot and captured. He escaped from a POW camp in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and returned to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. After the occupation of the Vichy zone by the Germans, he created a Resistance network. His career-long feud with Gen. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaulle </PERSON> began during the war when <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> refused to join his Resistance group with <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaulle </PERSON>'s. It was during his Resistance days that he met <PERSON> Danielle </PERSON> <PERSON> Gouze </PERSON>, whom he married in 1944 shortly after the liberation. During the chaotic postwar <LOCATION> Fourth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> held 11 Cabinet posts, including interior and justice minister. In the early 1970s, <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> took the moribund <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and built it into a major force. But the Union of the Left he forged with the Communists fell apart in 1977. It was not until the final days of the 1981 presidential election that the two major leftist parties again joined to defeat <PERSON> Giscard </PERSON> and oust the conservatives. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> shocked much of the West when he brought the Communists into his government. But that union only lasted three years, until 1984, when the Communists pulled out in a dispute over economic policy.

<HEAD>Arms Control, NATO Issues on Tap in Senate</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is facing fights over arms control and <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> this week as it considers both a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget bill and the historic U.S.-Soviet treaty eliminating medium-range nuclear weapons. First, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> will begin work on the military budget, an annual fight which generally involves wide-ranging decisions on <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s far-flung commitments. The bill approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> authorizes $ 299.5 billion for the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, and targets increased spending for non-nuclear weapons in the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. `` This issue of conventional weapons in <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> is something that we paid an awful lot of attention to this year, given the treaty,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., chairman of the panel He was referring to the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty signed Dec. 8 by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. It eliminates both nations' medium-range missiles, and <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> and other supporters say <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s non-nuclear defenses will have to be bolstered after the missiles are gone. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is tentatively scheduled to begin work on the treaty Wednesday. During the Pentagon bill debate, amendments are likely both to increase spending for <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and call on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allies in the 16-nation alliance to pay more of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s costs. Also expected are proposals providing advice to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> from both conservative Republicans and liberal Democrats about the arms control policies he should follow in the last six months of his administration. Similar attempts were made the past two weeks in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> during that chamber's work on its version of the Pentagon budget bill. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved nuclear arms control restrictions opposed by the administration, along with cuts in Star Wars missile defense spending which were so deep that <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> threatened to advise <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to veto the bill. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> is expected to give final approval Wednesday to its Pentagon bill. Similar action by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> will send the separate measures to a <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> conference committee to reconcile the differences. Both measures propose $ 299.5 billion for the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> in the fiscal year starting Oct. 1. One difference is that the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted $ 3.5 billion for the <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Initiative </ORGANIZATION>, as Star Wars is formally known, while the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill proposes $ 4.6 billion. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> wanted $ 4.8 billion. The House also voted to order <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to send the military into the fight against illegal drug traffickers. Anti-drug amendments are likely in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> although not as sweeping as the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> proposal, <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said. In mid-week, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is scheduled to turn to the INF pact, which <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> wants ratified before he goes to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> on May 29 for his fourth summit meeting with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. With 67 votes needed for ratification, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leaders have predicted that 90 or more senators will vote to approve the pact. But the debate over the treaty has been clouded by a dispute over whether both the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the Soviets agree on several points, such as the definition of `` weapons'' and whether the pact bans `` futuristic'' weapons such as lasers. There also are questions about the latitude which will be allowed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> inspectors who will be stationed inside the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to verify compliance. While the focus on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor is on national security issues, congressional leaders also are preparing to send <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> the omnibus trade bill. The measure has been passed by both the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> but instead of being sent to the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, it remains stalled on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> while leaders seek to revise it and perhaps avert a threatened presidential veto. Last week, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted 253-159 to drop the bill's curbs on export of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> oil, one of two provisions <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has said would justify a veto. The other is a requirement that companies with 100 employees or more give 60 days' notice of plant closings and large layoffs. The measure approved by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> is a technical resolution. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leaders still are trying to get the technical resolution onto the floor without undue delay. If they can not, they probably will abandon plans to drop the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> provisions and just send the bill to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> unchanged from the form in which it won final passage two weeks ago.

<TEXT>
 A political mess has raised doubts about the future of democracy in this important <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ally and put the dreaded word `` coup'' on the lips of just about everyone _ from the president on down. However, the military has vowed to let democracy unravel its own tangles, and most people said they were betting against military intervention. Coup rumors have circulated since a week ago, when a dispute over control of the legislature prevented effective installation of the 60-member congress elected March 20. President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> told journalists Thursday: `` Yes, we are in the midst of a crisis.'' But he added, `` I believe the armed forces are absolutely convinced that this -LRB- a coup -RRB- would be a fatal course for the country because every coup implies a division in the armed forces ... and in the middle of a war that would mean a gigantic danger for national security.'' Leftist rebels are fighting U.S.-backed government forces in an 8-year-old war that has claimed an estimated 65,000 lives. Thirty deputies of the rightist <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, or <PERSON> Arena </PERSON>, took their seats May 1 and claim to constitute the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. The governing <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, including <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>, contend that <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> lacks the majority necessary to install the congress and make laws. The Christian Democrats were resoundingly defeated in the legislative election, losing their parliamentary majority. `` Right now, the country has no legislature,'' <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rey </PERSON> <PERSON> Prendes </PERSON> said at a news conference May 2. He is the party's candidate in presidential elections set for March. The two main parties, along with the smaller <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conciliation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, spent the end of last week trying to negotiate an end to the impasse, but they failed. Positions appeared to have hardened. The Christian Democrats and the <ORGANIZATION> Conciliation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, who claim 30 deputies between them, have formed an informal alliance to block <PERSON> Arena </PERSON>'s control of the legislature. One of the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>' 23 deputies is claimed by <PERSON> Arena </PERSON>, which charges the seat was stolen through electoral fraud. That dispute is before the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, but the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> do not recognize its jurisdiction in the matter. Government, opposition and military representatives have said the governmental crisis could deepen if the court rules for <PERSON> Arena </PERSON>, granting it a 31st seat and an outright majority. <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> says the Assembly has 59 members meanwhile and that it already has a majority with 30 votes. The Christian Democrats, in a parallel session, have seated the disputed deputy in defiance of the court. Meanwhile, the military has watched warily from the sidelines. Col. <PERSON> Mauricio </PERSON> <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON>, chief of operations of the joint chiefs of staff, said military intervention would do much more harm than good. `` Nationally, it would be the rupture of the democratic process,'' he said. `` Internationally, it would mean isolation that would bring major repercussions. And to break the democratic system would be to provide justification for the guerrillas' position that we do n't want democracy in this country.'' <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> receives more <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid than any country in the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION>. Last year's economic and military assistance was about $ 620 million. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has repeatedly held up <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> as an example of Central American democracy. Military intervention presumably would bring strong <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bipartisan reaction and possibly a drastic cut in aid. Though a coup appears unlikely, a top government source close to the president said the military is exerting strong pressure on politicians to resolve the impasse. The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the armed forces had `` imposed a deadline'' but declined to give details. Gen. <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Blandon </PERSON>, head of the joint chiefs of staff, said last week: `` This -LRB- dispute -RRB- confuses things and is not beneficial to the democratic process. It is irresponsible behavior on the part of the deputies in whom the people deposited their trust.'' <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarenga </PERSON>, named by <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> as the new president of the <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, agreed that damage had already been done: `` This mess leads the people to the conclusion, which is logical but not necessarily correct, that the guerrillas are right when they say our democracy does not work and is not the way to resolve our problems.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is reviewing a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> literacy test for would-be law enforcement officers that is failed by three out of four blacks and two out of three Hispanics. The federal inquiry is intended to determine whether the test discriminates against minorities seeking jobs in nearly 300 <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> law enforcement agencies. Minority groups tend to be underrepresented in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> law enforcement, and critics say hiring practices may contribute to the prevalence of white faces in blue uniforms. If the department concludes that the test is discriminatory, `` we'd have to take appropriate steps to address that problem,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Burstion-Wade </PERSON>. The test indicates whether a job candidate reads and writes at high-school level, skills presumed necessary if the candidate is to understand the laws being enforced. One section requires the person to complete a sentence by picking the correctly spelled word from three choices. Other sections test grammar. Another section asks the test taker to choose the clearest of three sentences discussing the same topic. The wrong answers contain `` extremely basic, obvious ambiguities,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Boatright </PERSON>, an attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> Officer Standards and Education. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has looked at numerous other state, city or county writing or reading tests for their effect on minorities, and employment criteria for physical strength and agility and their effect on women. Exams reviewed by the agency have ranged from the <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, county police test to the <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> toll facilities police force's height and weight restrictions. In <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, during the past 7 -LCB- months, passing rates were 69 percent for whites; 67 percent for <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION>; 59 percent for Asian-Americans; 36 percent for Hispanics; and 27 percent for blacks. Overall, 55 percent of the people who took the test between Sept. 1, 1987, and April 21 passed it, according to the law enforcement standards commission. People who fail may repeat the exam. As of Feb. 17, the state had 41,916 licensed law enforcement officers, 7.3 percent of whom were black, according to the most recent figures from the commission. Figures from the 1980 census show 12 percent of Texans are black. The commission had the test developed in the mid-1970s and used <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> criteria in drafting it. `` We offered to run it by the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> and they refused,'' said attorney <PERSON> Boatright </PERSON>. `` We're perfectly happy that they're looking at it now.'' One of the 283 law enforcement agencies using the test is <LOCATION> Lufkin </LOCATION>. Police Chief <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> says he does n't fault the exam for the absence of black officers on his force, although blacks make up about one-fourth of the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> town's population of 30,000. <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> says basic literacy is essential for an officer, and to help prepare candidates he has enlisted the help of an adult learning center which offers preparation for the high school General Equivalency Diploma exam. The local agency is offering a six-week course to raise reading comprehension and writing skills up to five grade levels, <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> said. `` We want black officers,'' <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> said. `` We would have a better rapport with the black community if we had black officers out there serving them.'' Only one black out of 13 passed the test in <LOCATION> Lufkin </LOCATION> in June, when it was offered last. The person who passed was a reporter who took the exam as part of a news assignment for the <ORGANIZATION> Lufkin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>.

 Democratic front-runner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> says he `` would n't know a horoscope from a telescope,'' but he decided to see what the stars had in store for him after reading reports President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s schedule has been affected by advice his wife gets from an astrologist <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told a crowd at a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> fund-raiser last week that his horoscope for that day indicated he would be taking on new challenges and having to make tough decisions. `` It is pointless for you to remain in your current position,'' the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor read, drawing giggles. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he also decided to check the horoscope of Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, whose legal troubles draw frequent gibes from <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> during campaign appearances. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s horoscope, the candidate said, indicated that he should find happiness `` elsewhere.'' `` I'll drink to that,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said as the crowd roared in approval.

 <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is not generally known for his humor.

Minutes later, asked if the mine was the first place he had campaigned where there was not a <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> restaurant, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor smiled and said: `` There are <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> restaurants everywhere.'' Fellow Greek and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> confidant <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitropoulis </PERSON> chimed in: `` And if there is n't one, there will be soon.'' Going out of the mine, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> mistakenly turned toward a vein heading deeper into the mountain.

 Tarmac football is the latest craze in the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> presidential campaign.

 Only a handful of television viewers witnessed one of the best ads of the 1988 presidential campaign _ 10 seconds of <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> stuffing pizza into his mouth at a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> eatery. `` It got on the air one day before he withdrew,'' said <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON>, <PERSON> Haig </PERSON>'s media consultant. The ad showed a mischievous-looking <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> using his fingers to subdue some errant pizza cheese, and instantly turned the off-putting general into a likable human being. Political media observers, from academics to admakers, say few if any TV spots this year have broken new technical ground or connected emotionally with voters. Among the notable exceptions was Democrat <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s `` $ 48,000 <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION>'' spot _ a trade tirade aimed at Korean tariffs that price <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> autos out of the Korean market `` The populist impulses in the <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> ad, the defiant expression, identified with the electorate's feeling of powerlessness,'' said <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> <PERSON> Jamieson </PERSON>, a professor and author of two books on political ads and speeches. `` It was a moment of empowerment. It let the voters feel good.'' <PERSON> Jamieson </PERSON> also nominated the pizza ad, saying it forced the viewer to reconsider <PERSON> Haig </PERSON>'s somewhat negative and militaristic image. The clear message was that `` if you knew him, you'd like him,'' she said. The short spot shows <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> with a piece of cheese hanging between his mouth and his pizza slice. He pulls it up to his mouth with his finger, realizes he's on-camera, and winks. Meanwhile, a narrator is saying with mock seriousness, `` Former Secretary of State <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Haig </PERSON>. The man with the best credentials of anyone to be president, who's also a lot more like you than you think. Vote for him.'' Also on the air for only one day was another favorite _ a <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> ad questioning whether <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had left any legacy in the numerous jobs he has held. The ad depicts a man's shadow walking across a virgin expanse of snow, crunching as he goes, yet leaving no mark. `` After 20 years of walking in the footsteps of giants, is n't it odd that <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has left no footprints at all?'' a narrator asks. `` It's almost like he was never there.'' `` That was the most effective line he had going. It was a good ad. It had the ring of truth and it was appealing,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabato </PERSON>, a professor, analyst and author. But <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, coasting on his <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> victory, did n't use the ad in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. Nor did the campaign carry out plans to reshoot it in the sand for use in Southern Super Tuesday states. It aired once in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, snow and all, then was pulled. `` They were believing the press clippings that they were on the way to the nomination,'' said <PERSON> Sabato </PERSON>. `` I almost think <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> thought it was time for healing -LRB- after <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> -RRB-. And he was trying to lower that negative of being too harsh.'' Other effective ads included <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s attack on <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for promoting Belgian endive as a remedy for farm woes, and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> ads mocking <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s populist message and flip-flops on issues. <PERSON> Jamieson </PERSON> makes a case for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>'s standard biographical ad _ a fast-paced montage of photographs that begins and ends with the printed words, `` A president for the 90s.'' It is being used virtually everywhere and has been the only <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> ad on the air in several states. `` It suggests solidity and stability and puts in place basic premises about what he's done,'' <PERSON> Jamieson </PERSON> said. `` It's not the funniest, it's not the glitziest, but it is the most effective except for the <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> ad.'' <PERSON> Haig </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> won nominations for the worst TV spots of the campaign season, as did the information-packed <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> ads produced by <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Garth </PERSON> for the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary. `` The <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> spots in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> were awful, disgraceful. They were just tepid. I felt they were very poorly communicating <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s message,'' said <PERSON> Sabato </PERSON> <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> was skewered for visual gimmickry and amateurish production. <PERSON> Jamieson </PERSON> cited one spot in which `` he rotates like a statue and you see his squared-off jaw and he looks straight into the camera. I expected it to be an ad for aftershave.'' <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> `` looks very strange'' in many of his ads, <PERSON> Jamieson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Haig </PERSON>'s initial ads `` made him appear rather evil. They emphasized his harsh nature,'' said <PERSON> Sabato </PERSON>. The early <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> ads tried to put the best face on <PERSON> Haig </PERSON>'s military background by noting, for example, that no wars were started by presidents who had been generals. But they used ponderous music and ominous images and some gave the impression of `` <PERSON> Julius </PERSON> <PERSON> Caesar </PERSON> returns to the Rubicon,'' said <PERSON> Jamieson </PERSON>. `` It was almost terrifying.''

<HEAD>Dukakis Braces For Bush Attacks On Crime Issues</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER B. DALY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 During last year's legislative session, <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bulger </PERSON> relegated a capital-punishment bill to committee, effectively killing it. <PERSON> Bulger </PERSON> supports the death penalty. But he also supports <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> _ and his move spared the governor from having to veto a death-penalty bill. The incident illustrated how carefully the Democratic presidential front-runner is treading when it comes to crime and punishment. But Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has already attacked <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on some crime issues, and made it clear that there's more criticism to come. At a news conference in <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> last week, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> faulted both <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and Democrat <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> for not supporting the death penalty for `` drug kingpins.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> opposes the death penalty under all circumstances. Another potential point of vulnerability is the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> prison system, one of the most overcrowded in the country. With 6,600 inmates, it is 72 percent over capacity. The legislature, pushed by <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, allocated nearly $ 1 billion to expand capacity, but it will take years to ease the overcrowding. And <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> ran into a storm of protest last year when <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON>, a convicted murderer, walked away from a weekend furlough. He was arrested later in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> and convicted of raping a woman and beating her husband. The <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> case prompted angry calls for elimination of furloughs for first-degree murderers serving life sentences. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> defended the furlough program for months, on grounds that it helped prison administrators by giving lifers an incentive to behave and gave him a record for judging commutation requests. But after key members of the legislature deserted him and opponents gathered enough signatures to place a furlough ban on the fall ballot, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> reversed himself and dropped his opposition to the ban. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> graduate and member of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, is generally considered a liberal on domestic issues, including some criminal matters. In addition to his opposition to the death penalty, he favors controls on handguns. However, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> dismayed some liberals when he instituted a statewide program of police roadblocks to stop motorists to check for drunken drivers. He has also backed a bill that would tighten criminal sentencing and _ for the first time in state history _ allow prosecutors to appeal sentences they consider too low. As governor, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> created a statewide anti-crime council to coordinate the efforts of prosecutors, judges, legislators, police and citizens. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who has never missed one of the council's monthly meetings, says he would create a similar federal program In his campaign literature, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> touts a 14 percent drop in crime in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> since 1983 and the lowest homicide rate of any industrial state. However, most experts attribute the decline to the aging of the state's population, combined with a low unemployment rate. And <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> does n't mention the embarrassing fact that <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> remains the nation's auto theft capital. Overall, state Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Harold </PERSON>, a Democrat who chairs the legislature's <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, gives <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> high marks. `` As an attorney and as someone who's sat in the governor's chair, he has a tremendous overview He's a traditional liberal in his theories, but if something's not working, he wants to change it and get on to the next case,'' <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> said. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>, a professor of criminology at <ORGANIZATION> Northeastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said governors can actually do little about criminal behavior _ and presidents even less. But he said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> should be credited for his attention to criminal issues he can influence. `` When you look at <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, he appears to have liberal leanings, but ones that do indeed seem to be supported by facts,'' he said.

 The <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> woman who gave stargazing advice to first lady <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> says she is `` a serious, scientific astrologer and ... I really do n't like this circus atmosphere.'' <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON> confirmed in a telephone interview from her <LOCATION> Nob </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> home Sunday that Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had consulted her since 1981, as reported by former White House chief of staff <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>, in his book, `` For the Record,'' scheduled to go on sale today, said that `` virtually every major move and decision the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> made ... was cleared in advance with a woman in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> who drew up horoscopes.'' <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> said he did not know her identity. Ms. <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON>, however, said, `` I ca n't deny that she has consulted me. I am very uncomfortable, however, with the situation because normally I never discuss the identity of my clients, and I never discuss their affairs.'' `` I am a serious, scientific astrologer and I am really not one of these clowns, and I really do n't like this circus atmosphere,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON>, who has been practicing astrology since 1960 and has written three books on the subject. <PERSON> Jayj </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>, a member of the board of directors of the Association for Astrological Networking, said Ms. <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON> is `` a specialist in political consulting'' who lectures on `` geopolitical'' astrology. `` She's viewed as a competent professional, and a specialist,'' <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> heiress and Republican political activist, said she did astrological work for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s 1980 presidential campaign. She declined to give the details. `` After the assassination attempt, Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> asked me if she could consult me because she was worried about the president's safety, as well she might be,'' Ms. <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON> said She said Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> telephoned her at `` various times,'' sometimes on Saturday afternoons from Camp David, the presidential retreat in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, as <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> reported. `` I certainly never controlled the president's actions,'' she said. `` Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would want to know if something was a safe time and I certainly advised her on that.'' Ms. <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON> said her advice is based on the exact time and place of a person's birth. In a separate interview with television station <ORGANIZATION> KRON </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, the astrologer said she advised the first lady `` when it was unsafe to fly.'' She added, `` I never had any contact with the president.''

<TEXT>
 From the day that <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> moved from head man at <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> to secretary of the treasury in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> Cabinet, the World War II combat veteran found the White House to be alien territory. <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>'s gruff <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> manner had served him well on Wall Street but failed to help him survive the political battleground of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> or his conflicts with a determined first lady. `` When I was chief executive and I said ` Jump,' people said, ` How high?''' he recalled shortly after coming to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in 1981. When he said the same thing as treasury secretary, he added, people asked, `` Well, do you have an environmental impact statement, what do you mean by high?'' Nevertheless <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> quickly made his mark, winning the president's praise as `` a very fine salesman'' for the tax-cutting policies that were a hallmark of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. In 1985, <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, then the White House chief of staff, got <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s approval to switch jobs. `` As a former <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> colonel and Wall Street star, he fancied the view from the boss's elbow,'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON>, who had been <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s deputy, later wrote. `` Once <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> took over as chief of staff, there was only one man in charge,'' <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON>, then the chief <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, recalls in his recent book. `` The early reports were glowing,'' said <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON>. `` No hint of an accident waiting to happen.'' Troubles soon came, however. When the president underwent cancer surgery in July 1985 <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> aroused First Lady <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s ire by ordering a White House helicopter to fly him to <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. According to <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON>' account, he decided after a telephone call from Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> that he would go by automobile, as she did. After <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s prostate operation the following year, the first lady and the chief of staff again found themselves at odds. She thought he was scheduling her husband for too much activity too early in his recovery. Then came the revelations that the administration had sold arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> while seeking freedom for American hostages and that some of the money had been funneled to help the Contra rebels in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. When the presidential board headed by former Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> made its report on the controversy in February, 1987, it found <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> responsible `` for the chaos that descended upon the White House.'' `` He, as much as anyone, should have insisted that an orderly process be preserved,'' the board said. <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> protested, `` Does a bank president know whether a bank teller is fiddling around with the books? No!'' This, however, was not the world of finance, but the world of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> politics. The capital quickly sensed that <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> was on the way out, and there were widely believed reports that Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was helping him on his way. The end came on Feb. 27, 1987, when <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> chose former <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> as his new chief of staff. <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>, hearing the news from then-national security adviser <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> who had seen it on a Cable News Network broadcast, responded with a one-sentence letter of resignation. Now, 15 months and many sentences later, <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> is giving his side of the story in his book `` For the Record: From Wall Street to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.'' The book, being published Monday, reveals that Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> used astrology to determine the timing of the president's speeches and travel. Once again, judging from the president's reaction, <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> may have chosen the wrong adversary. `` I would have preferred it if he'd decided to attack me,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said Friday, `` and apparently from what we hear he's chosen to attack my wife, and I do n't look kindly upon that at all.''

<TEXT>
 Virtually ever major move and decision the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> made during my time as White House chief of staff was cleared in advance with a woman in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> who drew up horoscopes to make certain that the planets were in a favorable alignment for the enterprise. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> seemed to have absolute faith in the clairvoyant powers of this woman, who had predicted that `` something'' bad was going to happen to the president shortly before he was wounded in an assassination attempt in 1981.
</TEXT>

<TEXT>
 At one point, I kept a color-coded calendar on my desk -LRB- numerals highlighted in green ink for ` good' days, red for ` bad' days, yellow for ` iffy' days -RRB- as an aid to remembering when it was propitious to move the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from one place to another, or schedule him to speak in public, or commence negotiations with a foreign power.

 A full month after the president's release from the hospital, his schedule was still a dead letter because Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s ` Friend' had not provided a list of auspicious days The whole month appeared inauspicious for the president.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>___</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 There was no choice but to humor the first lady in this matter. But the president's schedule is the single most potent tool in the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, because it determines what the most powerful man in the world is going to do and when he is going to do it. But humoring Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> we gave her this tool _ or more accurately, gave it to an unknown woman in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> who believed that the Zodiac controls events and human behavior and that she could read the secrets of the future in the movements of the planets.

 The president was deeply concerned about the hostages, but an inventory of the time he spent on this problem in a given month would undoubtedly show a very low total _ minutes rather than hours. Like that first meeting with -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> Adviser -RRB- <PERSON> Bud </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> at <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION>, the events that snowballed into the catastrophe that came to be known as the Iran-Contra affair made little impression at the time that they happened. Much of what happened was hidden from the president -LRB- and incidentally from me -RRB- by <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> and his successor as national security adviser, Adm. -LRB- <PERSON> John </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> and by the remarkable young Marine who was a virtual stranger to both of us, Lt.

 On Nov. 12, only nine days after the story broke, the pressure from the <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> was so great that the president has no choice but to talk to a congressional delegation. ... The president told them that we had, in fact, supplied arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, but it was only a small amount and we had not swapped arms for hostages. Some of those men were skeptical ... <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> never lied to them; -LRB- or in my experience, to anyone. -RRB- And there is no question in my mind that he believed that he was telling the truth. He knew, of course, that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had shipped anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and that certain Iranians had exerted influence over terrorists in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to facilitate the release of the American hostages.

 `` The parts on abortion have got to come out,'' -LRB- Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> -RRB- said -LRB- about the State of the Union address. -RRB- I pointed out that the president had particularly wanted some language on this subject included in his address. `` I do n't give a damn about the right-to-lifers,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> retorted. `` I'm cutting back on the <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> stuff, too.

 In the four years that I served as secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>, I never saw President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> alone and never discussed economic philosophy alone and never discussed economic philosophy or fiscal and monetary policy with him man to man. From first day to last at <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>, I was flying by the seat of my pants. The president never told me what he believed or what he wanted to accomplish in the field of economics. I had to figure these things out like any other American, by studying his speeches and reading the newspapers.

<TEXT>
 I'm sorry, Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, but I wo n't be in any more. This is my last day. I've been your secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> for four years and your chief of staff for two. You do n't trust me enough even to tell me who my successor is and make a smooth transfer. I deserved better treatment than this. I'm through. I'm very disappointed.

<TEXT>
 I wish to state that my admiration for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as president remains very great. My judgment of him as a man, in light of my final experience as his chief of staff, underwent a certain change, but this is irrelevant. ... any man who had seen as much of the world as I had seen when I came to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> knew better than to put his trust in princes.

 Readers of <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>'s book, `` For the Record,'' might be confused by lack of quotation remarks around most of the quotations from President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. In reporting his conversations with the president, the former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> chief of staff consistently put his own words inside quote marks, but leaves them out in reporting the president's remarks Thus, a typical passage reads: Hi, <PERSON> Don </PERSON>, the President said. Is this a good time to talk? I said, `` Could n't be better, Mr. President.'' <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> explains it this way; `` Out of deference to the office and the man, I have not enclosed language attributed to the president in quotation marks except in cases where his words have already appeared in print elsewhere.''

 The government, mired in a civil war that is sinking the country ever deeper into poverty and famine, is making overtures toward its two main enemies.

Also, <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>'s president, <PERSON> Joachim </PERSON> <PERSON> Chissano </PERSON>, sent Cooperation Minister <PERSON> Jacinto </PERSON> <PERSON> Veloso </PERSON> to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> on April 26 with a conciliatory message for President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>. The possibility of a summit meeting was discussed. A day earlier, <PERSON> Chissano </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Gavin </PERSON> <PERSON> Relly </PERSON>, chairman of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s giant <ORGANIZATION> Anglo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, to discuss possible business ventures. <PERSON> Chissano </PERSON> continues to accuse <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> of supporting the rebels in violation of a 1984 non-aggression pact, a charge <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> denies. However, <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>'s decision to renew high-level contacts with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> suggests it forsees no quick military solutions to the war, which the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says has claimed an estimated 100,000 lives in the past three years. The fighting in northeastern <LOCATION> Nampula </LOCATION> province, visited recently by a group of Western journalists, is representative of the deadlocked war in many parts of <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>. The rebels roam the countryside at will, attacking villages to obtain supplies and often kidnapping residents as forced laborers. Government troops fight an almost entirely defensive war, attempting to protect economic installations and to keep transporation routes open, but seldom seeking out the rebels in the bush. Eighteen of the 21 district capitals in <LOCATION> Nampula </LOCATION> province have been attacked since last October. Refugee camps are swelling and food is in short supply in most areas. Hospitals dispense aspirin and anti-malaria tablets, but not much else. Repeated rebel sabotage on the railway that runs across the province prompted a European consortium to halt repair work until the government can guarantee their security. `` The frequent attacks disrupt the villages and discourage people from staying and planting crops,'' said <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeremiah </PERSON> <PERSON> Nyambir </PERSON>, the provincial governor. `` We are trying to reorganize the military and stabilize the civilian situation.'' Nyambir and other local officials cited several incidents that highlight the military's shortcomings. Nyambir pointed on a map to the three main rebel camps in <LOCATION> Nampula </LOCATION> province, but said the military has never been able to carry out attacks against the locations. When rebels raided the northern coastal city of <LOCATION> Angoche </LOCATION> last year, they they were repelled by the military, local officials said. However, the rebels kidnapped 300 civilians and the army made no attempt to pursue them. Because of poor communications, word of rebel attacks on remote villages can take a week to reach the city of <LOCATION> Nampula </LOCATION>, the provincial capital, <PERSON> Nyambir </PERSON> said. He said the provincial government has been unable to promote the amnesty campaign because <LOCATION> Nampula </LOCATION>'s radio station is n't powerful enough to broadcast much beyond the city limits and leaflets have n't been published because the printing press is broken. Nonetheless, 16 rebels seeking amnesty turned up in the town of <LOCATION> Moma </LOCATION> on April 9, but local authorities had no idea what to do with them, <PERSON> Nyambir </PERSON> said. It took a week before someone could reach <LOCATION> Nampula </LOCATION> and receive instructions on how to handle the surrendered men. The war has made <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> one of the poorest countries in the world and is the primary cause of a famine in which an almost 6 million of the country's 14.5 million people need food assistance. There are more than a million refugees inside the country and 700,000 Mozambicans have fled to neighboring states, including <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The rebel movement, created in 1977 by what was then white-ruled <LOCATION> Rhodesia </LOCATION>, opposes the Marxist policies of the <ORGANIZATION> FRELIMO </ORGANIZATION> party government, but beyond that its aims are vague. No government acknowledges supporting the rebels and they appear to have generated little support among the civilian population with their repeated raids on villages in which they often kidnap residents and force them to carry supplies and grow food at rebel bases. `` Nowhere have I found support -LRB- for the guerrillas -RRB-,'' said <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>. `` I've only found fear and terror.'' Those who have been kidnapped say the guerrillas make little effort to explain their positions. `` They showed me a picture of their leader and told me that when they come to power everyone will have a car,'' said <PERSON> Luciano </PERSON> <PERSON> Alouta </PERSON>, 31, who was kidnapped by the rebels in July and escaped a month later. `` I did not believe what they told me or understand what they were fighting for.'' The rebels threatened to kill anyone who left their camp and made no attempt to become friendly with the captured civilians, <PERSON> Alouta </PERSON> said. Refugees at several different camps in <LOCATION> Nampula </LOCATION> told similar stories. In the town of <LOCATION> Ribaue </LOCATION>, some residents said they sleep in the surrounding woods to avoid being kidnapped in one of the rebels frequent nighttime attacks. The hospital and the local administration building were destroyed, but a cotton gin manages to keep going, despite four guerrilla raids in the past year. The nearby village of <LOCATION> Lalaua </LOCATION> sits empty following a rebel attack in early April in which 50 huts, about a quarter of the village, were burned. The rebels did not occupy the village, but residents are afraid to return, saying they fear a repeat attack.

 A movie called `` Rappin'' is playing on <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Box </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> this month _ five times this month, to be exact _ in which the credits are accompanied by a song whose repetitive refrain is simply, `` Ca n't stop, wo n't stop. Ca n't stop, wo n't stop. It might be the anthem for the current <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign. He ca n't stop, wo n't stop, running against <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>. The vice president is trying to take advantage of the fact that <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the probable Democratic nominee, often comes across as a cool, detached technocratic official in the Carter mold. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s tactic may backfire if voters decide the similarity ends there. `` Malaise'' is n't prominent in the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> dictionary. He likes to talk about hard work and miracles. He says, incessantly, that he wants to be a builder, not a great communicator. He could give lessons in upbeat. Nonetheless, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is hoping that when voters look at <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> they will see <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> interest rates, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> oil prices, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> wringing his hands at Camp David, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> confronting a rabbit with his canoe paddle, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> agonizing while the American flag was being burned and the embassy looted in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. Actually, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is more than hoping that will happen; the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> standard-bearer is trying to make it happen. Reagan-Bush ousted Carter-Mondale in 1980 and crushed Mondale-Ferraro. The temptation to relive these races must be more than <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his staff can bear. Once <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> emerged as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s likely opponent, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign manager quickly labeled the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor a `` Northern-fried Carter'' and the concept became a staple on the campaign trail <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> loves to ridicule `` gloom and doom'' Democrats. In <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, last week he spoke gleefully about `` the gloom and misery'' emanating from the Democrats' camp. On Tuesday, he said, `` Let <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> go around here talking about pink slips, despair, pessimism in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. I'll be the guy out there talking about hope and opportunity.'' Whatever he is, however, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is no gloom and doom Democrat. Speechwriter <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodward </PERSON> recently told <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Broder </PERSON> about the guidance he got when he signed on with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in 1987: `` The first thing he said was: Do n't be negative about the hopes for the country and do n't be overly negative about the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration.'' <PERSON> Woodward </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> writer that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> described `` a problem he saw in the 1980 and 1984 campaigns, the over-preoccupation with what the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> ca n't do at home or in the world He said that was n't his experience in life, or in the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governorship.'' There has been some unmistakable gloom and doom in the Democratic party psyche, but it was the upbeat candidates _ <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> _ who survived the 1988 primaries. And <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is n't likely to make it easy for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to pin the Carter malaise on him. `` The best <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is yet to come,'' he says after running down what he sees as the shortcomings of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> years. `` ... We're going to build a future of hope and pride and opportunity. Still, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wo n't stop. `` It all sounds like <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> reborn again for the third time,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said about the 1988 Democrats. In <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> `` hangs over the Democrats like a shadow, an unwanted reminder of the last time they were in the White House.'' In <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>, he said no matter whether the Democrats nominate <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> or <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, `` It's going to be a very clear choice on the issues ... as clear as 1980, or as clear as 1984. `` I do not want to see this country go back to the failed policies of the past. Here's where things were when we started: `` Interest rates were 21 -LCB- percent. Inflation was double-digit. ... Every family getting wiped out. Employment going the wrong way. This pride in our country down, the military weak. And somebody said to me after I cited those horrible statistics, ` What are you doing? Running against <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>?' `` I said, ` No, I do n't want to run against <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>. But we do n't want to go back to the policies that the liberal Democrats had under <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> that led us to those days of malaise.''' If only <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> were on the ballot.

 Drought has threatened water supplies in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION>, forced some <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> ranchers to sell starving cattle and allowed topsoil and crop seeds to blow away in the northern Plains. In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, residents were ordered to reduce water consumption by 25 percent. <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> residents were asked to cut usage by 10 percent. <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> also has imposed water conservation rules. In northern <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Liberty </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, 70 people attended a 24-hour vigil last week to pray for rain. `` It's almost like you saw in the typical 1930s scenes where clouds of dust are moving across the fields,'' says <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Kollman </PERSON>, district conservationist in <LOCATION> Norman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION> `` You see drifts of dirt almost like snowdrifts in the road ditches. There is lots of dirt in the air and lots of dirt in the houses.'' In the West, two straight winters of poor rainfall and scanty snowfall in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> led to drought. In the Southeast, parts of the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> have been receiving below-normal rain since 1984. In <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, the drought began last fall. Parts of the <LOCATION> northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> enjoyed above-normal rain last summer, but less than expected snow last winter. `` I'm not sure how much longer -LRB- the area -RRB- can take it. It's scary,'' said extension agent <PERSON> Judee </PERSON> <PERSON> Wargo </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Liberty </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, where rainfall since October has measured 0.73 inch, compared with an average 3.17 inches for the period Last week, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clements </PERSON> said <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> and <PERSON> McMullen </PERSON> counties needed federal disaster assistance because of drought. <LOCATION> Starr </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> has had just over 5 inches of rain since Sept. 1, a period in which it normally would receive most of its average annual rainfall of 20 inches. Ranchers have had to sell cattle for lack of hay and forage. In <LOCATION> Jim </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wells </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> west of <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION>, extension agent <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> said ranchers have started burning thorns off prickly pear cactuses so cattle can eat them. But even the cactus is drying up in some areas, said <LOCATION> Starr </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> emergency official <PERSON> Alfonso </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>. Despite above-normal rain in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> in April, `` the drought is still on with a passion,'' said state climatologist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> is having its worst water shortage in 11 years, officials said. Winter precipitation was normal or above normal until the end of January. `` But February and March of this year were dismal, drought-producing months,'' said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbato </PERSON>, a hydrologist with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. Statewide, snow-melt runoff in rivers through mid-summer is expected to be an third of normal, said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Heath </PERSON>, chief of the state's newly activated drought center in <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>. As in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, some ranchers in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s central valley are selling cattle and appealing for federal grain subsidies. Portions of southern <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> have been classified as in a severe drought and sections of eastern <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> are in an extreme drought, said <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>, snow survey superintendent for the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Soil Conservation Service. Rainfall in April was near or above normal for the whole state, but <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> depends on winter precipitation for most of its water. Snowpacks around the state range from 81 percent of normal on <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hood </LOCATION> to 3 percent of normal in <LOCATION> Klamath </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> is at its lowest level since the 1936-1937 dust bowl years. <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>'s mountain snowpack this winter was only 75 percent of normal, meaning less to feed streams during the spring and early summer. Irrigation reservoirs in the state's eastern and central part range from 98 percent full to 10 percent. `` If we get into a normal July and August _ normally very dry months _ we're going to have some real trouble,'' said <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Farnes </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Soil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> snow survey team. The weather service says a mild drought is in effect across northern <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and eastern <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>. Farmers in parts of <LOCATION> northwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> have stopped planting for lack of rain, and sugar beet seeds that were planted are blowing off some fields. Thousands of acres of grass grown for lawn seed have dried up, while high wind last week blew away tons of topsoil. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mickelson </PERSON> on Friday declared 12 counties state disaster areas. In the Southeast, drought has hit the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Authority </LOCATION> especially hard, with the rainfall between June 1984 and April 56 inches. `` That's better than a year's normal rainfall for the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. You're seeing impacts on recreation, hydro generation, water quality,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION>'s chief of reservoir operations.

 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has quietly sent <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> officials a message in an effort to win the release of the remains of 80 American soldiers the <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> government claims to have from the Vietnam War, a congressman disclosed. Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Conn </LOCATION>., said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, in a verbal communique delivered through the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> two weeks ago, offered <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aircraft and military honor guard to pick up the remains <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON>, along with Reps. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON>, D-Ind., has been lobbying <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials to pursue an offer made to the congressmen by a high-ranking <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> diplomat during the lawmakers' visit to <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> in January Cambodian officials said they were willing to release the remains, but have insisted that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials receive them, not an intermediary. <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON> said American diplomats had been reluctant to pursue the remains question with <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> because the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has no formal diplomatic ties with the Communist regime. But the congressman said last week that the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> sent the message offering the honor guard and transportation after two high-ranking members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> _ Reps. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON>, D-Ala., and G.V -LRB- <PERSON> Sonny </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>, D-Miss. _ also applied pressure on the administration. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Lambertson </PERSON>, deputy assistant secretary of state for east <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> affairs who has been handling the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> remains issue for the administration, did not return telephone calls Friday. A <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> has `` succeeded in engaging the <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> regime on this issue -LRB- on behalf of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> -RRB- and we hope its going to work itself out.'' `` We are encouraged,'' said the official, who refused to discuss details of the talks or confirm that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military escorts and aircraft have been offered. <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON>, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> and <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON> in late March sent a telegram to <PERSON> Tep </PERSON> <PERSON> Henn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s ambassador to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, saying they would pick up the remains and personal effects. <PERSON> Tep </PERSON> <PERSON> Henn </PERSON>, in a telegram dated April 21, responded that he found the congressmen's message `` encouraging,'' but set no specifics for turning over the bodies. The congressmen sent another telegram to the ambassador last week confirming the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s offer and suggesting early June as a possible time for a transfer. Some have questioned whether <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> can have 80 soldiers' remains since the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> estimates that only 82 soldiers were lost in <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> terrority during the war No <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> remains have ever been returned by <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. The identified remains of 179 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers have been returned from <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> since 1973 _ 152 from <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, 25 from <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> and two from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, according to Lt.

 Smoggy air in the nation's cities may become significantly cleaner than official projections indicate, new discoveries about auto pollution suggest. Planned new federal regulations to make gasoline less volatile _ harder to vaporize _ may cure a problem only now being recognized, some analysts say. This is the evaporation of gasoline from cars in use, called `` running loss.'' All cars have systems designed to control evaporation while parked. The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> has assumed the system also prevents significant vapors from escaping when the car is driven. On a hot day, it now appears, the system can be overwhelmed and release five to 25 times more unburned gasoline than is permitted in exhaust. The findings are so new that no one has had a chance to calculate their effect. But they suggest that plans for less volatile gasoline may significantly reduce this previously underestimated contributor to smog. `` Official predictions have been under-predicting'' future improvement with the less volatile gasoline in use, said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON>, a partner in <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, air pollution consultants. Gasoline vapor is the major raw material for urban smog. Chemical reactions with other pollutants in sunlight produce ozone, which can make your chest feel tight. In proposing a regulation to cut maximum summer gasoline volatility by 22 percent from the current voluntary standard, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> hinted at the new findings last August. But it said results were too preliminary to use, and did not disclose numbers. However, <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> disclosed numbers at an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> briefing last week. He said <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has results showing that `` running loss'' can reach 10 grams -LRB- about half a liquid ounce -RRB- per mile; his own tests show a maximum of 2 grams per mile. The current limit in exhaust is 0.41 gram per mile. While declining to reveal specific test results, <LOCATION> Tad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wysor </LOCATION>, an engineer in the Emissions Control Technology Division of <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Arbor </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION> lab, said of the 10-gram figure, `` We have n't seen anything that it's wrong but there's not a lot to back it up.'' <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> wants to know whether this has been happening all along, or whether, as <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> believes, only recently because of the rise of fuel-injected engines _ more than 80 percent today compared with practically none in the mid-1970s. Fuel injection systems continuously recycle uninjected fuel back to the tank, carrying heat from the engine compartment and making the fuel hotter. This causes a pressure build-up which, with today's fuel, overwhelms the under-hood charcoal canister that captures and recycles the vapor. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON>, director of automotive emissions control for <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s environmental activities staff, said `` You ca n't put a big enough canister under there'' to capture all running losses, but <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s volatility regulation `` definitely'' will eliminate them. For several reasons, volatility has surged in the 1980s. That causes more evaporations and more ozone. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has known that cars passing its stationary emissions test while using fuel of 9.0 pounds vapor pressure, typical of 1975, flunk badly on today's fuel, which may be 11.5 pounds or higher. <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> says that on one part of the test, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> researchers found 16 times as much emissions using 11.5-pound fuel compared with 9.0-pound fuel. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> last week published the annual list of areas failing to meet national ozone standards. The list rose from 62 to 68 names, and environmental groups said the data showed that smog is getting worse. Most analysts have blamed the failure to reduce ozone levels more quickly on the failure of states and <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> to require stricter controls such as vapor recovery systems on gasoline stations. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Becker </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> and Territorial Air Pollution Program Administrators, said running losses could be a reason some areas violate the standard, but, `` I do n't think this is clearly the major reason.'' Still, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Wysor </PERSON> said, `` If all these things fall into place, it's logical to expect this is a big source and another explanation that could be offered as to why attainment -LRB- of the standards -RRB- has been so hard.'' <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> estimated that volatility controls will reduce emissions of ozone precursors by 8 percent in polluted areas that do not have strict controls of their own, as <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> does. This did not include elimination of running losses. <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> said his impression from conversations at a recent meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automotive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> was `` if we could get -LRB- both running and stationary -RRB- evaporative emissions under control we could reduce emissions by 10 to 15 percent,'' with `` exponential benefits'' to public health.

 A top aide to Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> says a recent congressional report accusing his boss of violating <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics rules should top a `` list of sleaze.'' Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>, who last year was given additional responsibilities as counselor to <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, said the bipartisan <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> report is harmful to ongoing inquiries into the attorney general's actions. `` We've got a process that's in place, people who are investigating and it seems to me that we do not contribute to an integrity of that process when we have that kind of report that comes out that so disserves and so misstates what the facts are,'' <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> CBS-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Face the Nation'' program. `` If that is the best case that one comes up with against this attorney general for ethical conduct, I would have to say that this man is as clean as he can possibly be in every respect.'' Reynolds, the top enforcer of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's civil rights policies, added: `` If I were making a list of sleaze, I'd put that -LRB- the report -RRB- at the top. The report, issued Wednesday by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Governmental Affairs subcommittee on oversight of government management, concluded that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s violation of the rules resulted in `` improper favoritism'' for the scandal-plagued <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The report said <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> sent <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, then counselor to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, 16 memos in 1981 and 1982 detailing <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>'s efforts to get a contract to build small engines for the Army and government officials' opposition to those efforts <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> has acknowledged interceding on behalf of <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>, but says he only wanted to assure that its contract proposal got a fair hearing. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, a longtime friend of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, is now under indictment in the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> scandal. He was paid $ 1.3 million by the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>, N.Y.-company, which subsequently won the no-bid, $ 32 million contract. `` Former Counselor to the President <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and former Deputy Counselor <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> failed to observe the White House policy on contracts with procurement officials, which failure resulted in improper favoritism toward a specific contractor,'' the report said. The White House procurement policy in effect since October 1981 says that `` obviously, no member of the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> staff should contact any procurement officer about a contract in which he has a personal financial interest or in which a relative, friend or business associate has a financial interest.'' <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> said the report `` made reference to a policy or rule in the White House that was n't in existence at the time the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> thing was referred over to the attorney general.'' Independent Counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> has been investigating <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s ties to <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>, a $ 1 billion Iraqi pipeline project promoted by <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, and other matters In addition, the Office of Government Ethics is conducting an inquiry into why <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> solicited 30,000 lawyers and businessman to pay more than $ 3,000 apiece to a profit-making organization to attend a conference. <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> maintained that despite the investigations, morale at the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> remains good. `` Actually, it's very good,'' he said. `` We have a lot of professionals. Everybody in the department is very professional. `` Most of the people in the department take the attitude that is much the same as <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s attitude. These are investigations that are ongoing. They'll play themselves out, the process ought to be allowed to work,'' <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> said. `` So far,'' he added, `` nobody has suggested that the attorney general has done anything that comes close to unlawful activity or activity that is going to result in an indictment of any kind.''

 Voters on Tuesday will shape the future of <LOCATION> Mingo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, a poor backwater once so corrupt a fire chief ran a drug `` carry-out'' and a sheriff allegedly helped protect the business. `` It's up to the people this time,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornsbury </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Williamson </LOCATION> lawyer and first-time candidate who is running for the state <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delegates </ORGANIZATION>. `` They can choose the old way, or they can take the best opportunity they've had to vote good, honest candidates into office.'' Tales of corruption prompted voters to sweep incumbents out of the county courthouse in 1986. This year, most of the old guard _ many under indictment _ did n't bother to run. Even so, voters will have a wide choice. Fifty political novices are among the 69 candidates who filed for 12 offices, which include the legislature, county commission and sheriff. In 1986, voters ousted long-time Democratic party boss <PERSON> Johnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> and his slate of candidates in favor of those backed by <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>' enemy, <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamrick </PERSON>. Then in January 1987, an out-of-county judge and prosecutor specially appointed by the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> launched a grand jury investigation into county politics. Months later, 16 politicians, including <PERSON> Hamrick </PERSON>, were indicted on charges of conspiracy to subvert <PERSON> Mingo </PERSON>'s free elections. `` As ordinary citizens of <LOCATION> Mingo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, we have been repeatedly shocked and dismayed at the manner in which the county government has been organized and run,'' the grand jury said. `` What we have heard individually by way of rumor, hearsay and speculation over the past several years has been verified to us by sworn testimony.'' Taking on the power structure is not easy for some `` ordinary citizens,'' many of whom have long believed their livelihood depended upon remaining in the politicians' good graces. Poverty allowed corruption to flourish, said Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>, who heads a corruption investigation. According to <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>, only 8,700 of the county's 36,000 residents have jobs. More than 2,600 of the jobs are controlled by politicians, such as those who run the school board, the county commission and the anti-poverty agency. As a result, <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> said, many residents believe they must vote the way they're told by the politicians. `` The political bosses had a long-standing habit of threatening people's jobs, their food stamps, their Social Security, and many people just do n't know that they _ the bosses _ ca n't really affect those things,'' he said. This year's deadline for filing for office passed long before the grand jury returned its indictments. But the investigation was no secret, and when the filing period ended, most of the incumbents _ many previously aligned with <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> or <PERSON> Hamrick </PERSON> _ had decided against seeking re-election. `` There are an awful lot of just average good old people running for office this year,'' said <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON>, a high school assistant principal who is one of five candidates vying for the Democratic nomination for a county commission seat. `` People had no idea what was going on with some of our leaders,'' <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> said. `` They knew about who got gravel for their road and who got a job at the courthouse.'' <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON>, a political newcomer, estimates he will spend about $ 2,000 for his campaign. `` In the past, you could n't get elected -LRB- to the commission -RRB- unless you were willing to spend $ 15,000 or $ 20,000,'' he said. According to the indictments, much of that money went to buy votes for politicians who in turn used their positions to protect friends and family engaged in other illegal activities. Former Sheriff <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilbert </PERSON> pleaded guilty to buying his job for $ 100,000 from <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>, his predecessor. <PERSON> Hilbert </PERSON> allegedly used his position to protect <PERSON> Kermit </PERSON> <PERSON> Fire </PERSON> <PERSON> Chief </PERSON> <PERSON> Wig </PERSON> <PERSON> Preece </PERSON>, who was convicted on federal charges of running a `` drug carry-out'' next door to the town police department, headed by his son-in-law, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramey </PERSON>. <PERSON> Preece </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ramey </PERSON>, along with other relatives, were sentenced to lengthy prison terms for their role in <PERSON> Kermit </PERSON>'s drug ring. `` They were doing more business than the K-mart,'' said <PERSON> Tennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON>, a former radio announcer who is a first-time candidate running for sheriff. `` When you can put up a sign on the building that says ` Out Of Drugs, Back In 30 Minutes,' there's something more wrong than usual.''

<TEXT>
 A legislator decided to go against the flow when he noticed how much more time women spent in restrooms than men, so he penned a `` potty parity'' resolution to help relieve the situation. The measure by Delegate <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rollison </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> calls for hearings to determine whether the state plumbing code's 50-50 ratio of space for women's and men's restrooms in public buildings is fair to females who seem to spend a lot of time waiting in line at public facilities. The hearings begin in the fall. `` I've been surprised by the amount of attention this has received,'' <PERSON> Rollison </PERSON> said. `` There should be a lot of people at the hearings.'' He insists he's quite serious about the issue, despite jibes from lawmakers and the press. His resolution was passed by both houses in February amid hoots, chuckles and whispered jokes. But <PERSON> Rollison </PERSON> steadfastly refuses to joke about `` restroom equity'' _ the term he favors over `` potty parity.'' `` I have n't found anyone yet who will tell me this is not a problem,'' <PERSON> Rollison </PERSON> said. He said his legislative aide, <PERSON> Bonnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, and his wife brought the situation to his attention. `` <PERSON> Bonnie </PERSON> did some research and found it was a widespread problem,'' <PERSON> Rollison </PERSON> said. `` Women's restrooms are underdesigned for their flow.'' Ms. <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> said the state's plumbing code calls for equal restroom space for men and women in public buildings. Because urinals occupy less space than toilet stalls, men's restrooms often have more facilities. Ms. <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> cited several other reasons for lines forming in many women's restrooms while men go through without a wait. `` Elderly people take longer,'' she said. `` There are more elderly women than men, and demographically, that's getting worse. Also, there are more handicapped women than men. And younger women often have their children in tow.'' <PERSON> Rollison </PERSON> said the lack of toilets for women affects their enjoyment at public events. `` Some women wo n't even buy a beer at a sporting event,'' he said. Savannah Day, a <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tech </ORGANIZATION> professor of housing who has researched the problem, said she had a friend in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> with a different approach. `` She refused to stand in those long lines at <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> football games,'' Mrs. Day said. `` So she would go to the men's room and her husband would guard the door. The professor said that in addition to the factors cited by Ms. <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, women have more clothing to manipulate and `` do more activities in the restroom'' _ like talk and apply makeup. A <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> undergraduate conducted a similar study for the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state. <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Tran </PERSON>, 20, found that men spend an average of 45 seconds in a restroom stall compared with 79 seconds for women. The sophomore concluded that a 60-40 ratio between women's and men's toilets would be more equitable. <PERSON> Rollison </PERSON>, a Republican, said he expected to take a lot of ribbing over the resolution, but, he added, `` frankly, it did n't bother me. After the resolution was approved, <PERSON> Rollison </PERSON>'s aides decorated his office with toilet paper. Hanging on the door was a toilet lid with the message, `` Congratulations, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON>.'' Newspapers had some fun with <PERSON> Rollison </PERSON>'s resolution. One headline proclaimed: `` Committee lifts lid on ` potty parity.'''

 Rescue workers dug a trench and broke through concrete walls to save a 13-month-old boy who fell down a foot-wide pipe into an unused water storage tank where he was trapped for 2 -LCB- hours. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ulrich </PERSON> on Sunday was taken to <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Luke </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> where he was released with just a couple scrapes, said nursing supervisor <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Sparks </PERSON>. `` I'd say he's a pretty lucky little boy,'' said police Sgt. <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> apparently lifted a loose lid off the cistern when his mother, <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>, went into the house briefly, <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said. When she heard screams, she ran outside and found the boy had fallen 6 feet down the pipe and 4 feet into the storage area, which measured about 6-by-8 feet, he said.

<HEAD>Report Says Estimates of Farm Program Costs Filled With Errors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> knows that <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> estimates of farm program costs `` can not be trusted'' and the record of the past 15 years bears out that assessment, a congressman says. Rep. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> English, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., made the comment Sunday in response to a report he requested from the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, a congressional investigative arm It said farm program costs have exceeded <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> estimates by more than $ 46 billion over a 15-year span. Lawmakers `` know that <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s budget forecasts can not be trusted'' because of the errors, English said. The errors make it difficult to foresee program costs and can have an impact on the amounts that lawmakers authorize, English said in a statement. `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> asks two questions when it considers farm program legislation,'' he said. `` What are the benefits to farmers and the nation and how much will it cost?'' The report found the forecasts by the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> were billions of dollars off target under both <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> and Democratic presidents and more often underestimated how much money would be required than overestimated. The <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> estimates are separate from the figures contained in the president's budget requests. Those requests seek funds to pay off net <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> losses already on the books. <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> estimates are supposed to be a look ahead to conditions in the economy that could put the nation's farm subsidy programs on a roller coaster and place new strains on the budget. Underestimates of the costs of farm programs result in too little money being allocated when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> makes up its spending plan and force <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to come back later in the year to make up shortfalls. The report said <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spending for farm income and price support programs totaled $ 110.7 billion from 1972 through 1986. It said <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> estimates for the period were $ 63.8 billion, or $ 46.9 billion too low. `` <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s budget estimates were substantially incorrect in most years,'' the report said. It put the average at $ 3.1 billion a year beyond the forecasts produced by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The report reviewed estimates for three individual commodities: corn, wheat and dairy. They represented 63 percent of net outlays and 77 percent of the errors of recent years. It said the corn budget estimates contained errors on both the plus and minus sides totaling $ 25.1 billion. On balance, the forecasts were off by a net $ 14.5 billion. That represented the largest amount of error among the three commodities. The report said the errors stemmed from a wide array of difficulties, ranging from mistakes in forecasting supply and demand to problems in managing data and documentation. `` Although <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s forecasting methods have generally been developed by highly skilled staff, little attention has been paid to reviewing and evaluating whether these methods work as intended,'' the report said. It also said that the `` <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> has not had a structured quality control program but has taken some action to correct weaknesses.''

<HEAD>Jackson Challenge Of Delegate Seating Likely, Campaign Chairman
Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> will probably challenge the seating of delegates at the Democratic convention in July because it appears party officials will not act on his objections to the selection process, his campaign chairman says. <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, speaker of the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, said he and other <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> advisers have spoken to <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> and other party leaders about <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s insistence that the delegate totals roughly correspond to the popular vote But those talks, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said, are `` not so far productive,'' and the campaign will likely make challenges to the delegate slates of states where it believes the selection has been unfair. `` I think we are going to end up having to make them because I do n't think it's -LRB- the discussion -RRB- going to be productive,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday. In recent days, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has said he is appealing to party leaders for `` some measure of fairness,'' but he has shied away from any indication that he would make an official challenge or employ the kind of attack he made in disputing party rules in 1984. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> uses <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> as an example _ in that contest, he won the popular vote but the governor awarded all of the island's delegates to <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> Party rules allow for such practices, although in many states the delegate allocation is tied directly to the popular vote. A successful challenge could narrow the gap of roughly 600 delegates between <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and make the delegate tallies more closely reflect the popular vote, which currently stands at some 37 percent for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to 28 percent for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` If we can mount some credential challenge on fairness, this thing does n't have to be over,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said when asked about the conclusion by some observers that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> all but has the nomination locked up. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has said he will talk with `` super delegates'' from congressional districts where he won the popular vote, and appeal for their support even though they are not bound to follow the vote totals. Super delegates attend the convention by virtue of their position as public or party officeholders. On Sunday, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> took that a step further, saying that white Democratic officeholders, especially those in the South who have benefited from the black vote, should be willing to support him on that basis. He singled out <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanford </PERSON> and former <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>, who angered <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> supporters by endorsing <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> Jr.. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> narrowly defeated <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> primary `` It's reasonable to expect that Sen. <PERSON> Sanford </PERSON> will endorse my campaign. That's a reasonable expectation,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Greensboro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, noting that the black vote was crucial to <PERSON> Sanford </PERSON>'s 1986 election. <PERSON> Sanford </PERSON> is a super delegate. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has also hinted that his supporters might stay away from the polls in November if they perceived he was being treated unfairly. He indirectly raised the possibility again on Sunday. `` We define our friends by their willingness to be fair and to be just,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` One thing about politics, it does not go up and down. It goes round and round. Anything that goes around comes around.'' Regardless of the outcome of the race for the nomination, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> officials are confident their delegate strength will ensure their influence on the party platform, and are working on what issues they want to include. `` We wo n't have to worry about getting every plank we want considered,'' said <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. In the meantime, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is unveiling the themes that he hopes will increase that strength in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, the nation's biggest delegate prize. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has an active and broad organization of supporters but he, like <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, must figure out how to appeal to the wider population in this state of 25 million that appears to lack enthusiasm for this year's election. Most Democratic officeholders so far are sitting out the campaign, apparently reluctant to endorse either <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> or <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. Many of them had earlier endorsed one of the five Democrats who have since dropped out of the race. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> characterized his non-endorsing colleagues in the state legislature and other neutral politicians as mostly `` mainstream traditional Democrats'' who would not be expected to endorse the liberal <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and who do n't feel they know enough about <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has been targeting women, environmentalists, Hispanics, gays and peace activists, and continuing to sound his anti-drug and anti-Reaganomics themes. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said campaign strategists are to meet this week to determine what kind of television commercials will be aired in what campaign manager <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> said will be about a $ 2 million ad campaign. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> `` is a hotbed for peace'' and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s positions on peace in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> should sell well, especially on the state's more than 140 college campuses, said <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>.

 When rebels kidnapped peanut farmer <PERSON> Ibraimo </PERSON> <PERSON> Danancha </PERSON> and stole the shirt off his back, he solved his problem in a manner familiar to many clothesless Mozambicans _ he tailored an outfit from tree bark. <PERSON> Danancha </PERSON> had worn the sturdy bark for about a month when he escaped from the guerrillas April 17 and turned up at the refugee camp in the village of <LOCATION> Malema </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> Nampula </LOCATION> province. The bark is rough and grating and none too comfortable, which also describes life in general for most of <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>'s 14.5 million people. <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>'s 11-year-war for independence from <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> -LRB- 1964-75 -RRB-, and the current civil conflict which began in 1977, has left the country one of the poorest in the world despite extensive resources and fertile lands. For many, their lives have been reduced to a daily lesson in survival. `` It is God's business,'' a Mozambican will say stoically when calamity strikes. `` That's life,'' another will add. Almost 6 million hungry people will need more than 900,000 tons of food aid in the next year, the government says. Rural villages throughout the country have been destroyed by guerrillas of the <ORGANIZATION> Mozambique </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION>. Crops have been wiped out by droughts and floods in recent years. In the cities, food is easier to find, but there are other difficulties. <LOCATION> Beira </LOCATION>, the second largest city, is without electricity during the day and the water system works only sporadically. In the capital of <LOCATION> Maputo </LOCATION>, public transportation consists of an occasional standing-room-only bus. While the war has left <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> in shambles, it also has brought forth a certain resiliance and adaptability among its people. In the northeastern city of <LOCATION> Nampula </LOCATION>, residents stage a flea-market every Sunday, displaying their talents for improvising. The tops of discarded beer cans are cut off and turned into cups and flower pots. Used nails are meticulously straightened and resold to people rebuilding homes. Condensed milk tins are used as the base for oil lamps. Small cracker boxes are turned into toy trains with rubber rings used as wheels. Clear plastic in men's wallets is sought for use as protective covering for pictures hung in the home. A stick attached to a can and some strings is transformed into a banjo. Shards of glass are collected and glued to the tops of walls as a security barrier. In recent weeks, waves of grasshoppers have begun to appear in <LOCATION> Nampula </LOCATION>. Every night, residents with glass jars go out under street lights and catch the grasshoppers, which are fried and served as a protein-rich delicacy. Women of limited means have learned to rely on `` capalanas,'' a multi-function wraparound garment. It's used primarily as an everyday dress, which can easily be loosened if the women becomes pregnant. It also can be wrapped and folded in a manner that creates a pouch to carry a child. At night, capalanas are employed as blankets. `` Most Mozambicans have a very slim understanding of what the war is about,'' said <PERSON> Rodney </PERSON> <PERSON> Sidloski </PERSON>, the CARE representative in <LOCATION> Nampula </LOCATION>. `` But they continue to bounce back and adapt no matter what happens.'' Nonetheless, most feel there is no substitute for returning to their village and their land. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Marques </PERSON>, 32, and other members of a refugee camp on <LOCATION> Nampula </LOCATION>'s outskirts walk more than 12 miles every morning to tend their fields. They walk back to the camp in the evenings, because the military ca n't guarantee their security against nighttime guerrilla attacks. `` We ca n't stay on the land until it is safe,'' said <PERSON> Marques </PERSON>. `` But I think we will go back. That day will come.''

<TEXT>
 Although <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has been dramatically successful in the Democratic primaries this year, analysts say he has not repeated a major accomplishment of his 1984 presidential campaign: expanding the black share of the vote. Four years ago, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> drew a vastly higher black turnout in many states. Blacks made up a fifth of the Democratic electorate in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, up from 8 percent in 1980; a sixth in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, also up from 8 percent. But while he has drawn enthusiastic crowds, expanded his support among whites and raised his own share of the black vote this time around, he has not galvanized more blacks to register and vote. `` His first candidacy brought a lot more black voters to the polls. There was a clear pattern of increased black participation,'' said <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> poll analyst <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>. `` That pattern is not repeating itself this year.'' Black voter turnout is crucial for the Democrats because blacks make up one of their core voting blocs. Strategists say <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> could boost the Democrats' chances if he could deliver an expanded black vote in the general election _ and hurt the party's odds if he should discourage black support of the ticket. Viewing the primary results so far, `` The major implication is that you can not expect an unusual black turnout this year,'' said independent pollster <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>. `` If the Democrats are counting on a disproportionate black turnout, it seems to be it's going to be difficult to achieve,'' <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said. `` If <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> ca n't achieve it when there's a direct one-to-one relationship, it's more unlikely to happen when it's not a one-to-one relationship.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> increased black voting in 1984 through massive voter registration drives. He has not conducted such intensive drives this year, and exit polls in many states have found the black vote virtually unchanged from 1984 as a share of the electorate. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> polls said blacks made up 19 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> voters in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> last month, compared to 20 percent in 1984; in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, 16 percent this year, 17 percent in 1984; in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, 24 percent this year, 24 percent in 1984. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> poll results have been similar. `` In <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, despite the publicity about the crowds that greeted <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, black turnout actually was down a bit from 1984,'' said <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>. `` It was steady in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, steady in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, down a bit in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, up a bit in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.'' Polls have shown sizable increases in some states: In <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, blacks made up 35 percent of the turnout in the <ORGANIZATION> CBS-Times </ORGANIZATION> poll, up from 28 percent in 1984. In <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, though, an <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> poll said blacks made up 32 percent in 1988, little changed from 30 percent in 1984. In many cases, more blacks may have voted this year than in 1984, but not in numbers any greater than the increase of other voters, pollsters noted. Another issue for Democrats is whether black turnout may fluctuate in the general election as it has in the primaries, or is more likely to remain stable. In 1984, some analysts expected a greater share of blacks, newly energized by <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, to vote Democratic in November, <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said. But blacks made up 8 percent of the general election vote, down a point from 1980 and three points below their share of the voting age population. The 1984 general election may be a poor example, pollster <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said, `` because that was n't a fight that was turning a lot of people on.'' Still, he said he was surprised that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has not broadly boosted black voters' electoral share this year. `` It just lets you know institutionally how difficult it is,'' <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said. `` Even one man as good as he is is n't able to disproportionately shift the electorate.''

 A former political boss convicted of corruption in a mountain coal mining county charged in a national news broadcast Sunday that he turned down a $ 12,000 payment from Gov. Arch <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>. The NBC News broadcast, two days before an election in which <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> is locked in a tough primary battle with <LOCATION> Morgantown </LOCATION> millionaire <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Raese </PERSON>, brought an angry response from the governor's spokesman. `` As a former journalist, I think it's a piece of garbage,'' said spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON>. `` The governor said that 16 years ago, he had no idea of the existence of <PERSON> Johnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>, the former <LOCATION> Mingo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> political boss, charged that <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> offered him money to buy his organization's backing in 1972. `` Arch <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> laid down in the back seat of a car holding $ 12,000 up in his hand like a common criminal instead of a governor and begged me to take it,'' <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> said on the broadcast. `` The governor said it's strange that 36 hours before West Virginians go to the polls, a supposedly responsible network would air the comments of a convicted felon,'' Price said. A federal court last month sentenced <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> to 14 years in prison on four charges stemming from his role in a 1982 conspiracy to sell the <LOCATION> Mingo </LOCATION> sheriff's job. <PERSON> Raese </PERSON> said he was dismayed by <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s pre-election broadcast of a previously unaired excerpt of a WSAZ-TV interview conducted on April 19 as <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> was about to report to prison. `` I'm very saddened by the whole event,'' <PERSON> Raese </PERSON> said. `` It's a dark moment for Republican politics in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, a Republican, beat Democrat <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockefeller </PERSON> _ then secretary of <ORGANIZATION> state </ORGANIZATION>, now a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senator _ by 600 votes in <LOCATION> Mingo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> in 1972 despite a 7-1 voter advantage for the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>.

 <PERSON> Rodrigo </PERSON> <PERSON> Borja </PERSON>, a center-left lawyer who promised to distance his administration from the current government's pro-U.S. foreign policy, was elected president of <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Borja </PERSON>, 52, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Left </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, defeated populist <PERSON> Abdala </PERSON> <PERSON> Bucaram </PERSON>, 36, in an runoff on Sunday to select a successor to conservative <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Febres </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordero </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s closest ally in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. With the vote count virtually complete, <PERSON> Borja </PERSON> had 1,631,747 votes to <PERSON> Bucaram </PERSON>'s 1,401,153 votes. Nearly 450,000 votes were blank or nullified. More than 4.6 million Ecuadoreans were registered to vote. <PERSON> Bucaram </PERSON>, speaking on national television from his power base in <LOCATION> Guayaquil </LOCATION>, the country's largest city and its major port, conceded defeat Sunday night and congratulated <PERSON> Borja </PERSON>. `` There are no excuses. Dr. <PERSON> Rodrigo </PERSON> <PERSON> Borja </PERSON> is the president of <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Bucaram </PERSON>, a fiery campaigner who had sworn to `` punish the oligarchy'' if elected. Speaking over television in <LOCATION> Quito </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Borja </PERSON> said, `` Thank you, <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>, thank you.'' It was <PERSON> Borja </PERSON>'s third bid for the presidency. He was narrowly defeated by <PERSON> Febres </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordero </PERSON> in a bitterly fought runoff in 1984 and has pledged to reverse his foe's free-market economic policies. But he also told <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>'s business community not to be frightened by his election. `` Our victory should not make anyone nervous. No one should set off a financial panic,'' <PERSON> Borja </PERSON> said Sunday night. `` We intend to respect private enterprise.'' <PERSON> Borja </PERSON> has promised to back a moratorium on payment of <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>'s $ 9.2 billion dollar foreign debt if creditors do n't agree to negotiate easier terms `` I do not believe it is possible to pay the foreign debt under the conditions they want to collect,'' he said in a recent meeting with foreign correspondents. `` Either we pay the debt or we develop the country. We ca n't do both things at the same time.'' The <PERSON> Febres </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordero </PERSON> government suspended payment on the debt last year after severe economic damage from devastating earthquakes. <PERSON> Borja </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bucaram </PERSON> defeated eight other candidates in the first round of elections Jan. 31 to qualify for the runoff. <PERSON> Febres </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordero </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, came in third, a sign of his government's low popularity. The victory by the left-leaning <PERSON> Borja </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bucaram </PERSON> sent tremors through <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>'s financial circles. The Ecuadorean currency plunged in value from 275 sucres to the dollar to nearly 500 sucres since the first round of voting. <PERSON> Borja </PERSON> has said he plans to establish exchange controls and restrict imports to protect <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>'s dangerously low dollar reserves. He also plans price controls on basic consumer goods. He says he will seek close ties to the non-aligned movement and re-establish diplomatic relations with leftist-led <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Febres </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordero </PERSON> severed relations in 1985 after an argument with Nicaraguan President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>. <PERSON> Borja </PERSON> will be sworn in Aug. 10 for a four-year term. He will be the third elected president since democracy was restored in 1979 after nine years of civilian and military dictatorships. <PERSON> Borja </PERSON> will confront the challenge of a governing a nation that is in its deepest recession since it began exporting oil in the early 1970s. The economy shrank 3.5 percent last year, thanks in great measure to the sharp drop in the price of oil, <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>'s major source of income. Inflation is running at an annual rate of 70 percent, the highest level since 1983, and less than half the work force has full-time employment.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet artists are trying to draw the cultural gap between the two countries to a close, and the idea has people laughing. The traveling `` USSR-USA Cartoon Exchange'' features cartoons from both countries that sponsors hope will erase walls of misunderstanding. Is it working? `` Da!'' exclaimed the show's curator, <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Swenson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. `` Big yes! `` Cartoons communicate the universal, wordless art that can make people laugh,'' he said during the show's debut here this weekend. `` I'm overwhelmed by the instant rapport the artists from the two countries develop. Listen to the sound in this building.'' The sound Saturday in the gallery was laughter. Through a live `` videophone'' hook-up, about 10 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> artists serenaded a group of Soviet artists in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. They requested `` a typical American song'' and got `` Take Me Out to the <LOCATION> Ball </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>.'' The Americans got a long-distance ovation. `` I'm literally blown away by the quality and the humor,'' said <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Bassett </PERSON>, editorial cartoonist for the <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> who draws the syndicated comic strip `` Adam.'' `` I guess that's an indication of how little our two cultures have touched,'' he said. <PERSON> Iuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Ivanov </PERSON>, a 41-year-old cartoonist from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on hand for the opening, picked his favorite American exhibit of the 40 being shown and sent it electronically to his colleagues in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. `` I like it because it's stupid,'' <PERSON> Ivanov </PERSON> said, not being critical. `` It describes the stupidity of the situation perfectly.'' The cartoon by <PERSON> Wiley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> showed a complacent Soviet Bear and casual Uncle <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> standing in front of two television cameras, one camera Soviet, the other Amercian. The lens in the American camera shows the bear trying to devour Uncle <PERSON> Sam </PERSON>. Conversely, the lens in the Soviet camera shows Uncle <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> with a gun to the bear's head. `` Very definately the perceptions are changing,'' <PERSON> Ivanov </PERSON> said. `` The more of these type of exchanges, the more this picture wo n't be true. Not even the most optimistic of the 50 or so people at the opening saw rosy Soviet-U.S. relations being painted with one stroke of the brush. <PERSON> Ivanov </PERSON>, however, hailed increased cultural exchanges made possible by Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of glasnost, which has opened doors for Soviet artists. The few political jabs in the cartoons shown by the Soviet artists were light, and any political satire tended to generalize. Bureaucracy was lampooned, not the bureaucrats. In one of <PERSON> Ivanov </PERSON>'s watercolors, a man tied to a noose serves as the clapper in a bell. A smiling man in a uniform swings from the hapless clapper's feet. `` The common man suffers so others can enjoy,'' <PERSON> Ivanov </PERSON> explained. But he quickly pointed out the picture is n't representative of capitalism or communism `` It's like that everywhere,'' he said. Some Americans are slow to accept glasnost as anything more than a concept, he said. For instance, he pointed to a picture by <PERSON> Milt </PERSON> <PERSON> Prigee </PERSON>, editorial cartoonist for the <ORGANIZATION> Spokane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Spokesman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION>. The cartoon shows a man behind bars, with the familiar smiley faces drawn around it along with the Soviet sickle and the word `` glasnost.'' `` The artist does n't understand the situation of glasnost,'' <PERSON> Ivanov </PERSON> said. `` The bars are cut. That was a problem before, but not anymore. Things are immensely better under <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>.'' Asked for an example, <PERSON> Ivanov </PERSON> replied, `` For example, I am here.'' The show continues here through June 7 before heading to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>. After that it moves to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>

 What makes a good sentence go bad? `` Like an expensive sports car, fine-tuned and well-built, <PERSON> Portia </PERSON> was sleek, shapely and gorgeous, her red jumpsuit moulding her body, which was as warm as the seatcovers in July, her hair as dark as new tires, her eyes flashing like bright hubcaps, and her lips dewy as the beads of fresh rain on the hood; she was a woman driven _ fueled by a single accelerant _ and she needed a man, a man who would n't shift from his views, a man to steer her along the right road: a man like <PERSON> Alf </PERSON> <PERSON> Romeo </PERSON>.'' That awful thing was submitted to the annual Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest by 20-year-old journalism student <PERSON> Rachel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheeley </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Franklin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>.

The contest also is a gentle reminder to the world of letters that it is OK to lighten up, forget the grammar books for a minute and have some fun, to `` approach the language recreationally as well as practically,'' <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> said. For her effort, <ORGANIZATION> Sheeley </ORGANIZATION> wins a word processor. This, <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> noted, illustrates the computer-terminology adage, `` Garbage in, garbage out.''

 The dollar steadied against the Japanese yen Monday after opening lower in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, while stock prices dropped in a market traders described as lusterless. The dollar opened at 124.73 yen and then edged up to close the day's session at 124.87 yen, down 0.01 yen from Friday's close. On the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the 225-issue <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION>, which shed 46.62 points during last Saturday's half-day session, continued to slide downward, losing 223.47 points or 0.81 percent to end the day at 27,264.30. Dealers said the lack of major market-affecting news is contributing to a sluggish <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency, and market participants are watching the dollar's weak showing after the release Friday of favorable <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> unemployment figures.

<HEAD>Malnutrition Still Serious Problem Among Chinese Youth</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 About one-third of Chinese youth suffer from malnutrition despite overall gains made in height and weight in the past decade, the official <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> reported today. The report quoted <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> Deputy Minister <PERSON> Zuo </PERSON> <PERSON> Shiyin </PERSON> as saying that under standards of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> based on height-weight ratio, 28.98 percent of male students and 36.16 percent of female students are undernourished. The findings came from a two-year study of nearly 1 million Chinese aged 7 to 22. The survey found that urban schoolboys have grown an average 1.2 inches and are 4.8 pounds heavier than they were 10 years ago. City girls are one inch taller and 3.1 pounds heavier. Young people in rural areas showed somewhat larger increases in both height and weight. But the daily said the growth rates are still far below those of Japanese students owing mainly to the gap in nutritional levels.

<HEAD>Strong Earthquakes Rock Japan and Philippines</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Separate strong earthquakes rocked northern <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the main Philippine island of <LOCATION> Luzon </LOCATION> today, swaying buildings and trees but apparently not causing any serious injuries or damage, officials said. The Japanese quake registered a preliminary 5.2 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale and was the second strong temblor to hit the northern island of Hokkaido in less than three days, <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Meteorological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> officials said. They said it struck at 7:44 a.m. -LRB- 6:44 p.m. Sunday -RRB- and was centered in the <LOCATION> Hidaka </LOCATION> mountain range, 45 miles away from Saturday's earthquake, which measured a preliminary 6.4 on the scale. Local police said there were no immediate reports of damage or casualties. The pre-dawn <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> earthquake struck at 3:45 a.m. -LRB- 3:55 p.m. Sunday -RRB- and registered a preliminary 5.4 <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> reading, the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observatory </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Volcanology </ORGANIZATION> and Seismology said it was centered 110 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> under the <LOCATION> Luzon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. Earthquakes measuring 5 on the open-ended <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale are classified as strong and capable of causing considerable damage in populated areas. However, both quakes were located deep below the earth's surface and therefore caused little damage, officials said. Both earthquakes also occurred in quake-prone areas where edges of the earth's crustal plates are thought to rub together, a <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Meteorological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> official said. `` It's been some time since we had earthquake activity in that area of Hokkaido, so it's not surprising to have some now caused by a build-up of pressure between the plates,'' he said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The official said there was no way of knowing whether the Japanese quake was related to the one in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, 2,250 miles away. The Philippine islands are thought to be located on the edge of a separate, smaller crustal plate which extends up to southern <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Institute spokesman <PERSON> Ulpiano </PERSON> <PERSON> Trillanes </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> earthquake affected a wide area of <LOCATION> Luzon </LOCATION> island, including <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, but apparently caused no serious damage or injuries. In the past 35 years there have been two major earthquakes in Hokkaido. In 1968, the <LOCATION> Tokachi-Oki </LOCATION> earthquake measuring a 7.9 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale killed 52 people. The Richter scale measures the total magnitude of an earthquake. Every increase of one digit in the scale represents a tenfold increase in magnitude, thus a reading of 4.5 would be 10 times stronger than one of 5.5.

<HEAD>Crew: $2.5 Million Yacht Singled Out For Seizure Under Drug Policy</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Crew members on a $ 2.5 million yacht seized under a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug policy called `` Zero Tolerance'' say the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> unfairly targeted the craft and was thrilled to find some marijuana seeds and stems. The 133-foot Ark Royal, a white fiberglass floating villa trimmed with teakwood and polished brass, was escorted into port Sunday night to be turned over to the government under the month-old order to seize any vessel carrying even a tiny amount of drugs. `` It's punishment for no just cause,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, one of the six crew members, which included one woman. `` It's just a lot of malarkey.'' The Coast Guard cutter <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> stopped the yacht Saturday in the Yucatan Channel between <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, and a search turned up less than one-tenth of an ounce of marijuana, authorities said. `` They followed us for maybe one or two hours,'' <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said. `` They did n't respond to any of our radio calls ... they did n't let us out of their sight.'' But Capt. <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON>, commander of the Coast Guard Key West station, said such searches are random, and the yacht was not singled out as an example. `` We generally look at any northbound vessel going through that area,'' <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON> said. `` The Yucatan Channel is a natural bottleneck from the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> to the Gulf of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>.'' <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> officials say the vessel initially was stopped for a courtesy boarding to check paperwork and safety equipment, but a full search was ordered after marijuana residue was found in a trash can. `` They found five seeds in a trash can and they rooted through the whole place,'' said a crew member, who gave his name only as <PERSON> Roy </PERSON>. `` Ten seeds and a couple of stems are all they found.'' Crew members say the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> party then came aboard with saws and drills hoping to find more illegal drugs, but the yacht's captain refused to allow any more searching until the ship reached port <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said the yacht departed from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> more than a month ago and was headed to <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> and then to the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> for charters. `` It's the most beautiful boat I've ever seen,'' said Coast Guard <PERSON> Ensign </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Brewer </PERSON>, part of the search party. `` The inside of it looks like something out of ` The Great Gatsby.''' The yacht is decorated in art-deco style, and contains works of art, a grand piano and two Jacuzzis, <PERSON> Brewer </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Ark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION>'s registered owner is <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogerson </PERSON>, president and chief shareholder of <ORGANIZATION> Tomima </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Lt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Felker </PERSON>. Neither <PERSON> Rogerson </PERSON> nor any passengers were on board, said <PERSON> Felker </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> said the seizure was excessive. It violates a sense of proportionality, said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Coombs </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> Miami chapter. `` It's putting people at enormous risk with no effective way of protecting themselves,'' she said. Boater <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Seger </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> is trying to seize private vessels and sell them as a way of making up money it lost from its recent $ 100 million budget cuts. But Key West charter boat captain <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Knowles </PERSON> said he is refusing anyone on his boat who intends to use drugs. `` It's fine if you want to do it, but not on my boat,'' he said. `` I do n't want to lose my boat and lose my whole livelihood.''

<HEAD>U.S. Navy Explodes Mine In Persian Gulf</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE>
<TEXT>
 The following dispatch is from <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kearns </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Reuters </ORGANIZATION>, the press representative in the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> news pool in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. ABOARD THE USS COPELAND -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> divers have exploded a mine found drifting in the northern <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> by the missile frigate <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>. The mine found Sunday was the first discovered in the area since the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> missile frigate <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> was nearly sunk by a mine last month. Also Sunday, three motor boats raced toward a convoy of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ships, but veered off. A <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> official said they were probably operated by smugglers. Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyke </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, told a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> media pool the <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> reported the mine was 85 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Farsi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, where the <LOCATION> Iranians </LOCATION> have a military base. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> divers detonated it an hour later. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyke </PERSON> said the mine was an encrusted Myam-type mine that apparently had broken loose from its mooring. The Myam is smaller than the type of mine containing 250 pounds of explosives that holed the <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> on April 14 off <LOCATION> Qatar </LOCATION>, 140 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Farsi </LOCATION>, wounding 10 crewmen. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has accused <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> of laying the mines to disrupt gulf shipping. In retaliation for the <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> mining, he ordered attacks on Iranian oil platforms April 18. That led to a string of clashes between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Iranian ships. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> claimed it sunk three Iranian warships and damaged three others. A multi-national mine sweeping force has detonated at least six mines since the <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> was hit. French warships have reported finding other mines further south in that period. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, backed by the British, French, Belgians and Italians, has dealt with scores of mines in or near the gulf since last summer. Sunday's mine discovery came as shipping traffic picked up in the waterway after a lull caused by last month's clashes. But the shipping community remains edgy. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> has sworn revenge for its losses last month. Earlier Sunday, three fast-moving motor boats raced across the <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION>, gateway to the gulf, toward a U.S.-escorted convoy. One darted under the Copeland's guns across the warship's bow. That jarred already jittery nerves aboard the convoy ships as the whaler-type boat sped past into the wake of the supply ship USS San Jose and the oil tanker Ranger. All three unidentified boats then disappeared into the sweltering haze, heading toward the <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION> coast. The <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON>'s captain, Cmdr. G.M. <PERSON> Ziller </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, radioed a warning to the apparently unarmed boats, but raised no response. <PERSON> Ziller </PERSON> said they may have been smugglers who decided to ignore what he joked was the `` law of gross tonnage'' by zipping in front of the heavily armed 3,600-ton frigate. `` I do n't think there was any hostile intent,'' he said. The convoy passed within range of Chinese-made Silkworm missiles on the nearby Iranian coast. The pace of U.S.-escorted convoys has returned to what it was before the April 18 fighting and <LOCATION> Iranian </LOCATION> navy ships have all but disappeared. Four convoys have moved through the strait in the past week and <ORGANIZATION> navy </ORGANIZATION> officials say the escort operations will continue as needed. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s 354-foot supply ship, <PERSON> Booshehr </PERSON>, glided within 2,500 yards of the 3,700-ton missile frigate USS Jack Williams early Saturday. The two ships sailed past each other without incident in the the closest encounter between the two navies since last month's battles. Some <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officers believe the Iranians are licking their wounds and deciding what went wrong before making the next move. `` I think they're doing what we would be doing in the same situation,'' the skipper of the 24,000-ton <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, Capt. <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Halley </PERSON>, told the media pool Saturday. `` They're figuring out what happened to the chain of command and who's responsible and what should be done about it. `` This could be a lull while they work on the next step,'' he said, noting a long-standing split between the regular Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and the Revolutionary Guards who have attacked neutral shipping with armed speedboats. Since the April 18 fighting, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has laid down new rules for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships patrolling the gulf, allowing them to help non-American ships under attack if <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intervention is requested. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has 28 warships in the region, including an aircraft carrier-led task force stationed in the north <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Latest In Funeral Coaches: Velvet Seats, Microwave Oven</HEAD>
<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Mourners wanting to getting their loved ones to the cemetery in comfort may want to consider the latest in funeral coaches: one with velvet seats and options like a stereo, refrigerator and microwave oven. The Airstream Family Funeral Coach gets 9 to 12 miles per gallon and eliminates traffic snarls resulting from caravans of mourners traveling to the cemetery, according to its manufacturer. All this comfort and practicality does n't come cheap, however. Funeral home directors can expect to pay $ 52,000 to $ 73,000 for the aluminum coaches. The 28-foot vehicle constructed from a motor home chassis can carry 16 people up front and the dear departed in a separate compartment toward the rear. The casket can be surrounded by shelves of flowers and be bathed in spotlight. `` Some of the relatives may not have seen each other for 20 years,'' said <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Croel </PERSON>, salesman for the Ohio-based Airstream. `` The time that they get a chance to talk together is when they're together in the privacy of this coach. Airstream displayed one of its coaches at a recent funeral directors' meeting in <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Needham-Storey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Funeral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, which has funeral homes in <LOCATION> Marion </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, owns one: a strictly no-frills model lacking many of Airstream's available amenities, such as lavatory. `` We were somewhat skeptical, but we still voted to go ahead and buy it,'' said <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Wampner </PERSON>, co-owner of <LOCATION> Needham-Storey </LOCATION>. `` We knew, without a doubt, that it is the -LRB- funeral -RRB- vehicle of the future.'' Not every funeral director liked the silver-and-black vehicle. `` I think it's a little much,'' said <PERSON> Christina </PERSON> <PERSON> Burkholder </PERSON>, who works at her family's funeral home in <LOCATION> Seymour </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The World Wildlife Fund, arguing that endangered animals should not be used to boost zoo profits, plans to oppose a scheduled visit by a touring pair of Chinese giant pandas to <LOCATION> Zoo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. The fund already has filed objections to panda visits at the <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, zoo and the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> State Fair in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>; however, the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, which must approve the visits, has approved the <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION> visit. The agency will not rule on <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s panda request until at least June 6, said spokesman <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Klinger </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The fund contends that the exhibits would serve no scientific purpose and that short-term loans inhibit panda breeding. A delegation from <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION> is in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to pick up the pandas and is expected to return with the animals Friday, <ORGANIZATION> Toledo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zoo </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> visit scheduled for September was arranged by former President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> during a trip to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> last year. <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Block </PERSON>, the fund's director of public programs, said an American law and an international agreement prohibit commercial exploitation of endangered animals. Block, a former curator of education at <LOCATION> Zoo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, said it was painful for him to oppose the exhibit because he considers zoo director <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Maple </PERSON> `` a great proponent of conservation.'' Zoo <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> officials said they are still preparing their application. <PERSON> Klinger </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION> permit requires that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> use loan profits for panda conservation projects; Toledo Zoo officials ensure the money is used for conservation; and the zoo reports annually on how <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> used the money for conservation. Block said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> typically gets $ 300,000 to $ 500,000 for a three-month panda exhibit. None of the applications submitted thus far contains a provision to use profits to help pandas, he said. `` I can see where panda exhibits could be a great boon to panda conservation,'' <PERSON> Block </PERSON> said. `` If all the extra money realized from a panda exhibit was returned to conservation, then that would mean using that creature for its own protection and that would be fine.''

<DATELINE>EASTON, PA. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A small school district plans to embark on an experiment that will give teachers greater authority but also greater accountability for producing well-educated children. If approved tonight by the school board and the eastern <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> district's 400 teachers, the three-year contract extension will give teachers a greater voice in student discipline and promotion, budgets and school board meetings. If the teachers' new roles do not improve student performance, the plan and most of the gains teachers stand to make will end with the contract extension, said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Moloney </PERSON>, superintendent of the <ORGANIZATION> Easton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION>. `` If we find out that dictatorial governance works better, then by <PERSON> God </PERSON>, we'll do it,'' <PERSON> Moloney </PERSON> said. `` But we believe that's not true.'' The idea, called `` shared governance,'' also calls for creation of a labor-management panel to hear concerns about teacher transfers, assignments or schedule changes, and a master teacher panel to recognize superior teachers and to encourage them to assist colleagues falling short of expectations. `` Shared governance says, ` You are a professional and we're now going to give you control over what you are entrusted to do,'' said <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>, a fifth-grade teacher and president-elect of the teachers' union. The plan was proposed by <PERSON> Moloney </PERSON> and revised during eight months of discussion with principals, teachers, union representatives and school board members. The contract extension includes significant increases in teachers' and principals' salaries beginning in 1990, <PERSON> Moloney </PERSON> said. The average teacher salary in the district is about $ 28,400, but the parties refused to provide specific figures on increases before the vote. Known as an advocate for teachers, <PERSON> Moloney </PERSON> gained their trust soon after arriving here in late 1984. In 1985, he won approval of a five-year contract in a district where bitterness led to strikes in 1976 and 1980. <PERSON> Moloney </PERSON> said much of the proposal was based on his interpretations of recommendations made in the May 1986 <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> task force report called ` A Nation Prepared: Teachers for the 21st Century.'' Some of its recommendations have been tried in <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Moloney </PERSON> was assistant superintendent before coming to <LOCATION> Easton </LOCATION>. Large salaries for teachers and limited shared governance have made <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION> a much-scrutinized laboratory for school reform, but <PERSON> Moloney </PERSON> wanted to go further. The <PERSON> Easton </PERSON> proposal differs by forcing teachers and principals to bet major contract provisions on plans scheduled to take effect two years later. All participants _ the school board, teachers and principals _ can veto the plans, which include a new evaluation system for teachers and administrators and a new program to recognize outstanding teachers. If any provision fails to take effect as scheduled, the principals forfeit their hefty salary increases and the teachers lose their personnel committee for reviewing teacher transfers. `` This is serious carrot and stick stuff,'' <PERSON> Moloney </PERSON> said. The pact is part of <PERSON> Moloney </PERSON>'s larger goal _ teaching the district's 7,600 students to read and write, add and subtract. <PERSON> Moloney </PERSON> said his plan will mean nothing if it does not produce better-educated children. `` The bottom line is demonstrably improved outcome,'' <PERSON> Moloney </PERSON> said. `` The name of the game in education reform is better outcomes.''

 The dollar firmed in dealings against the Japanese yen today after opening lower in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, and stock prices continued to slide due to a lack of market incentives, traders said. After opening at 124.73 yen, the dollar firmed in afternoon trading to close the day at 124.87, down 0.01 yen from Friday's close `` The dollar is continuing to hover around the 124-125 yen range of the past two weeks because of the absence of market-influencing news,'' said a <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> exchange dealer, who requested anonymity. On the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the 225-issue <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION> fell 223.47 points, or 0.81 percent, closing the day's session at 27,264.30. The index declined 46.62 points during last Saturday's half-day session Volume on the first section was estimated at a thin 600 million shares. Traders said investors were apparently reluctant to buy shares due to the approach of a flurry of earnings reports by Japanese companies in upcoming weeks, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s mid-quarterly refunding due to start Tuesday, and next week's American trade figures. <PERSON> Yoshio </PERSON> <PERSON> Shimoyama </PERSON>, a trader with <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, said trading picked up at the start of the week's dealings Monday morning but fizzled out by midmorning as market investors sat back to await fresh incentives. In thin afternoon dealings, steelmakers, shipbuilders and automakers, such as <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION>, fell in price. Heavy and light electricals, including <PERSON> Matsushita </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION>, also came under selling pressure.

<HEAD>Kohl's Party Discusses Damage After Big Loss in State Vote</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KENNETH JAUTZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Stunned leaders of Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s governing <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> gathered today after their party was ousted from power in state elections in <LOCATION> Schleswig-Holstein </LOCATION> for the first time in 38 years. The party's top officials, led by <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, met in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> to assess the damage done to the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> in the Sunday elections in the northern West German state. The results marked one of the worst defeats for the governing party since <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> took office five years ago. The <LOCATION> Schleswig-Holstein </LOCATION> poll also was a decisive victory for the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, who had lost ground in a string of state elections over the past 18 months. While the <LOCATION> Schleswig-Holstein </LOCATION> election will have little immediate effect on <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s coalition government in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, it will boost the Social Democrats' flagging morale nationwide. The results may also increase bickering with <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s often fractious three-party federal coalition. The election will also narrow, but leave intact, the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> majority in the Bundesrat, or upper house of the West German parliament. Unofficial results showed the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> polled 33.3 percent of the vote, which was called to break the stalemate in the state's government that followed an inconclusive election in September 1987. In the September vote, the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> had polled 42.6 percent of the vote. The Social Democrats posted a surprising 54.8 percent of the vote, well above the 45.2 percent it polled in September, according to the unofficial figures. The results were the best-ever posted by the Social Democrats in <LOCATION> Schleswig-Holstein </LOCATION>, and gave the party 46 of the 74 seats in the state's parliament. The liberal Free Democratic party _ the junior party in <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s governing coalition _ also posted decisive losses, falling from 5.2 percent of the vote in September to 4.4 percent Sunday The loss was key because it means the <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> failed to win 5 percent of the vote, and are thus barred from taking any parliamentary seats under West German law. The environmental <ORGANIZATION> Greens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION> also failed to win parliamentary seats, posting just 2.9 percent of the vote, well below the 3.9 percent it won in September. Under West German voting procedures, it will be several days before the results, based on reported returns from polling stations, are verified and declared final. Political analysts say the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> majority assures that the state governor's post will go to <PERSON> Bjoern </PERSON> <PERSON> Engholm </PERSON>, who led the opposition party through what was a largely lackluster campaign. <PERSON> Engholm </PERSON> was the target of a political dirty tricks campaign last year by former <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> governor <PERSON> Uwe </PERSON> <PERSON> Barschel </PERSON>. After the campaign came to light, <PERSON> Barschel </PERSON> was found dead in a <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> hotel in October, and authorities ruled the death an apparent suicide.

<HEAD>Gdansk Shipyard Workers Reject Compromise Offer To End Strike</HEAD>

 Striking shipyard workers today rejected a compromise that would have forced them to end their weeklong strike and drop their demand for legalization of Solidarity in exchange for a pay raise. `` There is no freedom without Solidarity,'' the workers chanted at a rally this morning as they rejected the compromise offered by management following a four-hour negotiating session with the strike committee, union sources said. <PERSON> Piotr </PERSON> <PERSON> Konopka </PERSON>, an aide to Solidarity founder <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, said the 400 to 500 workers at the shipyard repeatedly screamed `` no'' when told of the offer. The tentative deal had taken shape in talks revived at the initiative of a Politburo member on Sunday, strike leaders said. Interior Minister <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON>, a ranking communist party Politburo member, twice telephoned a lawyer acting as a mediator to revive the talks after they broke down late Sunday afternoon, according to accounts given by strike committee members. The conversations between <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> and lawyer <PERSON> Wladyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Sila-Nowicki </PERSON>, a former Solidarity member who has since agreed to serve on Polish leader Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>'s consultative citizens' council, led to new talks. As a result, the strike committee wrote a letter to management on Sunday in which it agreed to end the strike and postpone its long-term goal of reinstating Solidarity under the following conditions: _ Guarantee of safe passage from the shipyard for strikers and the people who have assisted them _ Promises of no discipliantry action against strikers, including fines, dismissals or prosecutions _ A wage increase of $ 38 dollars on the average monthly wage of the last three months, or about $ 105 _ Formation of a joint committee from members of the strike committee and the shipyard workers' council to oversee implementation of the agreement Management ultimately agreed to a raise of $ 39 monthly based on the average wage in the third quarter of 1987, when wages were somewhat lower, strike sources said. The average pay for that quarter was not immediately available. In addition, strike sources said, there was a promise that fired Solidarity activists would be rehired, but only if the shipyard was short of manpower, and an oral promise that some unspecified political prisoners would be freed. The number of strikers was only about half the 800-1 ,000 reported inside the yard Friday, according to Western reporters there Sunday <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> has remained among the workers at the plant. The strike began May 2. A settlement would have ended a two-week wave of labor unrest which the government has said is threatening <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s reputation abroad and its economic reform plans at home. It has been <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s worst labor upheaval since the 1981 military crackdown the preceded the outlawing of Solidarity The union, born in the <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> shipyard in August 1980, was the first independent trade union in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc. Meanwhile, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> primate, Cardinal <PERSON> Jozef </PERSON> <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON>, spoke out Sunday for the right of all people to participate in society's decisions. His sermon followed a statement Saturday by Polish-born Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> that strikes can be justified and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> lacked `` true democracy.'' And 55 intellectuals and oppositionists charged in an open letter that the government's policy of national reconciliation is a `` game of appearances.'' On Sunday, management told workers inside the shipyard they could face discipline or arrest if they did not leave by 6 p.m., said <PERSON> Konopka </PERSON>. The workers ignored the ultimatum. The government has never ruled out the use of force to end the strike. A predawn raid by a police anti-terrorist unit and riot police crushed a 10-day strike by steelworkers in <LOCATION> Nowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huta </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> on Thursday. On Sunday morning, at least 7,000 slogan-chanting people attended a church service to support the workers on strike for a seventh day. Thousands of police reappeared on the streets of this <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> port city to maintain order around <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brygida </LOCATION>'s Church, where worshippers rallied and heard a rousing speech by the Rev. <PERSON> Henryk </PERSON> <PERSON> Jankowski </PERSON>, a friend and adviser of <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>. Food supplies were choked off in a police blockade in place since Thursday. Children as young as 8 and 10 have been sneaking into the shipyard with a little food, notes and cigarettes, he said. In the wave of strikes that began April 25, workers have pressed for higher wages to counteract inflation hitting 42 percent in the first three months of 1988. Authorities have argued that some of the strikes were instigated by `` professional politicians,'' especially leaders of Solidarity, who want to exploit <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s economic troubles for political ends

<TEXT>
 The former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> denied telling Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as early as 1985 that Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> may have been involved in drug trafficking. The ambassador, <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> <PERSON> Briggs </PERSON>, said on Sunday there was not enough evidence against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s de facto ruler, at that time. `` I could not have briefed the vice president on <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s drug-running, drug-smuggling or money-laundering activities because we simply did not have evidence of those activities at that time and so any statement to the effect that I did brief him on such matters at that time simply is not true,'' <PERSON> Briggs </PERSON> told a news conference in <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION> The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported in its Sunday editions that <PERSON> Briggs </PERSON> had sent cables to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> about allegations of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s drug dealings, and that <PERSON> Briggs </PERSON> told <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> about the substance of those cables during a meeting on Dec. 16, 1985. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, a Republican presidential candidate, has said he knew of no clear evidence that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was involved in drugs until February. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> commands <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s Defense Forces and is the power behind the civilian government in that nation. The general was indicted by two federal grand juries in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> on drug trafficking charges and has rejected <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> demands that he resign. <PERSON> Briggs </PERSON> was ambassador to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in 1985 and is now ambassador to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. He acknowledged that there were persistent reports about <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and drug trafficking. `` Panamanian sources would come to us and say ` Why do you have dealings with this man when it is well known that he is a drug smuggler?' and our answer always was ` Provide us the evidence,' and unfortunately during the time I was in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> that evidence was not forthcoming,'' he said. `` Now I am sorry it took so long for us to get the evidence,'' he said. `` I am sorry that we were n't able to get it sooner and I am very, very glad that the evidence was available finally so that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> could be indicted. I consider him probably the most pernicious element in this hemisphere at this time.'' A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION> read a partial transcript of <PERSON> Briggs </PERSON>' news conference statements to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, quoting unidentified <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration officials, reported that a memo from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aides to the vice president before his meeting with <PERSON> Briggs </PERSON> said the meeting was to `` discuss <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> relations with <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and narcotics matters.'' <PERSON> Briggs </PERSON> said he did not have a written record of what he and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> discussed during their meeting, but he imagined it would have been the slaying of <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Spadafora </PERSON>, a critic of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, and the circumstances leading to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s ouster of elected President <PERSON> Nicolas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ardito </PERSON> <PERSON> Barletta </PERSON>. He said he doubted he would have discussed with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> the cables he was sending to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> at the time.

 After the re-election of Socialist President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jean-Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON>, head of the extreme-right <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, claimed he is the real leader of the conservative opposition. However, leaders of the moderate right said they would not consider an alliance with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. They blamed <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON> for the defeat of their candidate, Premier <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>, in the presidential runoff election. `` The fact that <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> refused to accept in any manner any concessions to the 4.4 million voters that I united condemned him to failure,'' <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON> said on national television on Sunday. The premier had made gestures during the campaign to <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON> supporters with statements about the dangers of immigration and the need to preserve the French national identity, but he also said he would not bargain for <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON>'s backing.

 In scattered violence during the French presidential election, a bus driver was shot and wounded while driving people to the polls and police dispersed Melanesian separatists blocking a street. In another development, authorities said funerals were held peacefully on Sunday on the island of <LOCATION> Ouvea </LOCATION> in this French <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> territory for Melanesian separatist kidnappers killed when police freed their hostages. In <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, the main Melanesian separatist group, the <ORGANIZATION> Kanak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, hailed the re-election of President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> on Sunday. <PERSON> Djim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ouenei </PERSON>, the group's representative, said the <LOCATION> Kanak </LOCATION> people, as native Melanesians are known, were renewing their proposal to negotiate `` to get out of this colonialist mess. Conservative Premier <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> won a record number of votes in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION>, 90.3 percent, while Socialist <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> took the rest. But in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> roundly defeated <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>. Native Melanesians make up 43 percent of the inhabitants of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION>, colonized by <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1853. Thirty-six percent are of European descent and the others are Asians and Polynesians. Many Melanesians want independence, but but a majority of the Europeans and others wish to remain part of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. Police in the capital of <LOCATION> Noumea </LOCATION> said the bus driver was hit in the legs by buckshot Sunday afternoon as he drove 15 Melanesians to a polling station in <LOCATION> Pouembout </LOCATION>, on the west coast of the main island and 150 miles north of <LOCATION> Noumea </LOCATION>. No other injuries were reported. In the town of <PERSON> Yate </PERSON> on the south end of the main island, police used tear gas to disperse a crowd of separatists who erected a barricade. The French High Commissioner reported that 14 of 128 polling stations were moved `` for reasons of public order.'' Voter turnout on the archipelego was 61.69 percent, up from 59 percent in the first round of balloting two weeks ago in which <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> also took the lion's share of the votes. The conservative Rally for the Republic in <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION>, a local spinoff of <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>'s Rally for the Republic party, controls the regional government. Separatists boycotted and attempted to disrupt the first round on April 24, but promised last week not to take similar action this time. On April 22, separatists stormed a police station on the island of <LOCATION> Ouvea </LOCATION>, northeast of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION>'s main island, killed four gendarmes and abducted others. A second group of gendarmes was abducted several days later. On Thursday, police stormed the cave where the 23 hostages were being held and killed 19 of the kidnappers. Two members of the French military assault team also were killed and five people were wounded.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Danes </PERSON> vote in a parliamentary election Tuesday that will serve as a referendum on this nation's future in the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> alliance Prime Minister <PERSON> Poul </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlueter </PERSON> called for the elections just eight months after the last vote because the socialist-dominated parliament ignored his objections and passed a resolution toughening <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>'s non-nuclear status. Under parliament's resolution, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> must notify each visiting warship that nuclear arms are barred from Danish ports in peacetime. That has been the Danish stand for 31 years, but until now it has been merely a general statement of policy. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> said such a resolution would undermine the unity of the Western alliance and could threaten the ability of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> to protect <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> in an emergency. <PERSON> Schlueter </PERSON>, leader of the minority center-right government, called for new elections rather than implement the resolution. The opposition campaign has taken on an anti-American tint, centered around the slogan: `` <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> decides for itself.'' `` If there are two people agreeing on Danish politics, it's <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>,'' says an election poster depicting the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> president and the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> prime minister in an embrace `` Forty-three years ago <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> again became part of the free world,'' counters a poster for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, a member of <PERSON> Schueter </PERSON>'s four-party center-right alliance. Polls indicate that most Danes agree with the traditional anti-nuclear position. One recent survey said 82 percent of those asked favored a nuclear-free zone in <LOCATION> Scandinavia </LOCATION>, and 46 percent said they would support the idea even if it meant <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>'s expulsion from <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> Early polls indicate that neither the conservative-led government nor the socialist opposition may emerge as a clear winner on Tuesday, and <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> could once again be governed by an unwieldy minority coalition. Surveys trying to forecast Tuesday's outcome have been inconclusive, but several have shown modest gains for the opposition partnership of the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. In last September's election, <PERSON> Schlueter </PERSON>'s coalition won 70 seats in the 179-member Folketing, and the socialist bloc took 81 seats. Each side also had two more supporters from the autonomous territories of <LOCATION> Greenland </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Faroe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. The balance of power is held by the 11-seat <ORGANIZATION> Social-Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which usually supports the government's economic policies and the opposition's foreign and defense policies. The anti-tax <ORGANIZATION> Progress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, with 9 seats, and the far-left <ORGANIZATION> Common </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Course </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, with 4 seats, make up the balance. The shape of the next government could be determined by <PERSON> Niels </PERSON> <PERSON> Helveg </PERSON> <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Social-Liberal </ORGANIZATION> leader, who could even make a bid to become prime minister in the event of a deadlock between the two traditional blocs. Three other parties are contesting the election, but none is expected to pass the minimum of 2 percent of the votes cast needed to gain a seat. Polls open at 9 a.m. for the 3.9 million eligible voters. Results should be known shortly after they close at 8 p.m. <PERSON> Schlueter </PERSON> argues that the anti-nuclear resolution could lead to a refusal by allied ships to pull into Danish ports. `` It would be totally devastating for <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>'s defense,'' he told a news conference Thursday. `` We will not accept a resolution that brings our full membership of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> into doubt,'' added Foreign Minister <PERSON> Uffe </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellemann-Jensen </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader. If the resolution is allowed to stand and visiting ships are given a letter, `` the next step would be to ask for an acknowledgement of that letter, the next step would be to demand guarantees, and the next step would be the right to inspection,'' he said on Friday.

 Shiite Moslem militias battled for control of high-rise buildings in the south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> slums today, and gunfights were reported inside a hospital. Police said 40 people were killed and 105 injured. The fighting was in its fourth straight day, with both sides using tanks, mortars and rockets. Today's casualties brought the overall toll to 129 dead and 322 wounded since the fighting began Friday between the Syrian-armed Amal militia and the Iranian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God. Most of the 18 foreign hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> are believed held in the labyrinthine slums. The fighting flared after two weekend cease-fires collapsed in the battle for control of slums that stretch for 16 square miles along <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s southern edge. The clashes began when four Amal men were killed in a street ambush and <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> blamed <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>. Gunbattles flared in the al-Sahel hospital, where a doctor said militiamen forced surgeons to operate at gunpoint on dead comrades `` to bring them to life.'' One doctor, speaking on condition of anonymity, said rival gunmen had shot it out inside the hospital. `` We've been forced many times to abandon casualties because of gunfights in the emergency ward,'' she said. Doctors confirmed allegations by both sides that wounded fighters have been dragged from ambulances and hospitals by their rivals and slaughtered. Amal, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s main ally in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> fighters, who are loyal to <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, have long been bitter foes in a struggle for control of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 1.2 million Shiites, the country's largest single sect. Police said <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> fighters, wearing red headbands, appeared to have gained considerable ground in the densely populated Ghobeiri, <ORGANIZATION> Bir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> el-Abed </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Hay </PERSON> <PERSON> Madi </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Meshrafieh </LOCATION> neighborhoods. Much of the fighting centered on high-rise buildings used by both sides as strongpoints and sniper nests. The fundamentalist <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> is believed to be the umbrella group for Shiites holding most of the kidnapped foreigners in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. There has been no word on the captives' fate since the fighting broke out. `` God willing, we will liberate <PERSON> Hay </PERSON> <PERSON> Madi </PERSON> and Bir el-Abed and free all the foreign hostages,'' said Amal fighter <PERSON> Tarek </PERSON> <PERSON> Saad </PERSON> as he trained his shoulder-fired rocket launcher at <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> positions in <LOCATION> Hay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Madi </LOCATION>. `` We know they're imprisoned there.'' Thunderous shell blasts shook <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> all night as both sides mounted grenade-throwing forays against each other's strongpoints behind barrages of fire from tanks, mortars and multi-barreled rocket launchers. <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION>'s irregulars, with green or black headbands, control most of the districts of Haret Hreik, Mreiji, <PERSON> Roweiss </PERSON>, <PERSON> Shiyah </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kasskass </PERSON>, a police spokesman said. He can not be named under standing regulations. `` <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> has established control over half of the slums. It only controlled one-third before the current fighting,'' the spokesman said. A cease-fire at midnight Saturday broke down after 16 hours. Syrian and Iranian mediators called another cease-fire for 10:30 p.m. Sunday. But the fighting raged on and intensified after midnight. The newspaper As-Safir said the current confrontation has set the stage for the Syrian army to move into the slums to disarm the two militias. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s military intelligence chief in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Ghazi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenaan </PERSON>, met with leaders of both warring factions as well as government and religious figures today. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> deployed 7,500 troops in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in February 1987 to end militia warfare in the capital. It has not sent its forces into the southern slums, a traditional Hezbollah stronghold.

 First lady <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> prevented President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> from speaking out at the height of the Iran-Contra affair because her astrologer told her the time was not right to go out in public, former White House chief of staff <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> said today. `` The president was practically immobile during that period of December 1986, January and February of'87, all because the first lady was saying no, no, no he ca n't go out,'' <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Today'' program. `` Now she used as an excuse the fact that he had a minor operation right after the Christmas holidays. But I said, ` No, this president is going to get shot down in flames. He's not out talking to the people about Iran-Contra. He should be making his own case.' But he did n't.'' In his book, `` For the Record: From Wall Street to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>,'' which went on sale today, <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> said he believes the president's contention that he knew nothing of the Iran-Contra affair, in which proceeds from secret <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms sales to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> were diverted to the Nicaraguan rebels, until told about it by Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> on Nov. 25, 1986 `` The president ... is a ruddy man, with bright red cheeks. He blanched when he heard <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s words. The color drained from his face, leaving his skin pasty white. ... Nobody who saw the president's reaction that afternoon could believe for a moment that he knew about the diversion of funds before <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> told him about it. He was the picture of a man to whom the inconceivable had happened,'' <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> wrote. He said that he urged the president to conteract the effects of the Iran-Contra affair by undertaking an active speaking schedule outside <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, but was balked by astrological advice to the first lady that `` harm would come to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> if he went out of the White House.'' `` By humoring her, we had given her control,'' he said of Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>, in his memoir, portrayed the president as a hesitant and unassertive chief executive controlled by a wife who relied heavily upon the predictions of an astrologer. Former press secretary <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON>, who also wrote a `` kiss and tell'' book about his years in the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, said today he was not aware of the first lady's reliance on astrology. `` I did n't see it and had no evidence of it,'' <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>'s `` This Morning'' show. `` I've got no reason to doubt. But I never saw any crystal balls in the Cabinet Room. From time to time, strange people did come into the White House. But I did n't know that they were astrologers, if they were.'' The White House issued a brief statement about the book on Sunday that said: `` Vindictiveness and revenge are not admirable qualities, and are not worthy of comment. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>'s attempts to defame the first lady, on Mother's Day no less, are certainly in that category.'' Asked about the White House statement, <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> responded: `` They ought to know it when they see it.''

 Sikhs inside the <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> opened fire today on nearby government security posts, police said, setting off a gun battle in which two civilians died and five paramilitary troops were injured. The Sikh extremists began firing automatic rifles at 1:15 p.m., and the troops returned fire with light machine guns, according to police superintendent <PERSON> Baldev </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>. The fighting continued for at least three hours. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> said it was not known if any militants where killed or injured in the exchange. The civilians killed in the crossfire outside the Golden Temple complex were identified by police as <PERSON> Venod </PERSON> <PERSON> Kumar </PERSON>, 30, a Hindu who worked with the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Dilip </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaur </PERSON>, an 80-year-old Sikh. Among the injured was the deputy inspector general of the paramilitary <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> S.S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Virk </PERSON>. He was out of danger after surgery for a bullet wound on his chin, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Virk </PERSON> and other senior paramilitary officers had gone to government security posts on rooftops near the shrine to look at a bunker Sikh militants were building at the western end of the Golden Temple complex. Police said the militants opened fire from at least 16 sites in the temple complex, mainly with Chinese-made AK-47 automatic rifles. The troops returned fire with light machine guns, according to <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>. Shops and businesses in bazaars around the Golden Temple closed their shutters, and an indefinite curfew was imposed on the old, walled, central part of <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION> to keep civilians indoors. More than 1,000 police and paramilitary troops were rushed to the temple to seal exits and prevent people from entering. Sikh extremists have been waging a guerrilla campaign since 1982 for more political autonomy or an independent homeland for Sikhs in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>. The Golden Temple is <LOCATION> Sikhism </LOCATION>'s holiest shrine. In June 1984, the Indian army stormed the <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> to drive out militants, and more than 1,200 people were killed. Later that year, Prime Minister <PERSON> Indira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> was assassinated by two Sikh bodguards in revenge for the raid, setting off anti-Sikh rioting in which 2,000 people died. The gun battle today was the worst in a series that began shortly after <PERSON> Jasbir </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> <PERSON> Rode </PERSON> was restored as the temple's chief priest in early March. Rode had been in custody under the government's anti-terrorism rules, but was freed in an effort by Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> to placate the extremists and lure them into negotiations. Since Rode's return, there have been persistent reports that the militants have been building bunkers and firing ports in the temple complex. The militants fired on police outside the temple last week when security forces tried to arrest a Sikh militant as he was heading for the shrine. The militant escaped and fled into the temple, but he was believed wounded. Sikhs, whose religion was founded about 500 years ago as an alternative to <LOCATION> Hinduism </LOCATION> and Islam, claim they are discriminated against by <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s majority Hindus. Sikhs make up less than 2 percent of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 800 million population but are a majority in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>. Meanwhile, five more people were reported killed by <ORGANIZATION> Sikh </ORGANIZATION> extremists in overnight attacks in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> reported. The slayings followed an attack by the radicals in neighboring <LOCATION> Haryana </LOCATION> on Saturday in which 13 Hindus were killed during a wedding party. The latest killings raised to about 940 the number of deaths blamed on the Sikh separatists this year. The rate of killings is more than twice that of 1987, when 1,000 people were killed by Sikh extremists. Most victims have been Hindus or moderate Sikhs in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled today that an Arab-American accused of inciting riots in the occupied lands must stay in jail until his deportation hearing in two weeks. Also today, Israeli troops shot and killed a Palestinian during rioting in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials say <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>, 44, helped promote the 5-month-old Arab uprising in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. At least 185 Arabs and two Israelis have been killed there since Dec. 8. The three-judge panel today set <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>'s deportation hearing for May 23, accepting a statement from Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> that <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>'s release would endanger national security. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON> denied an <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio report that the prime minister received a message from Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> objecting to <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>'s treatment. The judges today also turned down the prosecution's request to deport <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> immediately and hear his appeal in his absence. Prosecutor <PERSON> Nili </PERSON> <PERSON> Arad </PERSON> presented an affadavit that accused <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> of `` taking part in the publication of leaflets which issued ... a call for violent and hostile actions against the state by residents of the -LRB- occupied -RRB- territories.'' <PERSON> Arad </PERSON> said that if the court released <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>, he would continue these activities until his trial began. The court turned down an offer by <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>'s lawyers, <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuttab </PERSON> and <PERSON> Avraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Gal </PERSON>, to free their client in return for a promise that he would not speak out publicly and would pay for a police guard to supervise him. <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>'s American wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Nye </PERSON>, told reporters after today's hearing, `` I learned a long time ago not to be optimistic or pessimistic but to see what happens. She has denied her husband wrote a leaflet inciting violence. Awad, born in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, left for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1968 but returned in 1985. He founded the Palestinian Center for the Study of Non-Violence. Earlier today, he blew kisses to supporters as he entered the courthouse for the hearing. During a recess, he told reporters he was in the fourth day of a hunger strike. `` I feel good. I'm still fasting, but I started to drink water. I still believe in Israeli law and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> justice and I hope I wo n't be disappointed,'' he said. At the Deheishe refugee camp near <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, meanwhile, a man was fatally shot in the head today when soldiers opened fire on rock-throwing Palestinians, hospital officials and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> witnesses said. The victim was identified as <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Haniyah </PERSON>, 34. Troops fired tear gas, rubber bullets and live ammunition at dozens of Arabs who hurled rocks at soldiers and Israeli cars, said Deheishe resident <PERSON> Saed </PERSON> <PERSON> Rasi </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said three Arabs were wounded. The army said it was checking the reports. In Arab east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and the occupied territories, business was virtually shut down by the latest of dozens of general strikes called by Palestinian uprising's organizers. On Sunday, Palestinian leaders called on Arabs in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> to defy an order by the Israeli government requiring more than 300,000 residents to exchange their Israeli-issued identity cards for new documents. Palestinians alleged the order was intended to break an Arab tax boycott because only those who paid all taxes would be eligible for new cards. Israeli military sources denied this. Also Sunday, a masked assailant fatally shot a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> woman in front of her children in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> refugee camp of <LOCATION> Jenin </LOCATION>, the Israeli news agency <ORGANIZATION> Itim </ORGANIZATION> reported. Arab sources said <PERSON> Amne </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON>, 45, was suspected of collaborating with Israeli authorities.

The arrests were made Sunday at one of three locations in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> where the dissident group was holding organizational meetings, said <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitiunov </PERSON>, one of the organizers of the group, the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Mitiunov </PERSON> said police came to one location and detained 60 participants. Forty were released shortly after their arrests, he said, and 20 were held overnight. Six were released this morning, he said. About 148 people attended the group's initial meeting on Saturday to form the political organization, then broke into the smaller groups on Sunday. <PERSON> Mitiunov </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in a telephone interview that the dissidents jailed are all from outside <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. `` Those jailed were ordered to leave <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and refused,'' <PERSON> Mitiunov </PERSON> said. `` Under our law it is legal for visitors to be here three days and they had not been here that long so they had a right to remain.'' At the village of <LOCATION> Kratovo </LOCATION> outside <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, where another meeting was to be held today, `` the house was encircled by militia,'' said <PERSON> Tamara </PERSON> <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON>. `` The commanding officer of the militia said that under no circumstances would he allow the meeting to take place,'' she said. <PERSON> Yevgeniya </PERSON> <PERSON> Debryanskaya </PERSON>, who played host at the meeting where the arrests took place, said Sunday that the fledgling party drafted principles calling for a multi-party democracy, a new constitution, an independent trade union and the withdrawal of Soviet soldiers from <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the western <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION> and the Baltic states. While <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> members met, editors of 30 unofficial journals challenging the government monopoly on publishing gathered separately in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to form an organization called the <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>.

 A Roman Catholic bishop today condemned the `` murderous tactics'' of the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> in his eulogy for a <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> airman slain in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>. The Rt. Rev. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Grey </PERSON>, bishop of <LOCATION> Shrewsbury </LOCATION>, said at the requiem Mass for 20-year-old Senior Aircraftman <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Shinner </PERSON> that there could be no justification for his killing. <PERSON> Shinner </PERSON> died in a spray of <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> bullets while sitting in a car with two other British airmen outside a pub in the Dutch town of <LOCATION> Roermond </LOCATION> on May 1. An hour later, two more enlisted men were killed by an <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> car bomb at <ORGANIZATION> Nieuw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bergen </ORGANIZATION> 35 miles away.

<TEXT>
 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> today met privately with President <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanguinetti </PERSON>, the agnostic leader of this nominally Roman Catholic but highly secularized country. The pope, bundled up against a 45-degree chill on a foggy <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> fall morning, rode in a bulletproof limousine to the 75-year-old French baroque-style presidential residence in the <LOCATION> Prado </LOCATION> district, once the capital's most elegant but now a bit run-down. Aides say <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> has been buoyed by the official reception he has received in tiny <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>, population 3 million, which is considered the most secular country in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. It maintains strict separation of church and state and calls Christmas `` Families Day'' to avoid religious connotations. The pontiff, who is on the last day of his visit to <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>, today was to travel to the orange-growing city of <LOCATION> Salto </LOCATION> on the northwestern border with <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>. He is then to fly to <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Paz </PERSON>, the 2 -LCB- - mile-high capital of <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, the next country on his 12-day, four-nation pilgrimage Since arriving in <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> on Friday, the pope has taken on one of the most difficult issues in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>: how to spread the wealth controlled by a few. In a stop Sunday in <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>'s gaucho -LRB- cowboy -RRB- country, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> came up against the contrasts that have bedeviled governments for generations throughout much of <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Herds of cattle grazed peacefully on large estates outside <PERSON> Melo </PERSON>, a northeastern city of 40,000 near the Brazilian frontier that church officials say is one of the poorest regions in <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>. Speaking to a crowd of 50,000 gathered on a dirt field, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> said he was directing an appeal to `` all Catholic faithful and all Uruguayans of good will.'' `` Those who own land and other categories of wealth must take into account that there is a social mortgage on all private property,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> said in Spanish, explaining that this meant the property must be used for the good of the entire community. He cited church documents that wealth should be used to create jobs and that farmworkers should be paid enough to prevent the swelling of migrations to the cities. Nearly half of <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>'s 3 million residents live in this capital beside the River Plate. The pope also spoke out strongly for union rights, saying that those who sought to better the conditions of workers deserve `` unconditional support.'' <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> officials say they have been delighted at the turnout of government officials at papal events and by the local media's coverage of the visit President <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanguinetti </PERSON>, an agnostic, flew to <PERSON> Melo </PERSON> for the papal stopover. The church says 80 percent of the country is <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> but only about 5 percent attend Mass regularly in <LOCATION> Montevideo </LOCATION>. Divorce has been legal since 1907, separation of church and state is mandated by law, and teaching religion is banned in public schools. A <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> official, briefing reporters on grounds of anonymity, noted that two Cabinet ministers have attended each event, in <LOCATION> Montevideo </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Melo </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. `` We hope this is the start of a new climate,'' the official said. The pope's tour is his ninth to <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in his nine-year-old papacy, reflecting the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>'s interest in the region. <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is expected to contain half the world's Roman Catholics by the end of the century. There are an estimated 860 million Roman Catholics now in the world. After <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> and five days in landlocked <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, the 67-year-old pope will visit <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> before returning to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> on May 19.

 After getting a replacement for a juror described as `` incoherent,'' the jury returned to court today for a sixth day of deliberations on whether <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> should die for his part in the six 1973 slayings of the <PERSON> Alday </PERSON> family. Superior Court Judge <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> on Sunday morning excused a juror and replaced her with one of three remaining alternates. At 3:30 p.m., he sent the jurors back to their hotel with instructions to return today. The jury met briefly with <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> this morning before resuming its talks. Defense attorney <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> West </PERSON> moved again Sunday for <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> to declare the jury deadlocked. That would bring <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> an automatic life sentence. <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> was one of three men originally convicted and sentenced to die for the 1973 slayings of six members of the <PERSON> Ned </PERSON> <PERSON> Alday </PERSON> family in <LOCATION> Seminole </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. The verdicts were thrown out in 1985 by a federal appeals court which cited pretrial publicity. The juror who was excused did not accompany the other jurors to the DeKalb County Courthouse Sunday morning. She arrived separately and then testified before <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>. Much of her testimony was inaudible. Several times, she said, `` They put a bug in my ear. Remember <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Alday </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Alday </PERSON> was raped and killed in a field near the mobile home where her husband, <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Alday </PERSON>, and four other Alday men were killed on May 14, 1973. A deputy assigned to watch the sequestered jurors testified the juror `` was mumbling nonsense. She was not coherent. She is not physically or mentally capable to continue.'' The deputy said the woman could be made to return to the jury only by force. The jury last Monday convicted <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> of six counts of murder. On Wednesday, the jurors began deliberating whether he should be sentenced to death or life in prison. The woman replaced Sunday was the second juror to be replaced by one of the four alternates. <PERSON> West </PERSON> said Sunday he believes the case may now be the longest penalty deliberation in recent <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> history. <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> has given no indication when he might halt deliberations. On Saturday, he gave the jurors a second set of instructions and told them he wants them to reach a decision. One of the other two men originally sentenced to death, <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Isaacs </PERSON>, was convicted a second time in January and again condemned to die. The third defendant, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Elder </PERSON> <PERSON> Dungee </PERSON>, is to be retried later in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> spent the night at the home of an unemployed coal miner, then declared at a rally today that his message of economic equality is crossing racial lines in the nation's depressed areas. Democratic rival <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> took a break from the rigors of the presidential race by tending to business at home today, one day before <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, along with <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, has its primary. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who spent Sunday night at the home of Junior and <PERSON> Becky </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, said that in the poorer sections of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> his message is well-received _ even in a town such as all-white <PERSON> Arnett </PERSON>. `` They have their race, but they do n't jobs,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` They have their race, but they do n't have health insurance. They have their race, but they do n't have hot and cold running water. `` Their race does not address those needs.'' The town of <PERSON> Arnett </PERSON> has only 300 residents, but more than 500 people showed up to greet <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> when he arrived at the Cook home Sunday night. `` The overwhelming number ... were very favorable and very supportive,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said, though <PERSON> Becky </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> said some `` made some smurky remarks.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said of the detractors, `` We have to displace people's fears with security and give them assurances they've never had before. On Sunday, speaking at Tri-State Airport near <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION> and later at a rally in <LOCATION> Beckley </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> criticized both <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, asking, `` What is Reaganomics but reverse <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hood </PERSON>? What is Reaganomics but union-busting?'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also reacted to reports that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was briefed three years ago about a Panamanian drug connection. The Democratic candidate said, `` The reason Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has not led the charge to fight drugs is because he knew of the administration's dealings with the drug dealers.'' He called <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s alleged knowledge of contacts between Panamanian strongman <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and drug dealers `` intolerable.'' Meanwhile, however, in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, the former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> <PERSON> Briggs </PERSON>, denied telling <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as early as 1985 that Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> may have been involved in drug trafficking. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported in its Sunday editions that <PERSON> Briggs </PERSON> had sent cables to the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> about allegations of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s drug dealings, and that <PERSON> Briggs </PERSON> had told <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> the substance of those cables on Dec. 16, 1985. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> front-runner, and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who has the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination locked up, were taking today off from campaigning, with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> back home in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Beckley </LOCATION>, an obviously weary <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> occasionally stumbled over his words. Even so, he managed repeatedly to bring the crowd to its feet _ despite a two-hour wait for the candidate. A town heavily dependent on the coal industry, <PERSON> Beckley </PERSON> is the site of some of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s worst economic conditions, and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> referred to that situation in attacking Reaganomics. `` Profits are up, wages are down. Plants are closed, mines are closed _ and workers are abandoned,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. He attacked `` absentee coal mine companies,'' which he said `` drain the coal and drain the coal miner, strip the soil and strip the people, then leave you abandoned.'' He advocated a <ORGANIZATION> Pan-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> to coordinate policies for oil from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, coal from <LOCATION> Appalachia </LOCATION>, and hydro and solar power. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> ended his Beckley speech by citing President <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>, who he noted used a wheelchair. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> then climbed through the crowd to greet a disabled woman, <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lilly </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION>, who had listened to his speech while sitting in a wheelchair.

 An <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> naturalist said today he was `` very lucky'' to survive an attack by a rhinoceros that charged and badly wounded him while he was working in the jungle with his 5-year-old son. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 46, of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, was attacked Saturday while on a research outing with his son <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> and local hunters. He told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> he hoped to return to his work soon in southern <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>. `` I was very lucky ... it -LRB- the rhinoceros -RRB- did not open my abdominal cavity,'' he said. `` I hope to be out of the hospital in a couple of weeks' time.'' The <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> researcher was taken to the hospital in <LOCATION> Patan </LOCATION>, south of <LOCATION> Katmandu </LOCATION>, by army helicopter. His wife, <PERSON> Francie </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuthbert-Smith </PERSON>, a bird specialist at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION>, said of her husband plans to return to work: `` He is always happiest when he works in the <LOCATION> Chitwan </LOCATION> jungles.'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> set up camp at <LOCATION> Sauraha </LOCATION> village, near the <LOCATION> Royal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chitwan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, 75 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Katmandu </LOCATION>, early last month. His wife and two sons _ <PERSON> Alex </PERSON>, 5; and a month-old baby _ joined him March 28. The rhinoceros attacked while <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> was working in the jungle about 160 feet from their living quarters. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said his party was setting traps to catch small animals for research when the rhinoceros appeared. `` We did not hear the sounds of any animal on that morning,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. `` But all of sudden, I saw a rhino rushing towards -LRB- me -RRB- ... charging from a distance of about 15 feet. `` I turned around and started to run. But I realized that I could not escape, so I used my hands ... pushing to keep the animal away. `` It gored my chest,'' he said. `` The animal hit me about 12 times. Sometimes I was able to roll. I did -LRB- this so -RRB- ... the animal would miss me.'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> received four major wounds to his head, chest, leg and buttocks.

<HEAD>Fire Erupts in Electric Plant, Causing Roof to Collapse</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PALATKA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A fire whose smoke was visible for 40 miles roared through a coal-powered electric plant near here today, causing a roof to collapse, but no serious injuries were reported. The extent of damages in the $ 1.2 billion plant, which opened in 1984, was unclear, said fire dispatcher <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> <PERSON> Norton </PERSON>. No disruption in service to utility customers was expected. The fire erupted in a system that keeps hydrogen gas from escaping into the atmosphere, according to <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Fela </PERSON>, public affairs representative for <ORGANIZATION> Seminole </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION>. Hydrogen gas is a standard coolant for electric generators. One person, believed a worker at the <ORGANIZATION> Seminole </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plant </ORGANIZATION>, was treated at the scene for unknown injuries, said Capt. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, shift commander at the <ORGANIZATION> Palatka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Another person earlier unaccounted for was found, <PERSON> Norton </PERSON> said. A plume of smoke was visible in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, about 40 miles north of the plant. At least 30 fire units from the local department and surrounding counties were called to the scene after the fire was reported about 5 a.m., <PERSON> White </PERSON> said. More than 100 fire, rescue and law enforcement officers were called to help battle the blaze. `` It is contained from what we are told,'' Major <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Usina </PERSON> with the <ORGANIZATION> Putnam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said shortly after 9 a.m. The two coal-fired generators where the fire erupted are located on a 2,000-acre site six miles north of <LOCATION> Palatka </LOCATION> off <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 17. The fire erupted on the second floor of the six-story main plant of the 600-megawatt facility after the hydrogen leak developed on one of the two turbines, officials said.

 Cashiered army Gen. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s most-wanted military fugitive, was extradited from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> today to face trial for the murders of suspected leftists in the 1970s. The extradition was ordered April 27 in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> <PERSON> Jensen </PERSON>, who ruled <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> could be tried in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> on charges of 39 murders allegedly committed by troops under his command. If convicted, the maximum sentence is life in prison. The 64-year-old former general fled <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> in 1984 and was arrested by federal marshals in <LOCATION> Foster </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> suburb, where he has been living under an assumed name. Federal Police Chief <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Pirker </PERSON> confirmed that <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> arrived at Ezeira International Airport at 9:05 a.m. aboard an <ORGANIZATION> Aerolinas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Argentinas </ORGANIZATION> flight from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Pirker </PERSON> said <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> was accompanied by five guards, but he refused to provide further details. The handcuffed prisoner was escorted off the plane by federal police officers, witnesses said, was put aboard an armored vehicle and taken to federal police headquarters in downtown <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> was stripped of his military rank in April 1984 after he was declared `` in rebellion'' when he failed to appear before a military tribunal for questioning in connection with the abduction, torture and murder of suspected leftists. At least 9,000 Argentines disappeared in a so-called `` dirty war'' waged against leftists by the military regime that seized power in 1976 after ousting former President <PERSON> Isabel </PERSON> <PERSON> Peron </PERSON>. <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>'s trial was personally ordered by President <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> shortly after he took office in December 1983, ending nearly eight years of rightist military rule. <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> was commander of the Buenos Aires-based 1st <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> from 1976 to 1978, when he was promoted to head of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>. He retired in 1981 and was named president of the state oil monopoly <ORGANIZATION> Yacimientos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroliferos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fiscales </ORGANIZATION>, a post he held until 1982. <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> sought <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>'s extradition on 43 separate charges of murder. He also has been accused of 635 cases of human rights abuse as well as misappropriation of more than $ 2 million while he headed the state oil monopoly. In approving <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>'s extradition, <PERSON> Jensen </PERSON> ruled he could be tried on 39 murder murders, as well as an additional charge of forging a passport renewal. But the judge rejected the four other murder charges after ruling that identification of the victims was inadequate. He also ordered the dismissal of 23 kidnapping charges, saying the 5-year legal deadline for filing the charges expired in 1984. Under the extradition law, <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> can be tried only on charges for which extradition is approved.

<TEXT>
 Two American physicians have been allowed to perform an autopsy on a political activist and visit a jailed dissident in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, apparently the first time a Soviet-bloc country has agreed to such concessions. The doctors, part of the Somerville-based <ORGANIZATION> Physicians </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>, performed an autopsy last Wednesday on <PERSON> Pavel </PERSON> <PERSON> Wonka </PERSON>, a 35-year-old imprisoned dissident who died April 26. <PERSON> Wonka </PERSON> had been arrested in 1986 for his political activities, among them running for office, human rights officials said. <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Fine </PERSON>, executive director of the <LOCATION> Somerville </LOCATION> organization, said the Czech government allowed the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> doctors into the country after they requested permission to perform an autopsy. In January, one <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> doctor from the group visited <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> in the hope of meeting with <PERSON> Wonka </PERSON> but it could not be arranged at that time, Fine said. Fine said the Czech government did not explain why they allowed the doctors into the country but `` it's speculated'' that because Czech officials had already completed an autopsy on <PERSON> Wonka </PERSON>, they believed they had nothing to hide. Both Fine and the <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> Watch human rights monitoring organization in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> said they believed no other Soviet-bloc country had permitted American physicians such access. Doctors <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirschner </PERSON>, who performed the autopsy, said they found no evidence of torture or beatings and said the probable cause of death was pulmonary emboli, or blood clots on the lung. But Fine said it was unusual for a 35-year-old man to die from the disorder and speculated that harsh prison conditions may have contributed to <PERSON> Wonka </PERSON>'s death. After performing the autopsy, the two doctors also spent 90 minutes with <PERSON> Jiri </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>, 36, who is serving a prison term of undetermined length on charges of slander against the state.

 President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, who steamrolled to re-election over conservative Premier <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>, faces the task of forming a new Socialist-led government while the right controls the parliament. <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> offered to resign Tuesday, and was awaiting a response from the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> president, sources in <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>'s office said today. <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> lost to <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> in runoff voting Sunday. Final results from the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> showed <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> with 54 percent of the vote to <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>'s 46 percent. The leading candidate to succeed the premier appeared to be <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON>, a former agriculture minister and <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> member. Other possibilities were former finance ministers <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Delors </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Beregovoy </PERSON>. The sources in the premier's office, speaking on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>'s chief of staff <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Ulrich </PERSON> called <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>'s advisers to propose to transfer the reins of government on Tuesday afternoon. There was no immediate indication from <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> on whether he would be ready to name a successor so soon. Reporters who gathered at <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>'s Hotel Matignon offices on the <LOCATION> Left </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> saw aides busily packing up files in cardboard boxes and plastic sacks, to clear the way for the new premier's staff. The financial markets responded favorably this morning to the election results. The French franc was steady to higher in early trading while the stock market was steady to higher in calm trading shortly after the exchange opened. The general market indicator was up 1.06 percent after 30 minutes of trading. Currency traders said the franc's steady opening level was expected since <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>'s economic policies are not viewed as differing widely from <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>'s. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, 71, is the first president elected twice by popular vote. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaulle </PERSON> was elected in 1958 and 1965, and two other men served twice. But before a 1962 constitutional amendment, French presidents always were chosen by indirect election. Unlike 1981, when Socialists danced at the Bastille to mark a historic victory for the left, victory celebrations this year were subdued. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> supporters did honk their car horns along the Champs-Elysees, and 40,000 people waved <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> flags and rallied at the Place de la Republique. In the first round of elections on April 24, <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> won 34.1 percent of the vote to lead a field of nine candidates. <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> was second with 19.9 percent. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>'s election to a new seven-year term puts an end to two years of uneasy `` cohabitation'' between a <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> president and a rightist premier. But the immediate future may be even more confusing. To govern, <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>'s premier could form a coalition of minority Socialists, who hold 215 seats in the 573-seat parliament, with some centrist deputies now allied with the right. Or, he could ask the president to dissolve the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> and hold new elections. More likely, the new premier will try to survive as head of a minority government without any formal coalition, avoiding defeat in the hostile assembly by steering clear of controversial issues for several months. The one significant program <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>'s aides have said he would pursue is re-establishment of a wealth tax, with the proceeds used to pay most of the cost of a minimum guaranteed income of about $ 350 per month. In an interview published Friday in the leftist magazine <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Nouvel </PERSON> <PERSON> Observateur </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> said <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> needs to increase investment in education, the economy, social programs and the building of a united <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` In all these areas, the state has a major role to play,'' he said. `` But we ca n't expect everything from it. The final responsibility falls to business. We need a new generation of business leaders who understand that it is the quality of their products and the competitivity of their prices that will bring success.'' But <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Perigot </PERSON>, head of the French employers association, said his members will be keeping a close eye on the new government's moves. `` I will be watching that the next government pursues and expands policies favorable to the competitivity of business,'' <PERSON> Perigot </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Jean-Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON> said Sunday that <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> was `` condemned to failure'' because he refused to do enough to attract the front's extreme-right supporters. The strength of <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON>, who drew 14.4 percent of the vote in the election's first round, increased speculation that some pro-Chirac centrists would join a coalition with the Socialists. <PERSON> Simone </PERSON> <PERSON> Veil </PERSON>, health minister under former center-right President <PERSON> Valery </PERSON> <PERSON> Giscard </PERSON> d'Estaing, said she saw `` no problem in principle'' in a governing alliance between centrists and Socialists. Many centrist leaders, though, ruled out supporting a Socialist-led government. `` We have absolutely no intention of making a pact of alliance with Socialism,'' said Culture Minister <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Leotard </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the largest component of the center-right <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> coalition.

 A swarm of tornadoes and powerful storms struck the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> with high winds and hail, killing a construction worker, damaging roofs, knocking down power lines and leaving thousands blacked out today. More than 80 tornadoes or tornado-like storms touched down Sunday _ 32 in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, 25 in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and 22 in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and one each in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, and at least 160 reports of thunderstorms with wind gusts over 50 mph, some with baseball-sized hail, the weather service said. One man, a 39-year-old construction worker, was killed Sunday night when a house he was building collapsed on him in high winds in Crown Point, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, about 15 miles south of <PERSON> Gary </PERSON>, officials said today. Sunday marked the region's second day of violent weather. In rural <LOCATION> Gretna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, a 29-year-old woman and her 2-year-old daughter died after a tornado struck their mobile home Saturday night. Storm damage reports covered eastern <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, northeast <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, from <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> through southern <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and western <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>. In eastern <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, more than 5,000 <ORGANIZATION> Iowa-Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> customers were without power for several hours Sunday, and several thousand <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> And </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Light </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> customers were blacked out in the <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION> area. A car show near <LOCATION> Rockford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, ended as 81-mph winds tossed tents, debris, and portable toilets. `` One outhouse flew right past me and then I got hit by another one as I was running away,'' said <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunlop </PERSON>, 21. The winds toppled a 60-foot-by-180-foot big top tent and pulled out dozens of metal stakes that were driven into the ground. A sign reading, `` Not responsible for damage,'' was all that remained standing. At <LOCATION> Winsome </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, a nearby apartment complex, high winds lifted a 10-car garage away from the vehicles it sheltered and threw it into another building. In the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> area, winds gusted up to 55 mph, downing trees and wires. <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> officials said high winds caused electricity to be cut off to about 40,000 people in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> area, but by midmorning power had been restored to all but about 6,000 customers. An air traffic controller at <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s Midway Airport complained of a sandstorm as strong winds swept through the city. Midway and O'Hare airport officials said some flights were delayed by the storm. <PERSON> Mort </PERSON> <PERSON> Edelstein </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, said the weather-related problems were compounded by a major fire at an <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> switching center in suburban <LOCATION> Hinsdale </LOCATION>. `` The regular telephone lines linking the Chicago-area -LRB- air -RRB- control center in <LOCATION> Aurora </LOCATION> with the towers at Midway and <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> go through <LOCATION> Hinsdale </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Edelstein </PERSON> explained. `` Both towers switched immediately to backup communications systems, but the bad weather was nearing Midway, so approaches there were stopped.'' <PERSON> Edelstein </PERSON> said that after the worst of the weather passed, planes were allowed to take off from Midway, and the airport was reopened to approaching flights after several hours. There was little effect on O'Hare, he said. A tornado touched down near <LOCATION> Elwood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, southwest of <LOCATION> Joliet </LOCATION> shortly after 7 p.m. Sunday, tearing the roof off a condominium, but no injuries were reportd, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. In <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION>, high winds ripped part of the roof off a popular seafood restaurant, doing an estimated $ 200,000 damage. Authorities said about 225 diners were inside the restaurant at the time, but no one was injured. In north-central <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, two people were hospitalized with injuries after high winds with rain and hail struck their mobile homes in Marathon County. The extent of their injuries was not immediately known. `` We've had several roofs blown off, power lines knocked down, numerous reports of trees down, I'd say 20 or 30 reports,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Burbank </PERSON>, a civil defense official for <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, just south of Marathon. Thunderstorms with high winds rumbled across the northern half of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> on Sunday, damaging buildings in <LOCATION> Benton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and injuring one person when a mobile home was blown over in <LOCATION> Wabash </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, authorities said. A tornado with ice cube-size hail brought down trees and power lines Sunday near <LOCATION> Arkadelphia </LOCATION> in southwest <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, but no injuries were reported.

 Education Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, a frequent critic of low standards in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s schools and colleges, announced today he will leave President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s Cabinet in mid-September. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, often a magnet for controversy during his 3 -LCB- - year stint, signalled last month that he intended to step down in the fall, a few months before the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration draws to a close <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s spokesman, <PERSON> Loye </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, issued the following statement: `` Secretary <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> met today with the president and subsequently with <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> staff to say that he intends to leave his position in mid-September. He expressed his gratitude to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for the opportunity to serve in his Cabinet. The secretary reiterated to his staff his intention to continue at ` full speed ahead' during the next few months.'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> told the staff he had recommended that <PERSON> Linus </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, the undersecretary of education and a former superintendent of schools in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, be nominated to fill the post for the final months of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s term. There was no immediate word from the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, however, on who <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would nominate. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> was unavailable for further comment. He told the staff and the president that he wants to do some speaking and write a book. In a jocular reference to the furor over former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> chief of staff <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>'s memoirs, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> `` said to the president, ` Not that kind of book. A book about education,''' his spokesman related. What lies ahead for the brash, combative <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, who has clashed repeatedly with teachers' unions, quarreled with the surgeon general over AIDS education, accused college presidents of being greedy and upbraided <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> for changes in their curriculum? <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said after delivering the commencement address Saturday at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> that he has n't made any definite plans. But he is likely to hit the lecture circuit and says he wants to write a book capsulizing his critiques of the quality of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s schools and colleges <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, who converted from the Democratic to the Republican party on May Day in 1986, has already proven a big draw on the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> fund-raising circuit, where he has been much in demand as an after-dinner speaker. One speculated post is apparently not in the cards: the vice-presidency on <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s tickets. Although <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> is widely believed to have had his eye on that spot, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been conspicuously silent about <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> during all his talk about being `` the education president.'' Aids to <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, who asked not to be identified, said they have had virtually no contacts with the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> camp in recent months, and <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> is not expecting to play any formal role in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign. But <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> is expected to attend his first Republican convention in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> this August, where party chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Fahrenkopf </PERSON> has asked him to be on hand for the platform deliberations, spokesman <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. In the past three years, according to the trade publication Education Week, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> has spoken at 63 Republican functions across the country. He has been a peripatetic Cabinet officer, visiting nearly 100 elementary and secondary schools and 50 campuses, and giving dozens of speeches to school groups. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, 44, was chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Humanities </ORGANIZATION> for two years before succeeding T.H. Bell in the Cabinet. Previously, he ran a humanities think-tank in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and taught at several universities. He holds both a Ph.D. in philosophy from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> and a law degree from <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>. He has been a relative `` pauper'' in <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s inner circle, renting, not owning, a home in a pricey suburban <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> neighborhood.

<TEXT>
 Two years ago, in his State of the Union message, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> launched a venture to take aviation into the 21st century. `` We are going forward with research on a new Orient Express that could, by the end of the next decade, take off from <LOCATION> Dulles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> -LRB- outside <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> -RRB-, accelerate up to 25 times the speed of sound, attaining low Earth orbit or flying to <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> within two hours,'' he said. Research on an aerospace plane already had been going on for years in the part of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> that gets little public attention _ <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s first A, for aeronautics, sometimes also known as the little A. `` We are called the space agency by many, probably including yourself,'' <PERSON> Jeremiah </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Creedon </PERSON>, the director for flight systems at the <ORGANIZATION> Langley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, told a visitor. `` Many of us here think the -LRB- aeronautics -RRB- A is a large one.'' Together with other <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> research centers _ Ames and <PERSON> Dryden </PERSON> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> _ <LOCATION> Langley </LOCATION>'s business is to develop technology and to pass it on, without cost, to aircraft companies. Few planes fly today without engines, designs, materials and structures conceived at <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>. No single company alone could afford the agency's $ 2 billion investment in wind tunnels. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s rosy prediction followed years of research by <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> engineers before they decided that the aerospace plane, dubbed the X-30, was even possible. In the summer of 1990, engineers will decide whether to actually build the X-30. If the answer is yes, it could begin flight tests that would finish when the 21st century is ushered in. It will be the largest experimental aircraft project ever undertaken by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, costing $ 3.3 billion. The idea of the X-30 is to develop technologies that will be useful for planes at a slower speed _ such as 3 -LCB- times the speed of sound, or Mach 3.5. The military, and perhaps package delivery firms such as <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parcel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, are the only ones that have use for a plane flying 25 times the speed of sound. `` There is tremendous potential for all kinds of vehicles operating at high Mach numbers,'' said <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Dwoyer </PERSON>, manager of hypersonic technology at <LOCATION> Langley </LOCATION>. `` The national aerospace program is aimed at an experimental aircraft to demonstrate technologies for this family of hypersonic aircraft.'' Although the big airplane manufacturers have little interest in building a Mach 25 plane, they do want a craft capable of flying between <ORGANIZATION> Mach </ORGANIZATION> 2 and <ORGANIZATION> Mach </ORGANIZATION> 3.5, for the years 2000 to 2010. At Mach 2.7, a trip from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> would take just under four hours. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> did research in the 1960s on a supersonic transport, the SST, but dropped the program in 1970 because of costs and environmental concerns. `` The nation essentially allowed its entire research and technology base in hypersonics to disappear,'' said <PERSON> Dwoyer </PERSON>. `` We are bringing tunnels on line that have n't operated in almost 20 years with instrumentation systems that are 20 years-plus old.'' Meanwhile, the British and French produced the Concorde, capable of twice the speed of sound. The Concorde was designed with 1960s technology and can barely carry enough fuel to make it from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> across the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>. The business of the future is with the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rim </LOCATION> _ <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> _ where a fast, 6,000-mile airplane is needed. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, director of aeronautics at <LOCATION> Langley </LOCATION>, sees a real need for a long-range SST. The airlines that serve that market are pushing hard, he said. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> are trying to determine how many Mach 3.5 planes might be needed by the year 2000. `` It looks like it's on the order of 300 to 400 airplanes for the world market,'' said <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> _ holding out the prospect of a world market for an American plane that would help untilt the trade balance. But the British, the French, the Soviets and the Japanese also have ambitious aeronautics programs. Despite such competition, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> treats its aeronautics limb as a poor relative. Out of a $ 9 billion <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> budget, aeronautics R & amp; D this year gets only $ 430 million; $ 53 million of that is earmarked for the aerospace plane. The money issue is a sensitive one at <LOCATION> Langley </LOCATION>. `` I think we are grossly underfunded,'' said <PERSON> Dwoyer </PERSON>. `` On a $ 400-million-a-year program, we can not maintain our capability.'' Until 1970, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> jet transport industry had 90 percent of the long-range market. Now that's down to 70 percent. `` For 70 years you could go to any airport in the world and look out on the ramp and you see ` Made in the <LOCATION> U.S.A. </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said. Now the European-built <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION>, a superb plane, can be seen at most airports, too.

 Suspected Kurdish guerrillas raided a hamlet near the Syrian border and killed 11 villagers, including eight children, the <ORGANIZATION> Anatolia </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported Monday. The semi-official agency also said security forces found the bodies of three villagers kidnapped by the rebels on Saturday after the guerrillas killed another 11 people during a raid on a township. It said the bodies were found near the hamlets of <LOCATION> Tarakli </LOCATION> and Uckardesler. A band of rebels raided Behmenin hamlet in the Taskoyu village late Sunday and sprayed a villager's house with automatic gunfire, killing the 11 people inside, the agency said. A 2-month-old infant was among the dead. Sunday's attack was similar to the one Saturday during which rebels affiliated with the <ORGANIZATION> Kurdish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> raided a township 62 miles from <LOCATION> Taskoyu </LOCATION>. In the past, the rebels have aimed such raids at civilians suspected of collaborating with Turkish security forces. The Kurdish party seeks to set up an independent Marxist state in parts of eastern and southeastern <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. About 800 civilians and soliders and about the same number of Kurdish insurgents have been killed since the Kurdish guerrillas started hit-and-run attacks in 1984. Ethnic Kurds make up about one-fifth of <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>'s 52 million people.

 Lawyers for a man accused of killing 16 people, including 14 members of his family, have decided against a defense based on the insanity plea. Prosecutors have pledged to seek the death penalty. Juror selection began today in the murder trial of <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>, 47, a retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> master sergeant. He's charged with killing two people during a 45-minute shooting spree Dec. 28 in <LOCATION> Russellville </LOCATION>. `` We plead not guilty and we're just going to make them prove their case,'' defense attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said Sunday. `` We're just going to see that they do n't get out of line, that they give him a fair trial. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said he expected jury selection to last two days, and that testimony would take three days. It was only after <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> surrendered in connection with the two killings that police found the bodies of his wife and 13 children, grandchildren and in-laws at his home in rural <LOCATION> Pope </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. He faces a July 18 trial on murder charges for those killings. Tests on <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> found no evidence of a problem such as a brain tumor that could have affected his behavior, doctors said. Today's trial is for the deaths of a former co-worker, <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kendrick </PERSON>, 24, who officials say spurned <PERSON> Dimmons </PERSON>' advances a year before she was killed, and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaffin </PERSON>, 33, apparently killed by chance. `` It was a cruel and senseless act that was committed and the death penalty would certainly be justified,'' prosecutor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bynum </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> could be sentenced to die or to life in prison without parole if convicted. He also faces five counts of attempted murder and one count of kidnapping, but <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> hopes to get those charges incorporated into the two murder charges. The trial has been moved 50 miles to this town of 3,500 people because of pretrial publicity, yet <PERSON> Bynum </PERSON>, <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said, has `` stated emphatically he has no intention of bringing up'' the 14 other deaths during the trial. `` I do n't think he can get a fair trial anywhere in <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> because of all the pretrial publicity,'' <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bynum </PERSON> said an impartial jury can be found in <LOCATION> Franklin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, but acknowledged, `` I do n't expect to find a juror who has n't heard about the case.'' After <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>' arrest, deputies went to his home and found the bodies of five relatives, including two of his children and their spouses. Four had been shot and <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>' 11-year-old granddaughter, had been strangled. They apparently died after arriving for a Christmas gathering. The next day, police found seven bodies, including <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>' other children and his wife, <PERSON> Becky </PERSON>, in a shallow, kerosene-soaked grave. Some had been shot, others strangled, apparently before Christmas, police said. They also found the strangled bodies of two infant boys in trunks of abandoned cars on <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>' land. The gun that killed Miss <PERSON> Kendrick </PERSON> and <PERSON> Chaffin </PERSON> had been used to kill some of <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>' relatives, ballistics experts said. Feelings are running high in this east-central <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> county. Sheriff <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> said 18 to 20 officers will provide court security and spectators will have to pass through a metal detector to enter the courtroom. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Woodline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Woodline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> Freight in <LOCATION> Russellville </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> surrendered, said last week it was `` unfortunate we have to go through the motions'' of a trial. `` I would be severely upset if he were found innocent,'' <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> said. `` On the other hand, if he were found innocent, he would n't make it far past the front door of the court.

 <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> has cut its ties with the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> because the international group refused to hand over its food supplies in the war-torn north. Ethiopian <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Dawit </PERSON> <PERSON> Zewdie </PERSON> announced the break Sunday in a speech marking Red Cross Day and the 125th anniversary of the international <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> movement. The Geneva-based <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> was part of a massive relief effort to save an estimated 7 million Ethiopians from starvation following severe crop failures last year. More than 3 million of those people are in the northern provinces of <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION> and Tigre, where the international committee was feeding about 500,000 people until last month when the government expelled all foreign aid workers from the provinces, citing security reasons. The government is battling two separate insurgencies in the region. Before leaving, international <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> workers locked up about 53,000 metric tons of food and equipment, including approximately 40 trucks. <PERSON> Jean-Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Fresard </PERSON>, the international body's chief delegate in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, said the action was according to the group's general policy. `` Supplies are never handed over ... without having our expatriate presence to monitor and control the operation,'' Fresard said in a telephone interview. <PERSON> Fresard </PERSON> said the move by the <ORGANIZATION> Ethopian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> had been expected. `` They wanted to go on with the joint agreement only if we handed over all our supplies,'' said <PERSON> Fresard </PERSON>. `` We could n't do that.'' It was not immediately clear what practical effect the break will have, since the government expulsion last month put a stop to international <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> operations in <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION> and Tigre. <PERSON> Fresard </PERSON> said he did not believe it would affect operations in <LOCATION> Gondar </LOCATION>, where the international organization is feeding 100,000 people and hopes eventually to reach 230,000 drought victims. <PERSON> Bekele </PERSON> <PERSON> Geleta </PERSON>, secretary-general of the Ethiopian <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, said he was unsure whether the Ethopian group would allow the international <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> to go on working in <LOCATION> Gondar </LOCATION>. `` We would like to continue, but the <ORGANIZATION> ICRC </ORGANIZATION> is causing a lot of problems,'' he said. Relations between the international <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Ethiopian </LOCATION> government have deteriorated since the expulsions. <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> has accused the international group of running covert operations in the north and of supporting guerrillas who have been fighting for 27 years in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s longest civil war in <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION>. The international <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, which has an international mandate under the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> Convention to operate in regions of conflict, has maintained an office in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> since the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> nation fought a full-scale war with <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION> in 1977-78.

<TEXT>
 Paparazzi and star-watchers may be disappointed when the 41st <ORGANIZATION> Cannes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Festival </ORGANIZATION> opens Wednesday _ it's going back to basics. Apart from the participation of <PERSON> Clint </PERSON> <PERSON> Eastwood </PERSON> and possibly <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Redford </PERSON> _ both as directors rather than actors _ the famed festival is being billed this year as a cozy gathering of movie buffs and professionals After the 40th anniversary extravaganza last year, some film purists find the change a welcome return to the style of previous festivals, when the films themselves outshined the stars, fancy receptions and big deals being signed. The choice facing the <LOCATION> Cannes </LOCATION> jury each year is whether to select films which are certain to be a commercial success, or to innovate and bring some newcomers into the limelight. It is difficult to achieve the right balance. By favoring less commercial films, the Festival runs the risk of losing the big ones completely. If it loses, a prestigious, high-budget film loses a lot, but a low-budget film can only gain if it wins a glittering prize at the world-famous festival. Festival officials say the focus this year will be on a search for the talent of tomorrow. The jury has decided to `` help the cinema build its future,'' festival President <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Viot </PERSON> said at a recent news conference. Fifteen countries are represented by 21 films in the main competition. This year's festival will be an opportunity for film makers outside the commercial circuit to show their worth. The jury's selection includes many films by young directors and works from countries just beginning to gain a reputation for their movie industries For example, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> makes its <LOCATION> Cannes </LOCATION> debut with `` King of Children'' by <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaige </PERSON>, and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> is represented by <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>'s `` The Navigator.'' One of two French entries is `` Chocolat,'' a story of colonial life in the African Cameroons. It is the first full-length film of <PERSON> Claire </PERSON> <PERSON> Denis </PERSON>, who made her mark as assistant to German New Wave film maker <PERSON> Wim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wenders </PERSON>. `` A World Apart,'' a British film directed by <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Menges </PERSON>, tells the story of apartheid in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Menges </PERSON> made his name as a director of photography, working on films such as <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Joffe </PERSON>'s `` Mission.'' A more familiar name on the list of entrants is that of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> director and scenarist <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Schrader </PERSON>. Known for `` American Gigolo'' and `` <PERSON> Mishima </PERSON>,'' he is represented in <LOCATION> Cannes </LOCATION> by `` Patty,'' based on the 1974 kidnapping of <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Hearst </PERSON>, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Randolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Hearst </PERSON>'s granddaughter Despite the many litte-known names, stargazers will still have a chance of seeing a few <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> greats. Director <PERSON> Clint </PERSON> <PERSON> Eastwood </PERSON> is expected to present `` Bird,'' a biography of the alto sax player <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> `` Bird'' <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Redford </PERSON>, who has been in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> showing some of his films, may appear in <LOCATION> Cannes </LOCATION> to present his new film `` The Milagro Beanfield War.'' The feature tells the story of a tiny village in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, where residents take up arms against big business and the establishment. In an effort to cater to true movie lovers, the organizers have even restricted the presence of television at this year's festival. Critics said the 1987 festival became a vehicle for the small screen. Many televised variety shows used the festival as a backdrop. Said Viot: `` We do not want the festival to become the battleground for a -LRB- television -RRB- ratings war.''

 A moderate earthquake rattled portions of south-central <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> early Monday, but there were no immediate reports of damage or injuries, the <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tsunami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> reported. The 8:33 a.m. temblor measured 4.7 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale, the center reported. The quake was centered about 20 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>, and was felt strongly in that city, said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sokolowski </PERSON>, head of the warning center. The <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase in magnitude. Thus, a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 time stronger than one of 6.5. An earthquake of magnitude 3.5 can cause slight damage, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage, 6 severe damage. A magnitude 7 quake is a major earthquake, capable of widespread damage; 8 is a `` great'' quake capable of tremendous damage.

<HEAD>New Rules on Gasoline Evaporation May Help Clean Up Hidden Air
Polluter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Cities may have been made significantly smoggier than previously predicted by an unrecognized form of auto pollution _ a source that planned new regulations should clear up, according to several analysts. The newly recognized source is evaporation of gasoline from fuel systems while cars are running. The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> has been assuming these `` running losses'' could be neglected in assessing the formation of ozone, the major component of smog, from volatile compounds like gasoline. New findings suggest the amount of gasoline that evaporates from a car's fuel system when the vehicle is being used on a hot day may be five times to 25 times greater than the amount of unburned gasoline that is permitted to escape in exhaust: 2 grams to 10 grams per mile in `` running losses'' compared with 0.41 grams out the tailpipe. Ten grams of gasoline is about half a liquid ounce. `` If all these things fall into place, it's logical to expect this is a big source and another explanation that could be offered as to why attainment -LRB- of the air quality standards -RRB- has been so hard,'' said <PERSON> Tad </PERSON> <PERSON> Wysor </PERSON>, an engineer in <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s Emissions Control Technology Division in <LOCATION> Ann </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aror </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION> `` Official predictions have been under-predicting'' future improvement, said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON>, a partner in <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, air pollution consultants. All cars must pass tests for gasoline emissions while parked. Newly proposed EPA regulations are designed to reduce this stationary evaporation, along with vapors lost during refueling. They will require refiners to cut summertime gasoline volatility _ its tendency to evaporate _ by 22 percent from the current, often exceeded, voluntary standard. They also will require the existing auto vapor recovery system to be enlarged to capture refueling vapors. Ozone worsens breathing problems. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> last week released the names of 68 urban and rural areas where air did not meet the federal ozone standard in 1987, up from the 62 on the previous year's list. Though <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said a warm summer in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> in 1987 helped push up ozone violations, environmental groups immediately claimed that the data showed that the smog problem was getting worse. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has known for years that today's gasoline volatility _ 11.5 pounds of vapor pressure is the summer standard in much of the country _ will cause cars to flunk its stationary emissions test badly. The fuel used in that test must be 9.0 pounds, the pressure the agency wants to make the mandatory maximum. Nine pounds was typical of gasoline in 1975 when test specifications were drawn up. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON>, director of automotive emissions control for <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s environmental activities staff, said <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> has found that emissions on one part of the stationary test are 16 times greater with 11.5 pound fuel than with 9.0 pound fuel. <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> outlined one explanation for the unexpectedly high running losses at a briefing on vapor recovery systems sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> last week: the near-abandonment of carburetors for fuel injectors by engine manufacturers. Fuel injection systems continuously recycle uninjected fuel back to the tank. Accordig to <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON>, the returning fuel picks up heat in the engine compartment, making fuel in the tank run 20 degrees warmer than the outside air. This heat raises the pressure of the higher-volatility fuel. That appears to overwhelm the existing charcoal cannister in the vapor recovery system, leaving the vapor nowhere to go but to the atmosphere. <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> said he believed the running loss problem was mostly a warm-climate phenomenon affecting `` probably less than 1 percent of miles traveled'' nationwide. But <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, a consultant often used by environmental groups, said, `` One percent sounds like a low number to me.'' `` The ozone problem is a warm-weather problem. ... We have a lot of places in this country with plenty of hot days in the summertime,'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 A juror in the trial of a woman accused of killing her husband and another woman with cyanide-laced medicine received an anonymous telephone call saying the defendant had failed a lie-detector test _ a detail jurors were not allowed to hear, the judge said today. The anonymous caller asked the juror, `` Do n't you all know that she failed the lie detector test?'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Dwyer </PERSON> told attorneys in the case this morning. <PERSON> Dwyer </PERSON> called the incident `` a most regrettable occurrence, and most irresponsible by whoever did it.'' He said he would interview the juror before making a decision on how to proceed. The woman juror wrote him a letter in which she reported receiving the phone call Friday night, <PERSON> Dwyer </PERSON> said. The juror said she did not recognize the caller's voice, and that the caller hung up before she could ask who it was, <PERSON> Dwyer </PERSON> said. The development came as jurors prepared to return to deliberations today after a weekend off. Although they told him Friday they were deadlocked, <PERSON> Dwyer </PERSON> urged them to keep deliberating. The trial began its fourth week today. He also agreed to provide them with addition information they requested on the legal definition of reasonable doubt. Today, <PERSON> Dwyer </PERSON> promised, the court reporter would read backximum sentences of life in prison, while the maximum for tampering is 10 years on each count. Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>'s husband, <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>, 52, and <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Katherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Snow </PERSON>, 40, died in June 1986 after swallowing cyanide-laced Extra-Strength Excedrin capsules. The deaths resulted in a nationwide tampering scare and prompted Excedrin manufacturer Bristol-Meyers to recall all its over-the-counter drug capsules. Prosecutors argued that Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> wanted to end her marriage and financial problems by killing her husband and collecting as much as $ 176,000 in life-insurance benefits, and then tried to cover up the crime by placing more tainted capsules in stores to give the appearance of random tampering. Ms. Snow was an innocent stranger caught in the scheme, the prosecution said.

<DATELINE>COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Danish election campaign drew to a close Monday in a race that could decide the strength of <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>'s commitment to the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> alliance. Conservative Prime Minister <PERSON> Poul </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlueter </PERSON>, in a final appeal before Tuesday's vote, said he sought a mandate to restore <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>'s credibility in the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Schlueter </PERSON> called the election after he failed to block a move in parliament last month to toughen <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>'s anti-nuclear stance. The move was sponsored by the opposition Social Democrats. If implemented, the resolution would require <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> to notify each visiting warship of <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>'s peacetime ban on nuclear weapons in its territory. The resolution was seen as a challenge to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s policy of keeping a nuclear option. Under that policy, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and British ships refuse to say whether they are armed with nuclear weapons. <PERSON> Schlueter </PERSON>, who has led minority governments for six years, called the snap election on the issue just eight months after the last vote. It was <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>'s 19th election since War War II _ a <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> record _ and the first time since then that <LOCATION> Danes </LOCATION> were asked to vote mainly on a foreign policy issue. Twelve parties are contesting the election, three more than are currently represented in the 179-member Folketing, or parliament. <PERSON> Schueter </PERSON>'s four-party alliance of center-right parties controls 70 seats. <PERSON> Schlueter </PERSON> said in an interview published Monday that the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>' motion had undermined <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>'s credibility with its Western allies. `` This is a referendum about <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>,'' he told the conservative newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Berlingske </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tidende </ORGANIZATION>. He also said he expected a long period of post-election haggling to form a workable coalition, and that he hoped for a broad alliance that would command a majority in parliament. He did not rule out a partnership with the Social Democrats, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>'s largest party. `` There is an undeniable need for a group of parties to thoroughly discuss the major political problems,'' he said. `` I would go so far as to say that it is not advisable to appoint a prime minister or a government if there is the least doubt that a new majority is behind them,'' <PERSON> Schlueter </PERSON> said. Pre-election polls indicated another election stand-off is likely between the two major blocs, with the Social-Liberals again holding the balance. The party, with 11 seats, supports the government on domestic policy and the opposition on foreign issues. As many as half a million voters, nearly one in eight, will decide at the last minute how they will vote, said <PERSON> Ole </PERSON> <PERSON> Borre </PERSON>, political science professor at <ORGANIZATION> Aarhus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` Many have n't decided who they will vote for, or whether they will vote at all,'' he told <PERSON> Berlingske </PERSON> <PERSON> Tidende </PERSON>. Turnout last September was 86 percent, about average in <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, where 3.9 million citizens are registered to vote. Polls show the far-right <ORGANIZATION> Progress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, campaigning on a platform of deep tax cuts and limiting immigration, is the only party likely to advance strongly. In the latest poll published Sunday, the <ORGANIZATION> Progress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> took eight percent, compared with the 4.8 percent it won in the previous election. Social Democratic leader <PERSON> Svend </PERSON> <PERSON> Auken </PERSON> has denied that his party is anti-NATO, and has accused <PERSON> Schlueter </PERSON> of exaggerating the meaning of the resolution. <PERSON> Auken </PERSON>, 44, facing the electorate for the first time as party leader, is taking over from former Prime Minister <PERSON> Anker </PERSON> <PERSON> Joergensen </PERSON>, who resigned after the last round of balloting. The Social Democrats campaigned under the slogan `` <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> decides for itself.'' Posters depicting President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> embracing Prime Minister <PERSON> Magaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> implied that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> wanted to dictate <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>'s nuclear policies. The Social Democrats, who dominated Danish politics for 40 years until they relinquished power in 1982, led <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> into <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> as a founding member in 1949. The party drifted toward a hardline anti-nuclear stance shortly after it became the opposition and sponsored a motion to stop <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>'s payments toward the stationing of cruise missiles in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Trade Bill Veto Could Hold Up Action on Arms Pact, Byrd Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A presidential veto of the omnibus trade bill could hold up ratification of the U.S.-Soviet medium-range missile treaty, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said Monday. `` Lots of things could happen'' if the president carries out his threat to veto the 1,000-page bill, <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> told reporters. He stopped short of any specific threat to hold the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces pact hostage to a presidential signature on the trade bill. But he said an effort to override a presidential veto could shoulder aside floor debate on the treaty. The treaty, which was signed last December in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, calls for the elimination of all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet missiles with ranges from about 300 miles to 3,000 miles. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has called on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to ratify the measure by May 29, the opening date of his <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. `` When the president promises that we'll have another trade bill, he has got to remember that a veto would take precedence over the treaty,'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said. Under <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> rules, he said, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> override of a trade bill veto would automatically force senators to take up a similar effort. Thus, debate on an override could be the order of business on the floor on May 29, he said, with the arms pact still pending. `` May 29 is just a date on the calendar,'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said. `` It means absolutely nothing to me or this Senate.'' The trade bill was passed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> two weeks ago. Instead of sending it to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s desk, however, lawmakers retained it on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> while they attempted to make further revisions. The House last week passed a technical corrections resolution that also would drop restrictions on export of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> oil. That measure simply would authorize an official known as the enrolling clerk to dot the i's and cross the t's in the bill _ and erase the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> provisions. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said he hoped to bring up the resolution in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> as soon as possible, but would need the unanimous consent of senators to do so. He said he would discuss that with Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan. It was expected the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> would take up the resolution this week. Major provisions of the trade bill would streamline procedures for use of import restrictions to aid <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industry and to retaliate against international trade violations. Scores of other provisions range from billions of dollars in agricultural subsidies to repeal of the windfall profits tax on oil companies.

 The following is a text of a statement that chief <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> issued today in response to the release of a new book by former White House chief of staff <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>: The new book by <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> is a kiss-and-tell story in the mold of all such books which seek to exploit the presidency or the first family for personal self-interest. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> expressed his view of these kinds of books several days ago, indicating his deep personal disappointment in this breach of confidence. In addition, the president emphasized last week that he had made no policy decisions based on astrology. We also recognize that the first lady has an interest in astrology. After the March 30 -LRB- 1981 -RRB- attempted assassination of the president, she reached out to friends, to ministers, family and her friend who advises on astrology. But we can not comment on her private communications with the chief of staff. Suffice to say we are very proud of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> record, the accomplishments of the administration in the last seven years and the achievements and strengths of the president.

 <LOCATION> Barbra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Streisand </LOCATION> says she has been hearing unusual noise since she was a child and it helped her understand <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Joan </PERSON>, whose character she used for a radio audition when she was 13. `` I knew she was telling the truth'' when she said she heard voices, <PERSON> Streisand </PERSON> said in an interview in the June issue of Ladies Home Journal. `` I do n't hear voices, but I hear noise. All the time,'' the singer said. Streisand evidently hears a wider range of sound on more levels and registers than most people. `` Doctors ca n't do anything about it,'' she said. `` I used to put scarves around my head to muffle the noises, but ... it only made it worse. It's annoying and I've never gotten used to it. Sometimes when I'm under more stress the noises become louder, but if I'm having a good time I sort of forget it momentarily.'' She also talked about her latest beau, <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, star of the `` Miami Vice'' television series. `` When I'm with <PERSON> Don </PERSON>, I can enjoy my celebrity because I do n't have to apologize to the man I'm with for getting all the attention,'' she said `` <PERSON> Don </PERSON> gets as much attention as I do.''

<HEAD>Air Traffic Controller's Error May Have Contributed to Martin
Crash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIVERSIDE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An error by an air traffic controller may have contributed to the 1987 jet crash that killed actor <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, the Riverside Press-Enterprise reported. A controller warning, which incorrectly gave the location of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gorgonio </LOCATION>, may have caused <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> to turn too sharply and lose control of his F-4C Phantom jet, said veteran <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> test pilot <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> LeVier </PERSON>. <PERSON> LeVier </PERSON> made his conclusions after reviewing an analysis by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, according to reports obtained by the newspaper through the Freedom of Information Act. <PERSON> LeVier </PERSON>'s conclusions were published Sunday. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, a captain in the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and son of entertainer <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, and his weapons officer, Capt. <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortiz </PERSON>, 39, died March 21, 1987, when the jet traveling at 600 mph crashed into a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> canyon. The accident report draws no conclusions about what happened during the last seconds of <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>'s flight. <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> pilots and air traffic controllers declined to comment on what might have caused the crash which killed <PERSON> Ortiz </PERSON> and the 35-year-old <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>. But <PERSON> LeVier </PERSON> said it is clear <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> made too sharp a left turn, probably in a moment of panic as he feared hitting the mountain ahead. If you turn the F-4 too quickly, the nose will pull the airplane up, disrupting the plane's aerodynamics, said <PERSON> LeVier </PERSON>, who has tested 70 aircraft during his 46-year career. `` The airplane simply becomes uncontrollable. The ... thing goes ape,'' <PERSON> LeVier </PERSON> said. According to the accident analysis, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> was at 11,500 feet, flying in clouds and had not heard two previous instructions to turn left. His plane was far off its route and heading toward the peak. The controller reportedly told the pilot he was three miles south of a 13,000-foot peak. But the analysis said the peak is 11,502 feet, not 13,000 feet, and <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>'s aircraft was 8 -LCB- miles from the summit, not three miles. Air Guard Maj. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Mensik </PERSON>, spokesman for the Guard in <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, said the controller's erroneous communication with <PERSON> Martin-Ortiz </PERSON> was a contributing factor to the crash. <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> officials at <ORGANIZATION> Ontario </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION> said the controller who handled the <ORGANIZATION> Martin-Ortiz </ORGANIZATION> flight committed no error. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON>, the controller's supervisor, said there were many factors, including the work-load and weather, that might cause the controller to miscalculate the distance of the fighter from the mountain. He said his office has not read the latest accident investigation report. A spokesman for the pilot's family called <PERSON> LeVier </PERSON>'s analysis an assumption. <PERSON> Mort </PERSON> <PERSON> Viner </PERSON> said he had heard other equally plausible causes for the crash.

 Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> will make his fourth trip to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> this year in a fresh attempt to promote Arab-Israeli peace talks, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announced today. `` There are problems there that need to be resolved,'' <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said in announcing that <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> would travel to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> next month. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said <PERSON> Arabs </PERSON> and Israelis had urged <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> to return to the region. But he declined to say whether any of the parties had changed their positions. `` All the people in the region have been very insistent on the fact that the secretary and the administration continue these efforts,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. He said President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had directed <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> to return to the region. There, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> again will promote a <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> peace conference to be followed by negotiations in two stages. The first would be designed to provide some form of self-rule to the 1.5 million Palestinian Arabs who live on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> under Israeli control. The second would deal with an overall Middle East settlement. `` It is the only workable alternative,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> will fly to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> at the windup of the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit meeting June 2 and then attend a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>'s foreign ministers in <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> June 9-10, said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, who spoke only on condition of anonymity. Three trips by <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> this year failed to produce peace talks. But he refuses to give up. `` Who's afraid to struggle against odds?,'' he said at the end of the last venture in April. `` What am I saving myself for, anyway?'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> appropriations subcommittee two weeks ago that `` under the right circumstances'' King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> would be agreeable to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal for a peace conference. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> also testified, however, that <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> had made the conference the `` centerpiece'' of his objections to <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s plan. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> also was unsuccessful last month in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in trying to persuade the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to accept a limited role in the negotiations. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> are opposed to giving the Soviets a chance to shape the outline of a <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> settlement. But <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> is insisting on Soviet involvement. On the other hand, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> is reluctant to negotiate with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> without a guarantee that it would recover all the land it lost during the 1967 Mideast war. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> has advised <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> that was not `` in the cards.'' But he backs the idea of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> trading some territory on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> for peace and said the future of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> should be decided in negotiations. Despite the long odds, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said he did not think his plan was `` fated to failure.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s plan called for a peace conference in mid-April, the opening of negotiations on the Palestinians May 1 and a second stage of talks on an overall settlement beginning Dec. 1. The first two deadlines have passed. But, <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said, `` We need to get this underway as soon as possible.''

<TEXT>
 Civil aeronautics officials today accused <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> of taking a Panamanian plane to a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military base without authorization. `` As far as we are concerned, until we conclude the investigation, that plane was hijacked or stolen,'' Maj. <PERSON> Pascual </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, said at a news conference. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> official said Sunday that the plane carrying <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> flew to an American air base because Panamanian agents harassed his security detail at a commercial airport. The private plane carrying <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> and members of his family landed briefly at the commercial airport, then departed after the confrontation was reported by the security detail awaiting his arrival, the official said. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> did not leave the aircraft while it was at the commercial airport. The embassy official, <PERSON> Terrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Kneebone </PERSON>, did not say precisely what the Panamanian agents did. Long lines formed outside banks early today as people waited to make limited withdrawals from their accounts for the first time in more than nine weeks. Some customers said they had waited for more than two hours before the banks opened this morning. A government order shut down banks March 3 following a run on savings by panicky depositors and the imposition of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic sanctions in an effort to force Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to resign as chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>. Bankers and government officials agreed to reopen after negotiations. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, the power behind the government, was indicted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in February on drug trafficking charges. The general has denied the charges and said they are politically motivated. The sanctions, including the freezing of an estimated $ 50 million of government funds in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> accounts, helped produce a severe cash shortage in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, which uses the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar as its currency. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> and family members were returning from a day trip to the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> island of Contadora when the plane approached <LOCATION> Paitilla </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. As the small jet landed, <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> saw several <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> security agents armed with rifles `` harassing'' his security detail, <PERSON> Kneebone </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> security officials were in contact with the plane by radio as it prepared to land, <PERSON> Kneebone </PERSON> said, and spoke with <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> on the ground. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> decided to fly elsewhere because of the Panamanian agents' `` fairly hostile actions,'' <PERSON> Kneebone </PERSON> said. The plane then requested and received takeoff clearance from the airport tower before flying to <LOCATION> Howard </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION>, five miles northwest in the former <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> zone. One of the Panamanian security agents at <LOCATION> Paitilla </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> demanded to know who was on the plane with <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Kneebone </PERSON>. Maj. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> said the plane also was carrying <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, son-in-law of deposed President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> and son of <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> Galindo </PERSON>, co-founder of an opposition group. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> said the incident started when four armed embassy security men _ all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens _ were seen by airport security on restricted grounds. When they were being questioned, the plane came in, according to <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>. The aircraft taxied to the apron and the embassy security people then talked by radio with those on the plane, the major added. Then the plane took off for <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> said it appeared the passengers were `` afraid'' when they saw the airport security people. He said there `` are procedures that must be followed by all civilian aircraft when landing at a militay base and spending the night.'' Those procedures were not followed, he said. `` The incident could have been avoided if the four embassy security men had first reported to the airport security when they came in,'' <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> said. The owner of the plane, <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Giraud </PERSON>, identified the aircraft as a two-engine six-seater <PERSON> Piper </PERSON> <PERSON> Seneca </PERSON>. <PERSON> Giraud </PERSON> said it had been leased by a pilot, <PERSON> Rigoberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Ng </PERSON>. It was the second incident in which <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> security agents apparently sought to interfere with the ambassador's movements in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. On April 3, a military vehicle unsuccessfully tried to stop <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' chauffer-driven limousine as he was leaving the residence of the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> ambassador.

 <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s U.S.-backed rebels said Monday they killed 64 government soldiers and eight Cubans and also shot down three Soviet-built aircraft in several attacks last week. Rebel casualties were given as 12 killed, 10 wounded and two missing. Also Monday, a press report said <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s foreign minister would meet Thursday with Angolan officials to pursue last week's ground-breaking Angolan peace talks in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> South African soldiers are fighting in support of the 13-year-old rebel movement against <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s Marxist government, which is backed by Soviet advisers and an estimated 40,000 Cuban troops. The rebel group, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> for the Total Independence of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, made Monday's claims in a statement distributed in <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION>. There was no independent confirmation. The rebels said they killed seven Cubans May 2 in an assault on a wood-processing plant near <LOCATION> Conde </LOCATION> in the oil-rich northwestern Angolan enclave of <LOCATION> Cabinda </LOCATION>. They said 64 Angolan soldiers were also killed in actions across six provinces last week. The rebels claimed their anti-aircraft batteries shot down a MiG-21 plane Thursday as it bombed the village of <LOCATION> Kanamba </LOCATION> in southeastern <LOCATION> Moxico </LOCATION> province. They said the Cuban pilot died, and two village children were killed by falling wreckage. The statement also said that two MI-17 helicopters were shot down the previous day in the area. There was no mention of casualties. The guerrillas said violence in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> would `` continue and increase'' until the government, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> agreed to negotiate an end to the civil war. The rebels were not included in the U.S.-brokered talks in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> between delegations from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The South African <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said Foreign Minister <PERSON> Roelof </PERSON> <PERSON> `` </PERSON> <PERSON> Pik </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> would meet with Angolan officials on Thursday to follow up on those talks.

 <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> issued a statement saying <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> might incite Arabs to violence and endanger <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s security. <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> east </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and also has a home in <LOCATION> Wapakoneta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. In the deportation order, the reason for expelling him is given as expiration of his tourist visa. Prosecutor <PERSON> Nili </PERSON> <PERSON> Arad </PERSON> submitted an affadavit Monday, however, that alleges incitement by <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>. It includes testimony by an agent of the Shin Bet security service referred to as `` Yossi'' who says <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> `` posed as a moderate ... but his actions were a serious threat to security and public order.'' He accused <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> of `` taking part in the publication of leaflets which issued ... a call for violent and hostile actions against the state by residents of the territories.'' In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> `` dispatched a message'' to <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> on Monday about the Awad case. Last week, the department objected to deporting him without a hearing. <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>, who advocates non-violent resistance, denies allegations of incitement. Official charges against him fall short of accusations made Friday by <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON>, spokesman for <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>. <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON> accused him of drafting Leaflet No. 15, one of many issued by underground leaders. It urged Palestinians to use violence against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers. Awad, dressed in jeans, a blue-striped shirt and a sport jacket, looked fit despite a hunger strike he is said to have begun after his arrest. He smiled and blew kisses to supporters, who packed the courtroom. `` I feel good,'' he said during a recess. `` I'm still fasting but I started to drink water. I still believe in Israeli law and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> justice and I hope I wo n't be disappointed.'' His wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Nye </PERSON>, told reporters: `` I'd much prefer to have him at home with me and I'm very concerned about him physically. I'm sure he'll continue the hunger strike.'' She said she had not seen her husband privately since Friday and police would not let her talk to him during the recess. `` I was able to touch his cheek,'' she said. Soldiers fired on stone-throwing Palestinians at the Deheishe refugee camp near <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, killing 34-year-old <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Haniyah </PERSON>, the army said. Four other Palestinians were wounded. A leaflet distributed late in April exhorted Palestinians to honor <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> `` martyrs'' Monday. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said the call for a total work and transport strike was observed. Most of the 100,000 Palestinian working in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> stayed home and streets in the occupied lands were deserted. In <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, masked youths threw stones at cars and strike organizers used mosque loudspeakers to declare: `` Every worker who goes to work will be punished.'' Soldiers arrested three women from the Shati refugee camp near <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> and ordered them held for six months, said <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON> <PERSON> Kidra </PERSON>, their lawyer. He said they were members of a camp women's committee and identified one as <PERSON> Widad </PERSON> <PERSON> Saleh </PERSON>, 35 and mother of seven children.

 The Israeli army does not have enough shells for its tanks and artillery, which could affect its readiness for war, the government comptroller's office declared in a report issued Monday.

Comptroller <PERSON> Yaacov </PERSON> <PERSON> Maltz </PERSON> presented the 983-page report at a news conference. About one-fifth of it was devoted to the military. It said management problems have eroded the profitability of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s large weapons industry, and investigators could not determine exactly what use was made of $ 1.8 billion in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid in 1986 because it was lumped with other foreign-currency expenditures. <PERSON> Maltz </PERSON>'s report did not suggest the money was misspent but said records of how it was used were inadequate. `` Some of the budget in foreign currency is allocated along with <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> assistance funds, without any differentiation to monitor what is being purchased with what money,'' it said. The comptroller said the investigations, conducted last year, found shortages of essential weapons. He blamed them on cuts in the defense budget, red tape and a need to divert funds to other projects he did not name. His report said surveys found inadequate supplies of 105mm tank shells, 155mm and 175mm artillery shells and mortars. In keeping with army regulations, no figures were given. <PERSON> Maltz </PERSON> said a more detailed report was delivered to the military. <PERSON> Eitan </PERSON> <PERSON> Haber </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said the army is prohibited by law from responding publicly to such reports. Other parts of the <PERSON> Maltz </PERSON> document said training courses for soldiers were inadequate and lists of ammunition storage depots were outdated, raising questions about public safety. It cited shortages of emergency medical supplies, food, water and shelters in northern settlements bordering <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. A section on the weapons industry criticized one of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s leading arms developers, <ORGANIZATION> Rafael </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armament </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>, for losing money in major arms deals Most losses are covered by the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. It mentioned a $ 35 million deal by <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> in which the military was expected to absorb a $ 3.3 million loss. Instead, projected losses had reached $ 11.7 million and could total nearly $ 15 million, according to the report. Because of censorship regulations it gave no further details of the 1966 contract, but said `` the economic viability of the project was not adequately checked.'' Elsewhere in his report, <PERSON> Maltz </PERSON> was critical of the public health system, which has been disrupted by strikes and other job actions by doctors, nurses and maintenance staff. The report said more than 30,000 Israelis had to wait up to three years for operations as a result.

<TEXT>
 Western <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> welcomed the re-election of <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> as president of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, and political leaders of all persuasions sent their congratulations Monday. Commentators foresaw uncertainty for <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> with a <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> president and rightist-dominated <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, but that was the case before the election. They complimented <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> for running a shrewd campaign and criticized the tactics of his conservative opponent, Premier <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>. Congratulations from around the world cut across ideological lines. Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> looked forward to continued cooperation between the two governments. His conservative <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Democrats </PERSON> said in a statement: `` The proven Europe-oriented tandem of <LOCATION> Kohl-Mitterrand </LOCATION> will be able to continue its successful work in the future.'' <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>'s Socialist chancellor, <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Vranitzky </PERSON>, expressed satisfaction that <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> failed and praised <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>'s `` moderate and statesmanlike policies.'' Another socialist, Prime Minister <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, said those policies would strengthen his country's relations with <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. Some conservative newspapers welcomed the re-election despite their idealogical opposition to <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>. `` If not more than two cheers are in order for Mr. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>'s triumph, it is hard to weep many tears of chagrin over Mr. <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>'s defeat,'' said <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> It accused <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> of `` grotesque attempts'' to win votes: gaining the release of French hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> after `` scarcely glorious negotiations with their captors,'' ordering a bloody attack on New Caledonian separatists and allowing a <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> secret service agent convicted in the bombing of a <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> environmentalist ship to return home despite an exile agreement. The left-leaning Guardian said <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>'s victory `` is not only deserved but also in his country's best interests as well as a relief for <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s Western allies.'' It said of <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>: `` The nakedness of the loser's ambition and his readiness to mortgage French interests at home and abroad in the pursuit of personal power finally outweighed his undisputed talents and phenomenal energy.'' <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Pais </PERSON>, a Spanish center-left daily, said said <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> `` dared to put at risk traditional values and interests to win votes. It is the opposite of what a responsible statesman must do.'' <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s main Social Democratic paper, Aftenbladet, said the result placed <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>'s future in doubt and seriously diminished the legacy of <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaulle </PERSON>. `` One thing is certain,'' it said in an editorial. `` Most of the Gaullism that has so long dominated the picture is now eliminated.'' A conservative Belgian paper, <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Libre </PERSON> <PERSON> Belgique </PERSON>, said: `` The <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> did not let themselves be impressed by the increased spectacles put on in recent days by a <ORGANIZATION> Jacques </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chirac </ORGANIZATION> visibly on the ropes and for whom defeat is all the more scalding.'' In opposition to <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, said <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>'s independent <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Matin </PERSON>, `` there was nothing but unrest, divisions, sectarianism and demagogy.'' In the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbatchev </PERSON> hailed <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>'s success and expressed a wish for `` our personal contacts to play their positive role in promoting disarmament, building the common European house, settling regional conflicts, building trust, and improving the international climate on the whole.''

 Unidentified men in a van fired at troops guarding a television transmitter late today, wounding at least one soldier, the military said.

Arch <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> face tough Republican primary fights Tuesday, while <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> is heavily favored to win <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s Democratic nomination to a sixth term <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON>, 39, was a political unknown when he was appointed last year by Gov. <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> to complete the term of the late Democratic Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Zorinsky </PERSON>. He is being aggressively challenged by four-term Rep. <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Daub </PERSON>, who wanted the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> appointment for himself. <PERSON> Daub </PERSON>, 47, has accused <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON> of being a `` rubber stamp'' for <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and said he had `` flip-flopped'' on many votes to please the president, including the trade bill and last year's highway bill that raised the speed limit to 65 mph <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON> has said he will not answer such name-calling, but Mrs. <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> said last week it was `` sad'' that <PERSON> Daub </PERSON> `` feels he has to take a desperate approach.'' An <ORGANIZATION> Omaha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World-Herald </ORGANIZATION> poll last week showed <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON> backed by 41 percent of those interviewed, while <PERSON> Daub </PERSON> was supported by 40 percent. Nineteen percent were undecided, and the margin of error was 4 percentage points. Whoever wins the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> primary is expected to face 44-year-old former Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerrey </PERSON>, whose only opponent in the Democratic primary is <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Michaelis </PERSON>, a 45-year-old disbarred lawyer. In <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>'s 2nd Congressional District, where <PERSON> Daub </PERSON> is giving up his seat, four Democrats are seeking the nomination, including <PERSON> Cece </PERSON> <PERSON> Zorinsky </PERSON>, widow of the senator. In <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> is seeking a fourth term as he battles <LOCATION> Morgantown </LOCATION> millionaire <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Raese </PERSON> in the Republican race for governor. On the Democratic side, seven candidates are vying for the nomination. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, 65, trailed in early polls but has surged ahead, pushing the theme that his state is making an economic recovery. He takes credit for cutting taxes by $ 311 million in the past four years, although he fought most of the cuts when they were imposed by the Legislature. He also cites his accomplishments at bringing news businesses and bringing 30,000 jobs to the state, although the total number of employed West Virginians has increased by just 5,700 since <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> took office in 1985. <PERSON> Raese </PERSON>, 38, maintains the state is in perilous financial shape and said <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> made just 10 percent of $ 385 million in budget cuts recommended by the Governor's Task Force on Waste Management. <PERSON> Raese </PERSON>, who has a reputation as a `` rich kid'' who loves fast boats and hard living, lost to another millionaire, <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockefeller </PERSON>, in his first try for office in the 1986 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> race. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> was the subject of an <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> report Sunday in which former <LOCATION> Mingo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> political boss <PERSON> Johnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> said <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> offered him $ 12,000 to include his name on a list of recommended candidates when <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> was running for re-election in 1972.

<HEAD>Iraq Building New Oil Pipeline to Boost Strategic Position</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED BLANCHE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> is building a new pipeline that will allow it to pump oil through either <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, The Middle East Economic Survey reported Monday. The pipeline is expected to be completed by 1990 and would increase <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s ability to maintain exports vital to <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>'s war effort against <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The respected weekly oil industry newsletter, published in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, said the 400-mile, 42-inch line will parallel an existing north-south pipeline running the length of the country. It will hook into a network linking Iraqi oilfields with outlets across <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> in the south and <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> in the north, the weekly said. The project will secure <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s ability to pump its oil safely out of the war zone. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, its foe in the 7 -LCB- - year-old war, has to send its tankers to run the gantlet of Iraqi fighter-bombers through the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> The pipeline also would remove the threat to the industrialized world if <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> closed the <ORGANIZATION> Strait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hormuz </ORGANIZATION>, the only way in and out of the gulf. The Iraqis already have three pipelines linking their southern oilfields with <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>'s Red Sea terminal of <LOCATION> Yanbu </LOCATION> and their northern oilfields with the Turkish port of <LOCATION> Yumurtalik </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>. They carry an estimated 2.5 million barrels of oil a day. About 200,000 barrels a day are trucked across <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. The new pipeline will have a capacity of 900,000 barrels a day, the survey said. The Iraqis began building their pipeline network several years ago after the war cut them off from their main export terminals in the northern gulf and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> closed a pipeline to the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> that crossed its territory. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s main Arab ally, has been feuding with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> for eight years. The two countries are ruled by rival wings of the <ORGANIZATION> Baath </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. In the early days of the war, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s oil exports plummetted to about 650,000 barrels a day. Now, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> is developing new oilfields in southern and central <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> which industry experts say could boost production to around 5 million barrels a day by the end of the next decade. The drive to boost exports is vital to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. The war, which costs it at least $ 10 billion a year, has increased its foreign debt to an estimated $ 50 billion. By next year, providing oil price remain stable, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> could expect to earn $ 15 billion from crude exports. In contrast, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has pegged its anticipated oil revenue, on which it also relies to pay for its war effort, at only $ 9 billion. The Iraqi air force has been pounding <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s oil industry and tankers in a bid to throttle <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s economic lifeline. The war and the threat to shipping have touched off a frenzy of pipeline building and planning by <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> states. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> is upgrading its network, and <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Dahbi </PERSON> are studying new pipelines. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> is racing to build pipelines to its Arabia Sea coast to avoid the dangerous gulf route. The Oslo-based <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tanker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Owners </ORGANIZATION> said in a recent report that pipelines now under construction will cut demand for supertankers by 46 cargoes a year between the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.

 Motorists nationwide are paying an average of $ 1 a gallon for gasoline, an increase of more than a penny a gallon over the past two weeks, an industry analyst said. The increase of 1.41 cents a gallon was a `` dramatically slowed rate compared to the rises surveyed during April,'' <PERSON> Trilby </PERSON> <PERSON> Lundberg </PERSON> said Sunday. The average price of gasoline was 100.25 cents a gallon, according to the bi-weekly <ORGANIZATION> Lundberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Survey </ORGANIZATION> check of prices at about 12,000 gas stations in every state. The latest survey was completed Saturday. The previous survey showed an increase of 2.67 cents a gallon in the average price, which includes all grades, self - and full-serve pumps, cash and credit prices and taxes As of May 6, at self-service pumps prices per gallon were: regular unleaded, 91.46 cents; premium unleaded, 105.86 cents; regular leaded, 88.56 cents. At full-service pumps prices were: regular unleaded, 119.56 cents; premium unleaded, 129.50 cents; regular leaded, 115.29 cents. The Lundberg Survey inadvertently reported a preliminary rather than a final set of numbers on Sunday, Ms. <PERSON> Lundberg </PERSON> said.

<DATELINE>ROCKFORD, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Eight months after <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Small </PERSON> was found dead before a $ 1 million ransom could be paid, the case is headed for court. Jury selection begins Tuesday for <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, 31, one of two people charged with kidnapping and murder. The jury will be selected in <LOCATION> Rockford </LOCATION>, then taken to <LOCATION> Kankakee </LOCATION> and sequestered during the trial, expected to last up to three weeks, said prosecutor <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Ficaro </PERSON>. <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rish </PERSON>, 26, both of <PERSON> Bourbonnais </PERSON>, were arrested two days after the abduction and hours before police found Small's body Sept. 4 in woods between the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> border and <LOCATION> Kankakee </LOCATION>, a city of 30,000 approximately 60 miles south of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. No trial date has been set for Ms. <PERSON> Rish </PERSON>, who lived with <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>. Small, 40, was kidnapped early Sept. 2, and a $ 1 million ransom was demanded in telephone calls to his wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>. The family never received clear instructions for the cash delivery. Small, the great-grandson of former Gov. <PERSON> Len </PERSON> <PERSON> Small </PERSON> and member of a family with major media holdings, apparently had been buried alive in about three feet of sand in a homemade box supplied with a jug of water, candy bars and an unconnected battery-powered light. Air supplied through slits in the plywood by a plastic pipe apparently `` was just not sufficient,'' said <LOCATION> Kankakee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Coroner <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Orrison </PERSON>, who indicated Small died quickly. The <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> attorney general's office has indicated it will seek the death penalty for <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>. Police said Small was lured from his restored Victorian home by a telephone call from a person identifying himself as a policeman and asking him to come to a house he used as an office because it had been burglarized. Before dawn, Mrs. <PERSON> Small </PERSON> received a call saying her husband would be found in a box if the ransom was not paid. The call included a tape-recorded message from Small saying he had been kidnapped. Late in the day, a call with instructions for delivering the $ 1 million was unclear. The person promised to call back the next day, but the Small family received no other calls. Police searching the area spotted the Smalls' 1987 <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes-Benz </ORGANIZATION> on Sept. 4 about 13 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Kankakee </LOCATION> and soon discovered the buried box containing the body. At a court hearing Sept. 8, <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Beaumont </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Assistant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kankakee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>'s Attorney, said <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> had made `` statements and confessions'' and led police to Small's body. <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, who described himself as an unemployed electrician and the father of two, slashed his wrist in the <LOCATION> Kankakee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> jail the following day. The wound was closed with eight stitches. Small had been vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Mid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION>, a group that owned radio and cable television stations, but the company was sold in 1986.

 The White House denounced <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> today as exploiting the presidency with his book detailing <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s interest in astrology, but left open the question of whether stargazing still plays a role in presidential scheduling. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said again that he never used astrology to make policy decisions. At a Rose Garden ceremony honoring small business executives, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was asked whether he permits the consultation of astrologists in connection with schedules and public appearances. `` Well, you asked for it,'' he replied. `` I ca n't because I never did.'' Moments later, however, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s chief spokesman, <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, said the president had misunderstood the question shouted by a reporter from the rear of the Rose Garden. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> thought he was being asked whether astrology was being used to make key policy decisions, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. So <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was in effect merely reiterating a statement he made last Friday, denying that stargazing played a role in policy decisions, his spokesman said. Earlier, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> left open the question of whether astrology still plays a role in scheduling. For her part, the first lady says she will keep talking to her astrologer, her spokeswoman said. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> feels `` deep personal disapointment with this breach of confidence.'' `` I was taken aback by the vengefulness of the attack. It comes through to me that <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> does n't really like me,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was quoted as saying by her press secretary. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> gave a sharply-worded statement to reporters as the first lengthy White House reaction to the book by the former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> chief of staff entitled, `` For the Record: from Wall Street to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.'' In the book, <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> contended <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` laid down no rules and articulated no missions'' while his wife presided over a `` shadowy distaff presidency'' heavily influenced by astrological advice. `` The new book by <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> is a kiss-and-tell story in the mold of all books that seek to exploit the presidency or the first family for personal self-interest,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` The president emphasized last week that he made no policy decisions based on astrology. We recognize that the first lady has an interest in astrology,'' he added. The spokesman defended the first lady's interest in stargazing, as well as her input into the preparation of the president's schedule `` She has every reason to make contributions on presidential schedules and activities,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` She has every right to continue it,'' he added at another point. Asked repeatedly whether she continued to rely on astrological predictions in such matters, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> replied, `` I do n't know.'' The spokesman also took issue with <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>'s contention that astrology played a major role in decisions about the president's schedule Asked about any factual errors in the book, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> replied there were `` a whole lot of things, but we're simply not going to go into it.'' `` I know the first lady is very upset about anybody trying to exploit her concerns for her husband's safety and welfare,'' he said. <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Crispen </PERSON>, the first lady's press secretary, said today that Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told her she intends to keep talking to the astrologer. The woman has been identified as a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> socialite, <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON>. Asked if the first lady will continue to use astrology in helping plan the president's schedule, Mrs. <PERSON> Crispen </PERSON> said only, `` She will more than likely continue to talk to this person because she does get some comfort from it.'' `` It does n't control their lives ... she does n't see any harm in it,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Crispen </PERSON> added. <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>'s book details his allegations that Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> consulted an astrologer about scheduling of presidential events. The book pictures <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as a reluctant decision-maker, saying, `` Never did he issue a direct order, although I, at least, sometimes devoutly wished that he would.'' `` He listened, acquiesced, played his role, and waited for the next act to be written,'' <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> wrote of the president who dumped him in favor of former Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> at the height of the furor over the Iran-Contra affair. Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was widely reported at the time to have a played a major role in influencing the president to replace <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>. The White House issued a statement Sunday saying: `` Vindictiveness and revenge are not admirable qualities, and are not worthy of comment. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>'s attempts to defame the first lady, on Mother's Day no less, are certainly in that category.'' In an interview Sunday, <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> said, `` I do n't think this is an attack on his wife. ... There are no adjectives, no deprecation of the first lady. I merely told the story of what she did or did n't do during my period as chief of staff. The former chief of staff said he regarded Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s interest in astrology as a harmless eccentricity at first and `` it was n't until it began to impinge and in my judgment harm the presidency in the latter part of 1986 and early 1987 that I began to protest. <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> said he was donating all of his proceeds from the book, published by <PERSON> Harcourt </PERSON> <PERSON> Brace </PERSON> <PERSON> Jovanovich </PERSON>, to charity. In his book, the former chief of staff wrote `` my admiration for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as president remains very great'' although `` my judgment of him as a man, in light of my final experience as his chief of staff, underwent a certain change.'' Over and over, however, he described the president as a leader who holds the reins lightly. `` <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> believed that the president could conduct his office in any way that was not specifically prohibited by the Constitution,'' he wrote. `` <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who laid down no rules and articulated no missions, conferred a Rooseveltian latitude on his subordinates.'' <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>, who was secretary of the treasury before moving to the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, said that in his four years at the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, `` I never saw President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> alone and never discussed economic philosophy or fiscal and monetary policy with him man to man. `` From first day to last at <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>, I was flying by the seat of my pants. The president never told me what he believed or what he wanted to accomplish in the field of economics. I had to figure these things out like any other American, by studying his speeches and reading the newspapers.'' As for the first lady, he said, `` Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> regarded herself as the president's alter ego not only in the conjugal but also in the political and official dimensions, as if the office that had been bestowed upon her husband by the people somehow fell into the category of worldly goods covered by the marriage vows.'' He said of <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON>, who served as deputy chief of staff before <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> came to the White House, that `` his function in the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> had as much to do with the mysterious process of managing this shadowy distaff presidency as with his visible role as the custodian of the presidential image.'' <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> says that `` virtually every major move and decision the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> made during my time as White House chief of staff was cleared in advance with a woman in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> who drew up horoscopes to make certain that the planets were in a favorable alignment for the enterprise.' He said he did not know the woman's identity. However, <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION>, which published excerpts from the book, identified her as <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON> confirmed in a telephone interview that she had been giving Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> astrological advice since shortly after the assassination attempt on the president in 1981.

 The <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> home where band leader <PERSON> Woody </PERSON> <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> was nearly evicted shortly before his death must be sold and half the proceeds given to his daughter, a judge ruled. <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> bought the home from <LOCATION> Humphrey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bogart </LOCATION> in 1946 for $ 50,000. He and his wife gave it to their daughter, <PERSON> Ingrid </PERSON> <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Reese </PERSON>, in 1982.

<HEAD>Treasury Urges Caution On Tougher Taxes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> urged <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> Monday to proceed cautiously on proposals that would toughen the tax on some activities of colleges, hospitals and other organizations which generally are exempt from taxation. Such changes could force universities, for example, to pay tax on income earned from their cafeterias, or tax hospitals on profits from their pharmacies. `` It would be premature to make far-reaching changes to the law at this time,'' <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapoton </PERSON>, assistant secretary of the treasury for tax policy, told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> oversight subcommittee. If numerous proposals being weighed are ever formalized into a bill, he added, `` it will be important to assess the over-all impact of such legislation on tax-exempt organizations in order to determine whether the benefits of the legislation justify the imposition of such burdens.'' Several members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> favor strengthening the special tax on non-profit organizations' income that is not related to the purpose for which their tax exemption was granted. The levy is known as the `` unrelated-business-income tax.'' The tax was enacted in 1950 to protect taxable enterprises that find themselves competing with exempt organizations. The tax produced $ 119 million last year _ almost double the 1986 figure _ from 30,500 organizations. There is some evidence, officials said, that this increase was attributable to subcommittee hearings last year, which were widely followed by non-profit groups. The increased collections, said Rep. <PERSON> J.J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickle </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, the committee chairman, were `` a result of either better compliance by tax-exempt organizations or a dramatic growth in income-producing activities subject to the tax or both.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> estimates that if all the toughest proposals being considered were enacted, the maximum yield would be no more than $ 5 billion a year. <PERSON> Chapoton </PERSON> noted, however, that the tax does more than produce revenue and protect taxable competitors. The tax `` also serves the important goals of enhancing the efficiency of the governmental subsidy inherent in tax exemption and of helping to ensure the accountability of tax-exempt organizations.'' Although <PERSON> Chapoton </PERSON> endorsed some of the several suggestions the subcommittee drafted last year for tightening the tax, he rejected two major changes. Present law exempts from tax a non-profit organization's income generated by a business that is `` substantially related'' to the organization's exempt purpose. The proposal would exempt income only if `` directly related.'' That would generate considerable uncertainty without improving the standard, <PERSON> Chapoton </PERSON> said. He also said the administration opposes a suggestion that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> declare what specific income-producing activities standing alone by themselves should be tax-exempt. Under that test, <PERSON> Chapoton </PERSON> said, operations of dormitories, dining halls and hospital pharmacies likely would be taxable. A long line of witnesses gave the subcommittee advice on all sides of the issue. _ <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>: `` Due to recent changes in federal tax and spending policies, rising costs at non-profit arts institutions and stagnant federal funding, this is no time to make any further changes in policies that have stimulated the growth of the arts in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. _ <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION>: `` Some institutional bookstores pay more in taxes than many small businesses This suggests that ... -LRB- the present tax -RRB- is working.'' _ Small Business Administration: Present law has `` allowed non-profits to earn non-taxable income from activities never contemplated by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in carving out their original exemption The distinction between the two sectors has become blurred _ in some instances, beyond recognition.'' _ Independent Sector, representing numerous charities and other non-profit organizations: Several proposals being considered by the subcommittee `` would result in changes going far beyond corrected perceived abuses and anomalies to radically altering the way the tax system affects the viability of charities in this country.

 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> knew of allegations of drug trafficking by the government of Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> well before the Panamanian's indictment earlier this year, but viewed the information as speculative, a campaign official said Monday. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Teeley </PERSON>, spokesman for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s Republican presidential campaign, said <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> was just one of a number of countries about which there were such reports. He repeated <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s central contention that he did not have clear evidence of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s alleged drug dealing until <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s indictment in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> in February. The question of exactly when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> learned of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s alleged role in drug-dealing has become a major issue in the presidential race. It was raised in the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> primaries before <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> locked up the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination and now is being pressed by Democrats <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has consistently maintained he had no direct knowledge of a <LOCATION> Noriega </LOCATION> role in drug trafficking _ just as he has said he lacked early knowledge in the other case that follows him as he campaigns, the Iran-Contra arms-for-hostages affair. Democratic front-runner <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> frequently criticizes what he calls `` dealing with drug-running Panamanian dictators'' by the Reagan-Bush administration. And <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> asserts, `` The reason Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has not led the charge to fight drugs is because he knew of the administration's dealings with the drug dealers.'' Critics have asserted that, either <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> knew more than he is saying on the subject or, if he did n't, he should have as head of the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, a federal drug-inderdiction effort, in the early 1980s. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, a former director of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, has made the war on drugs a major campaign issue, challenging both <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> to stand with him in supporting the death penalty for `` drug kingpins.'' <PERSON> Teeley </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s assertion that he had no prior knowledge of specific <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> drug dealings does not suggest <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was completely in the dark. `` I think anybody who knows anything about what's gone on in the world of international narcotics trafficking is fully aware that there are all sorts of rumors and reports about foreign officials being involved in drug trafficking, money laundering and payoffs. Some turn out to be accurate, some are not,'' <PERSON> Teeley </PERSON> said. `` We heard all sorts of accusations about the government in the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>,'' he added. `` But the question is, when do you get concrete evidence that soemthing of this nature is indeed true?'' The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, quoting unidentified administration officials, said in Sunday editions that the former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Briggs </PERSON>, told <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> during a December 1985 meeting about the allegations. However, <PERSON> Briggs </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> Hondurus </LOCATION>, his present post, that he had not presented <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> with evidence of a Noriega-drugs link. `` I think that the ambassador's comments speak for themselves,'' <PERSON> Teeley </PERSON> said Monday. Asked during a campaign stop in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> last Thursday whether he ever had been told of reports of ties between <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and drug trafficking, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` Not that I was ever aware of.'' He also said that, even now, he does not know much `` about the specifics of the indictment.'' Asked if he would advocate the death penalty for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> if he is tried and convicted, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said: `` I'd like to see the evidence behind the allegations. Meanwhile, administration and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will formally endorse <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Wednesday, most likely in a White House ceremony in advance of a Wednesday <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> banquet that both the president and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will attend.

His reference to the heavy burden born by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> comes at a time when a growing number of congressional leaders are demanding that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s allies in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> along with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> contribute more to the common defense. <PERSON> Carrington </PERSON> said he hoped the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> bore the burden `` because you believe it's in the interest of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as well as in the interests of your allies _ because self-interest is more lasting a basis than general goodwill.''

<DATELINE>HAIFA, Israel (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A West German cadet ship sailed into this <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> port Monday in the first visit by a German military unit to the Jewish state. The West German ambassador cited the port call as an example of solid bilateral relations. Some Israelis, however, said they felt uneasy at the sight of German military men strolling through <LOCATION> Haifa </LOCATION>'s streets. `` They are young people and I have nothing against them,'' said <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Biermann </PERSON>, 54, a bank clerk who lived through World War II as a boy in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>. `` But when I see a German uniform, I still feel a stab in my heart,'' he added as seven cadets wearing traditional white-and-blue sailor suits passed him on <LOCATION> Haifa </LOCATION>'s bustling main street. The three-mast sailing ship <PERSON> Gorch </PERSON> <PERSON> Fock </PERSON> is in <LOCATION> Haifa </LOCATION> for a five-day stay that will include a soccer match between German and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> cadets, visits to <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> families and a trip to the Holocaust memorial Yad Vashem in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. The port call in <LOCATION> Haifa </LOCATION> is part of an 11-month sail around the world for the Gorch Forck before it returns to its homeport, <LOCATION> Kiel </LOCATION>, in June. Stops have included <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. West German Ambassador <PERSON> Wilhelm </PERSON> <PERSON> Haas </PERSON> described the relationship between the defense establishments of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> as good, and said `` the visit of the ship fits very well into this picture.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is selling ammunition, aircraft and remote-control vehicles to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> visited <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> last year. Asked about the feelings of unease expressed by some Israelis, <PERSON> Haas </PERSON> said: `` German officers come here, as <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officers come to <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. They do n't hide their uniforms. Why should they.'' But some cadets said they were apprehensive before coming to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` It's a mixed feeling,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Fromm </PERSON>, 21, of <LOCATION> Duesseldorf </LOCATION>. `` We do n't know what the reaction is going to be. We were advised that if there was a problem, we should remain calm.'' Added <PERSON> Uwe </PERSON> <PERSON> Kroll </PERSON>, 23, of <LOCATION> Bremerhaven </LOCATION>: `` We are not here for our amusement, like in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, where we had one party after another. Here especially, you feel like a representative of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>.'' As the cadets strolled through the steep streets to buy film and souvenirs, some passers-by stopped and turned when they heard the young sailors speaking German. `` Who are they, Germans?'' one passer-by asked this reporter. `` You should n't be talking to them after what they have done to our people.'' During a beer break at a downtown cafe, the cadets said that before their arrival, they were briefed about <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, especially the Holocaust in which six million Jews were killed by <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` We were told that nearly every family in <LOCATION> Haifa </LOCATION> was affected by the Holocaust,'' said <PERSON> Kroll </PERSON>, whose grandfather served in <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s navy He said he would like to meet an Israeli family, but that he had to stand guard at the time such visits are scheduled. `` We talked about the Holocaust, about the guilt of the <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> people,'' said <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Schinkel </PERSON>, a West German navy spokesman who briefed the cadets. `` We did n't prettify anything.'' An <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> navy vessel was docked next to the <PERSON> Gorch </PERSON> <PERSON> Fock </PERSON>, and an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> reserve soldier, who would only identify himself as <PERSON> Rafi </PERSON>, walked over to take a closer look at the 90-meter-long white barque equipped with 23 sails. `` It's beautiful,'' he said. `` I do n't care if it's from <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, or <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION> or any other place.'' Added another <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier: `` Time has passed. We are buying their cars and their machines. But we will never forget.''

 Two units of a coal-powered electric plant were knocked out of service Monday when a spectacular fire roared through one unit, but no serious injuries were reported, a company spokesman said. `` Unit 2 suffered minor damage and should be back in operation in about a week, but Unit 1 sustained major damage,'' said <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Fela </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Seminole </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperative </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fela </PERSON> said Monday it was too early to estimate the damage. The fire erupted early Monday in the seal oil system in the turbine generator.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said Monday that each year of his administration has seen `` unparalleled growth'' of small business and that the climate has never been better for entrepeneurs. `` The record, quite simply, is incredible,'' he said at a Rose Garden ceremony honoring small business. `` Small business provides well over two-thirds of all new jobs; about 40 percent of our aggregate national output; the bulk of new products and technologies; most of the jobs generated for younger, older and female workers; and over 66 percent of all ` first jobs.''' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said the past five years have seen the longest unbroken period of peacetime growth on record. `` The climate necessary to nurture small business development has never been better,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` Clearly the econopmic policies of the 1980s ... have made it immensely easier to start up a small business and keep it going.'' The ceremony coincided with the administration's seventh report to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on the state of small business. `` Small business news continues to be good news,'' the report said. `` The continuation of this strong small business record is a national priority.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> presented plaques as `` Business Persons of the year'' to boyhood friends <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenfield </PERSON>, who started <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Homemade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vt. </LOCATION>, and made it the third largest distributor in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> `` Beginning with two employees in 1978, the company now employs 200, and the $ 8,000 in start-up money now generates annual sales of $ 30 million selling to grocery stores in 35 states and in 45 ice cream parlors around the country,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. The president also told the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> guests that `` small business is about hopes and dreams,'' making dreams come true. `` Those dreams, those hopes,'' he said, `` are a singular and great natural resource.''

<HEAD>Premier Prepares to Resign as Mitterrand Ponders New Government</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Conservative Premier <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> on Monday prepared to resign and hand over power to a new Socialist-led government a day after he was trounced in an election by President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>. Meanwhile, the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> stock market responded positively to the Socialist incumbent's victory. While aides packed files and personal items in cardboard boxes and plastic sacks, <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> made an appointment to hand his resignation letter to <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> on Tuesday, his spokesman said. The move clears the way for appointment of a new premier. Officials at presidential Elysee Palace made no comment, but <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> was widely expected to name <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>'s successor within a day or two. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, 71, swept away his 55-year-old premier in Sunday's voting, winning re-election to a second seven-year term and ending two years of uncomfortable `` cohabitation'' between the political opponents Final results announced Monday afternoon gave <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> 16,710,723 votes or 54 percent, to 14,221,682 or 46 percent for <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON>, a 57-year-old former agriculture minister, was billed as the most likely choice to lead the new government. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> has said he wants non-Socialists included in the Cabinet. <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> has been known for his openness to the political center, a characteristic that has helped make him suspect among some officials in his own <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Other possible premiers include two former finance ministers, <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Delors </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Beregovoy </PERSON>; and <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>'s chief of staff, <PERSON> Jean-Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Bianco </PERSON>. But political commentators said the wily president could well surprise everyone with an unexpected choice. The Socialists control only 211 seats in the 577-member <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, so the life of the new government could be difficult _ or short. Te new premier could try to negotiate a coalition with centrist members of parliament but will probably try to survive at least several months by avoiding controversial issues apt to lead to a legislative defeat. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> could also dissolve the body and call new elections, but he has vowed to do so only if his first government loses a parliamentary vote of confidence and falls. The Union for French Democracy, the center-right coalition body that was aligned with <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>'s Rally for the Republic for the past two years, said in a statement that it would judge the new premier's proposals one by one and not automatically vote to censure his government. Meanwhile, the extreme-right <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> claimed it was the new leader of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s right. It issued a statement saying its head, <PERSON> Jean-Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON>, `` has become at this hour the de facto leader of the national and popular opposition to organize the <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> of <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> people against socialism.'' The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>'s position was greatly strengthened by <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON>'s surprising 14 percent of the vote in the first round of presidential elections April 24, when <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> drew just 20 percent and <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> captured 34 percent. Meanwhile, the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> stock exchange reacted calmly and favorably Monday to the election news. The general market indicator showed a gain of 0.9 percent at the end of the afternoon session, after a 2 percent jump earlier. Advances led declines by 118 to 65, with 23 issues unchanged. The market responded very differently seven years ago after <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>'s surprise first victory. Investors sold madly, frightened by <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>'s radical rhetoric and pledges to include Communists in the government. Analysts said <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>'s victory was widely anticipated this time. Morever, <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> has been moving toward the political center in the past few years, and it appeared the new government would not make major changes in economic policy. One of the few significant programs <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> has said he intends to pursue is re-establishment of the Socialist wealth tax, abolished by <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> in 1986. The proceeds would fund a minimum guaranteed income.

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> on Monday blamed one of his party's worst state election losses in years on bickering within his coalition government and backlash from a political dirty tricks campaign. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s comments came after leaders of his conservative <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> party gathered to assess the damage done in Sunday's elections in the northern state of <LOCATION> Schleswig-Holstein </LOCATION> The chancellor's party was ousted from power in the state for the first time in 38 years, losing nearly 10 percent of the vote. But the election was a decisive victory for the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, who won 54.8 percent of the vote after they had lost ground in a string of state elections over the past 18 months, according to the unofficial figures. The results were the best-ever posted by the Social Democrats in <LOCATION> Schleswig-Holstein </LOCATION>, giving the party 46 of the 74 seats in the state's parliament, an increase of 10 seats from the previous election. Unofficial results showed the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> won 33.3 percent of the vote and 27 seats, down from 33 seats. Sunday's vote was called to break the stalemate in the state's government that followed an inconclusive election in September 1987 In that contest, the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> polled 42.6 percent of the vote, while the Social Democrats got 45.2 percent. `` The clashes that occurred from time to time certainly did not help us,'' said <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, speaking of the in-fighting within his three-party federal coalition in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>. The chancellor also told reporters that a principal cause of the unexpectedly large loss was `` the deep shock that lingered'' from the <PERSON> Barschel </PERSON> affair, one of the biggest domestic scandals to hit <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in recent years. <PERSON> Uwe </PERSON> <PERSON> Barschel </PERSON> served as the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> governor in <LOCATION> Schleswig-Holstein </LOCATION> until he resigned last fall after news of a political dirty tricks campaign surfaced in the West German media. <PERSON> Barschel </PERSON> was found dead in a <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> hotel room in October, and authorities ruled his death an apparent suicide. Meanwhile, the youth wing of <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> called on the chancellor to reshuffle his Cabinet as a means of offsetting the <LOCATION> Schleswig-Holstein </LOCATION> election loss. `` A freshening-up of the coalition with younger people is urgently called for,'' <PERSON> Christoph </PERSON> <PERSON> Boehr </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, was quoted by the <ORGANIZATION> Bild </ORGANIZATION> newspaper as saying. After meeting with <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> leaders, <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> acknowledged to reporters that his party had suffered a `` serious loss'' in the state elections. But the chancellor said he was convinced the coalition would continue to be popular and predicted it would be re-elected in the 1990 federal elections. Finance Minister <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Schleswig-Holstein </LOCATION>, said at the same news conference that he had no intention of resigning his party position because of the election debacle. The liberal Free Democratic party _ the junior party in <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s governing coalition _ also posted losses, falling from 5.2 percent of the vote in September to 4.4 percent Sunday The loss was decisive, because the <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> failed to win the minimum 5 percent of the vote. Under West German law, a party must win at least 5 percent of the vote to take any parliamentary seats. As a result, the Free Democrats lost all four of their places in the parliament. The environmental <ORGANIZATION> Greens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION> also failed to win parliamentary seats after receiving only 2.9 percent of the vote _ well below the 3.9 percent it won in September.

 A weekend fire at an <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> switching station kept telephones idle for 35,000 customers in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s western suburbs Monday and caused delays at major airports No remedies were expected until at least midweek, <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> officials said. Crews at the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s control center in <LOCATION> Aurora </LOCATION> were using a backup phone system, but the lack of full service meant controllers had to stagger the arrival of flights by 20 miles. `` Major trouble, major,'' said <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mort </PERSON> <PERSON> Edelstein </PERSON>. Fire departments from 15 communities battled the fire at the <LOCATION> Hinsdale </LOCATION> station, west of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, for three hours before it was brought under control Sunday evening. The facility houses computerized switching equipment that serves customers by connecting their local calls directly to the number dialed and routing long-distance calls. Customers in the suburbs of <LOCATION> Hinsdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Willowbrook </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Clarendon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> and parts of <LOCATION> Darien </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Burr </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION> and unincorporated <ORGANIZATION> Oak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brook </ORGANIZATION> lost all service, said <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Littel </PERSON>. Some pockets farther south had limited phone service because some of their calls go through the <LOCATION> Hinsdale </LOCATION> station, Ms. <PERSON> Littel </PERSON> said. She said phones were dead for 35,000 customers, but the number of consumers with only partial interruption was unknown. The cause of the fire was unknown. At <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Edelstein </PERSON> said 55 to 60 incoming flights were allowed per hour, down from the normal level of 75. The <LOCATION> Aurora </LOCATION> air traffic control center also handles traffic for <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s Midway Airport. O'Hare's biggest tenant, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, had delays of at least 30 minutes, spokesman <PERSON> Matt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonring </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>New Standard for Handling Currencies Reported</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The world has shifted to a new standard for managing the dollar and other currencies, a transition brought about through secret negotiations worthy of a spy novel, according to a new book released Monday. `` Managing the Dollar: From the Plaza to the Louvre'' traces the high-stakes bargaining between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its major allies over the past three years as the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration sought desperately for solutions to the huge <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficits. But the book, being published by the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> think tank, argues that the agreements, both the public ones and the private deals, have proven `` agonizingly fragile.'' `` The possibility of backsliding, over-committing or reneging has continually threatened the credibilty of these deals,'' author <PERSON> Yoichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Funabashi </PERSON> told reporters at a briefing. <PERSON> Funabashi </PERSON>, a Japanese newspaper reporter, spent a year researching the book, which for the first time throws light on the shadowy world of international monetary agreements reached between the so-called Group of Seven: the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. The book traces the shift in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, which until 1985 stood by as the dollar surged to new highs. It ignored critics who argued that the high-flying dollar was devastating American manufacturers and farmers, whose products were being priced out of world markets. After <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> succeeded <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> as treasury secretary in early 1985, administration policy shifted dramatically. <PERSON> Funabashi </PERSON> said a principal architect of the change was Deputy Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>, who wrote a secret memorandum to <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> in April 1985 outlining a strategy to strengthen international coordination and manage currencies. <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> proposed that the administration promote a move away from the floating exchange rates to currency `` reference ranges.'' From the end of World War II until 1973, the world was on the gold standard, with the price of gold set at $ 35 an ounce and the currencies of other governments set at fixed rates based on the dollar. This system was replaced by floating exchange rates, in which each currency was set on the open market. This process, however, caused extreme volatility and wide swings in the value of the dollar and other currencies, playing havoc with international trade. <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>'s memo argued for the floating exchange rate system to be tamed by the adoption of reference ranges, which would limit currency swings. Currencies would be kept in specified ranges through the use of such tools as intervention, by which governments buy and sell dollars and other currencies on the open market in an effort to influence the value. The first effort at managing the dollar's value came in an agreement between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> at a meeting at the Plaza Hotel in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Sept. 22, 1985. The five countries agreed to use coordinated intervention to drive the value of the dollar lower as a way of correcting the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit. A weaker dollar makes imports more expensive and American products more competitive on overseas markets. The administration considered the negotiations leading up to the Plaza agreement so sensitive that the talking paper distributed to countries before the meeting was called a `` nonpaper'' and its contents were kept secret. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its allies switched course again in February 1987 with the <LOCATION> Louvre </LOCATION> agreement, named for the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> building where the meeting took place, which said that the dollar had declined far enough. The nations pledged to intervene in currency markets to defend the dollar against continued downward pressure and adopted a form of <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>'s reference ranges. The book said the participants agreed to stabilize the dollar to keep it falling more than 5 percent below a base of 153.5 yen to the dollar, a range that has never been publicly confirmed. The dollar has continued to fall, however, and now stands around 125 yen, down more than 18 percent from the lower limit established by the Louvre accord. `` The major story of this book is that it should lay to rest any lingering doubts about whether the world is still on a floating exchange rate system or something else,'' said <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergsten </PERSON>, executive director of the institute. `` The Louvre put into place a rather detailed, reference range system.''

 Leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said today serious differences have developed between the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> over on-site verification provisions of the medium-range missile treaty and urged the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> not to open debate on the pact until they are resolved. `` There are serious problems and until they are resolved I think it would be very difficult to proceed with a full-fledged debate in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>,'' said Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Maine </LOCATION>. `` My feeling is that until these disputes are resolved we should not proceed,'' <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said. Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Boren </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., the chairman of the intelligence panel, agreed `` There are serious ambiguities that remain. There simply has not been a meeting of the minds on verification problems. There are a number of things that have to be resolved,'' he said. Soviet officials have been quoted in recent weeks as backing away from certain on-site inspection procedures spelled out by the treaty. <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> told reporters: `` This is no way to begin a relationship under a treaty as important as this if these deliberate ambiguities remain.'' If they are not resolved quickly, `` I would be very reluctant to proceed,'' <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said that administration officials have said they are encouraged by the nature of recent contacts with Soviet officials on the dispute over the treaty. But <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said he is `` less optimistic'' that differences can be resolved quickly. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> debate on ratification of the treaty had been tenatively been set to begin Wednesday. But <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> said Monday that he will not permit the debate to begin as long as serious problems remain.

 <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> held both Gorbachevs spellbound with <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> stories during the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> summit, according to the latest tales from the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, but after <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> sparkled in dinner table conversation, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> fumed: `` Who does that dame think she is?'' Former White House chief of staff <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>, in his book, `` For the Record,'' published Monday, portrayed a first lady who tried to keep presidential spokesman <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> from uttering the word `` cancer'' when a malignancy was found in her husband's colon and who kept <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> from riding the helicopter to <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> because helicopters were too `` presidential'' for staff members' use And he told of a president who perks up in the presence of women _ and unfailingly offers a fatherly wave to the pretty stewardesses across an airport tarmac. Beyond his disclosure of Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s reliance on a <LOCATION> Nob </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> astrologist, <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>'s book gave out-of-school tales about a first lady with a pervasive, protective role in her husband's presidency. The Iran-Contra arms and money affair made Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s `` sensitivity to criticism more acute than ever,'' <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> wrote, and as a result Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> gave him frequent directions on how to handle the matter `` The first lady's telephoning was so frequent that I was spending two or three times as much time talking to her as to the president,'' he said. Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was influential in <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>'s unceremonious departure from the White House. By then, hard feelings between the two were common knowledge in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. In recalling all _ the latest in a series of White House gossipy memoirs about disarray within the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> presidency _ <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> described how <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, the stylish wife of the Soviet leader, upstaged <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> at their first social session _ a dinner during the 1985 <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> summit. Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was hostess, he wrote, but Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> `` did not confine herself, as most other wives of heads of state and government did in such meetings, to cross-chat with Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on palace housewifery and other harmless subjects. `` Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was a highly educated woman _ a professor of Marxist-Leninist theory,'' <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> said. `` At this dinner party and the later one at the Soviet Mission, she did not hesitate to make use of the opportunities offered to her to educate the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on the intellectual and philosophical basis of Soviet policy. `` It was evident that she was mistress of her subject, an intellectual with a truly impressive grasp of a specialty that she regarded as the key to understanding Soviet society and the world beyond,'' <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> recalled. `` <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> listened to Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s extremely detailed and fervently argued opinions with gallant courtesy `` <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, like any husband in his circumstances, kept his peace,'' <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> said. `` Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, however, chaffed under the monologue. After the door had closed behind the <PERSON> Gorbachevs </PERSON>, she said, ` Who does that dame think she is?''' As for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, he entertained the <PERSON> Gorbachevs </PERSON> with stories about his acting career. They questioned him about how movies are made and how the Hollywood stars live. `` The Gorbachevs devoured every detail,'' <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> said. `` Like any other movie buffs, they were very pleased to be in the company of somebody who had known <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> and <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Bogart </PERSON> and nearly every other famous movie star personally, and was able to describe what they were really like. <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> wrote dryly that the president did not tell the leader of the communist world about his role of driving communists from the union during his terms as president of the <ORGANIZATION> Screen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Actors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> tends to glow in the company of women, <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> wrote: `` The presence of Ambassador <PERSON> Jeane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkpatrick </PERSON> or Secretary of Transportation <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> at a Cabinet meeting always made for a heightened presidential mood; he was more amusing, more talkative, more of a participant than a presence. <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> said everyone who travels with the president has come to believe that <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> assigns its prettiest stewardesses to the plane carrying the White House press corps. `` This happy circumstance did not escape the president's notice,'' he said `` When Air Force One landed, the president always looked for thePan Am stewardesses from the press plane and gave them a fatherly wave. They waved back enthusiastically, pretty young women in their uniforms smiling at the most famous man in the world. `` It was a moment everyone looked forward to on presidential journeys.''

 Despite repeated failures, Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> will make another attempt in early June to persuade <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leaders to agree to negotiations on Palestinian self-rule and an overall Middle East settlement. `` There are problems there that need to be resolved,'' <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said Monday in announcing <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> will visit <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> immediately after the superpower summit in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> will remain in the region from June 3 until a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> foreign ministers in <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> on June 9-10. `` The status quo is not tenable,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said in announcing that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had directed the secretary to try again. After a fact-finding tour of the region last October, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> flew to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> in late February, reported to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> at an allied summit meeting in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> and returned in early March. He made a separate trip in April but failed to line up any of the <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> leaders except <LOCATION> Egyptian </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>. Still, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> vowed to keep at it, fighting the long odds. `` What am I saving myself for, anyway,'' he said at the end of the last venture. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said <PERSON> Arabs </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Israelis </LOCATION> had urged <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> to keep trying. `` All of the people in the region have been very insistent on the fact that the secretary and the administration continue these efforts,'' the spokesman said. He acknowledged, however, that the plan for negotiations had not won approval and declined to specify any changes in position by the various leaders that might make this trip a success. `` The real reason the secretary is going is because at this stage we've not yet been able to bring about the negotiations to which all of this effort is directed,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. Deputy Secretary of State <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> said, meantime, that <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> believes that `` though the prospects for progress may not look encouraging, at the moment he really has no other course but to keep at it.'' He spoke to foreign correspondents at the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> initially hoped a <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> peace conference could be convened in mid-April, setting up negotiations on the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> on May 1 between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and a delegation headed by <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> that included Palestinians. His plan called for a second stage of talks opening Dec. 1 that would deal with an overall settlement of the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> would be invited to join the negotiations. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> appropriations subcommittee two weeks ago that `` under the right circumstances'' King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> would be agreeable to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal for a peace conference. However, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> testified that <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> had made the conference the `` centerpiece'' of his objections to <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s plan. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> also was unsuccessful last month in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in trying to persuade the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to accept a limited role in the negotiations. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> both are opposed to giving the Soviets a chance to shape the outline of a <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> settlement. But <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> is insisting on Soviet involvement. On the other hand, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> is reluctant to negotiate with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> without a guarantee that it would recover all the land it lost during the 1967 Mideast war. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> has advised <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> that was not `` in the cards.'' But he backs the idea of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> trading some territory on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> for peace and said the future of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> should be decided in negotiations. Despite the long odds, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said he did not think his plan was `` fated to failure.''

<TEXT>
 President-elect <PERSON> Rodrigo </PERSON> <PERSON> Borja </PERSON>, a center-left politician, urged business leaders not to be frightened by his election despite his criticism of the free market policies of his predecessor. `` Our victory should not make anyone nervous. No one should start a financial panic. We intend to respect private enterprise,'' he said late Sunday night after winning the presidency. <PERSON> Borja </PERSON>, a 52-year-old law professor, defeated <PERSON> Abdala </PERSON> <PERSON> Bucaram </PERSON>, a 36-year-old populist, by a margin of 52.8 percent to 47.2 percent. The president-elect, whose four-year term begins Aug. 10, will replace <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Febres </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordero </PERSON>, an arch-conservative who has championed free enterprise and has been <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s closest ally in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Borja </PERSON>, who lost a bitterly-fought runoff contest to <PERSON> Febres </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordero </PERSON> in 1984, has pledged to reverse his opponent's free-market policies and seek close ties with the non-aligned Third World movement. `` Now it is Dr. <PERSON> Borja </PERSON>'s turn to show that his political alternative is valid,'' Interior Minister <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> <PERSON> Moeller </PERSON> said Monday. <PERSON> Borja </PERSON> will face the challenge of governing a small nation that has seen its oil-generated prosperity fade away in the past few years as the price of petroleum has dropped. Oil has been the main source of income for <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION> since the early 1970s. The country's foreign reserves have dropped to under $ 50 million, and <PERSON> Febres </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordero </PERSON>, who took pride in keeping up payments on <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>'s $ 9.2 billion foreign debt, was forced to stop repayments last year after devastating earthquakes crippled the country's oil industry for nearly six months. The economy shrank by 3.5 percent in 1987 and annual inflation is running at nearly 70 percent, the highest level in five years. Less than half of the work force is fully employed. <PERSON> Borja </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Left </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> espouses a social democratic doctrine. He has said he will impose exchange controls, restrict imports to save dollar reserves and regulate prices of basic consumer goods to fight inflation. He also announced plans for a more restrictive foreign investment policy and a moratorium on foreign debt payments if creditors do not agree to negotiate easier terms. `` Either we pay the debt or we develop the country. We ca n't do both at the same time,'' he said in a recent meeting with foreign correspondents. <PERSON> Febres </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordero </PERSON>'s policies ran against the trend of left-of-center governments in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, but <PERSON> Borja </PERSON>'s victory pushes <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION> back into the regional pattern. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say they expect no problems in dealing with <PERSON> Borja </PERSON>, who is widely described as highly intelligent, hard-working and honest. But analysts say demands from organized labor for huge wage increases and for quick economic solutions will prove to be a formidable test for the new president, who even his backers say he may not have the strong leadership ability needed to keep the confidence of the population while he seeks solutions. <PERSON> Borja </PERSON> reflected a sense of the limitations of his power when he said Sunday night: `` The condition of the country does not permit miracles.'' `` <PERSON> Borja </PERSON>'s biggest weakness is his lack of charisma,'' said <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortiz </PERSON>, editor of the independent <LOCATION> Quito </LOCATION> newspaper Hy. But <PERSON> Borja </PERSON>, in contrast to the stormy political climate surrounding <PERSON> Febres </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordero </PERSON>, is expected to enjoy a relatively tranquil relationship with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, which his <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Left </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> controls. <PERSON> Febres </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordero </PERSON> had engaged in bitter fights with an opposition-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> throughout his term, during which opposition legislators talked about impeaching him.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> announced Monday he has set a June 21 deadline for committees to draft legislation to step up the government's fight against illegal drugs. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, said he hoped the package would build upon the anti-drug programs <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> passed two years ago, just before the last election. But he denied it was just an election-year ploy. `` Anything we do that people like'' is denigrated as motivated by re-election politics, he said, but that should not deter lawmakers. `` We can not sit by as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> loses the war against drugs,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has already been attaching anti-drug amendments to existing legislation. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted to bypass <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' commitment to limit overall spending in order to add $ 2.6 billion to its fiscal 1989 budget for an upcoming anti-drug bill. The House has voted for additional money for the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and new powers for the military to intercept drugs coming into the country. The legislation <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said would be completed next month would be like the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> proposals, with money for programs such as treatment of addicts, law enforcement and prison construction. He said the cost had not yet been determined. `` We'll see how much it takes and then we'll find ways to pay for it,'' he said. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., would be working with Republicans to make the bill bipartisan However, <PERSON> Republicans </PERSON> said the Democrats already were drafting the legislation without GOP input. While the Democratic proposals center on increased federal spending, Republicans are drafting alternatives that would increase penalties for drug offenders, including capital punishment for traffickers involved in deaths.

 Rebels fired rockets into the <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> capital of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> Monday, killing at least 11 people and most of the victims were children, the Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported. The unusually heavy attack on <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> came less than a week before the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is to begin withdrawing its 115,000 military personnel from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The Soviets sent the troops into the country beginning in December 1979 to help the Marxist government battle anti-communist rebels. In a short dispatch from <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said 17 rockets were fired into densely populated districts of the city ringed by the Hindu Kush mountains. `` The missiles fell mainly between houses on lawns where children were playing,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. `` According to preliminary data, not less than 11 people were killed, mainly children,'' and 12 people were wounded. The Soviets are to start removing their troops Sunday under U.N.-mediated accords between <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> that were signed April 14 in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. Under the agreement, the Soviet military units are to leave <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> within nine months. Soviet officials have said privately they want all the troops home by the end of the year. Rebel rocket strikes on <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> used to occur frequently, but Western diplomats based there told visiting reporters in April the attacks became less frequent in recent months as Soviet and Afghan troops gained more control of areas aound the capital. In <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, rebel leaders issued a statement saying guerrillas had captured another government post in northern <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> as Soviet-Afghan forces continued vacating positions. It said rebels seized the headquarters of an administrative district in <LOCATION> Takhar </LOCATION> province near the Soviet border Sunday. That brought to nine the number of government strongholds the rebels claime they have captured since late April. Millions of Afghan refugees who fled the war are living in camps in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and most of the rebel organizations have headquarters in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>US to Seek Information From Algeria About Hostages</HEAD>

 A senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomat headed for <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> on Monday to seek information about the whereabouts of American hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and to discuss relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Deputy Secretary of State <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> said he also will ask Algerian authorities to cooperate with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in apprehending the hijackers who took over a <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> jetliner last month and flew it to <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION>, killing two hostages along the way. <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> spoke to foreign correspondents at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> hours before leaving for a week-long swing through <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>. `` We'll be talking, particularly to the Algerians, about the hostage situation, to determine if there's anything they known about our American hostages still in captivity and to see if there's any role that they can play,'' <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> said. There are nine Americans among 18 foreigners believed held by pro-Iranian radicals in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, with its history of international mediation, acted as a broker in securing the 1981 release of 52 American hostages held by Iranians at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassy in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> for more than a year. <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> will likely discuss the fate of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hostages when he meets next week in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> with <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> officials. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> negotiated the release of its remaining three hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> last week. Softening recent <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> criticism of <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` had no basis to criticize in any severe way'' <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>'s handling of the Kuwaiti hijacking. Algerian officials mediated an end to the 16-day hijacking, freeing the 31 hostages and spiriting the hijackers to an unknown destinations. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials initially expressed anger that the Algerians allowed the hijackers to get away. <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> said the Algerians had to balance the desire to catch the hijackers with concern for the safety of the hostages. `` It was a difficult job,'' he said. `` We hope <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> will participate with us in further efforts to apprehend the hijackers,'' <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> added. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> still does not know whether the hijackers left <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION>, he said, despite news reports that the seven or nine pirates flew to <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and from there made their way to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Discussing his planned talks in <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> said he would make it clear to the authorities there that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> did not have any role in last month's assassination of <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>. <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>, the number two man in the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> is believed to have been killed by Israeli commandos.

 The man <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> left `` minding the store'' in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> while running for president is a veteran of 40 years in and around government. <PERSON> Hale </PERSON> Champion has been a reporter, a <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> official, an aide to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> and a health official in the <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administration. Balding, rotund and 65, Champion gives the impression that he's seen it all and that nothing fazes him _ not complaining legislators or angry lobbyists, budget shortfalls or the way the news media covers it all To read one <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> newspaper, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' chief secretary said in an interview last week, `` you would have thought blood was coursing through the corridors of the <ORGANIZATION> Statehouse </ORGANIZATION>, entrails draped over the balconies. `` Where? Who? I mean it's simply a bunch of people doing their work.'' Just doing your job. `` That's the way he looks at it,'' Champion said of his boss, the governor who has risen to become the Democratic presidential front-runner. `` Sometimes that's why people think he's not exciting enough, not emotional enough.'' But, said Champion, `` that's what I like about him. I mean that's what gets things done. That's what gets things taken care of, not emoting hour after hour. `` And if that says I am unemotional about those things, maybe I am.'' Champion's strength is that `` there is n't anything that he can think of that he has n't seen before,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' press secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorsey </PERSON>. `` He's sort of like a deeply set foundation'' for the administration. Champion himself was a press secretary, and then executive secretary and finance director for <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, who was <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s predecessor as governor of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> His career also includes financial vice presidencies at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>; a stint as director of the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Redevelopment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>, when he first met <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, and two years as undersecretary to <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Califano </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION> in the <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administration. He was in semi-retirement as executive dean of <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> when <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> tapped him to become his chief secretary a year ago. `` I was never interested in working, you need to understand,'' he said with a smile. `` He resisted my arguments and persuaded my wife, and here I am.'' Considering Champion's background and symmetry of thinking with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, little had to be discussed between the two on what the job entailed. `` He and I both assumed that I knew what ` minding the store' meant,'' Champion said. He has faced comparisons to <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON>, the politically savvy, longtime <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> associate who had been chief secretary before moving over to run the campaign. <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON> later left over his part in the `` attack video'' episode that helped drive Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> from the presidential race. Some lawmakers have criticized the lack of courting they get from Champion. `` I do n't do as much of it as <PERSON> John </PERSON> did ... never will, never did when I did this kind of job before -LRB- for <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> -RRB-,'' Champion said. But he keeps in close contact with legislative leaders, and that to Champion is most important. While Champion frequently remarks on how there is nothing new under the sun in his job, there are some aspects that are different in keeping an administration going while the chief executive is running for president. First, he must make sure <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is abreast of events back in the state while the governor spends three or more days a week on the campaign trail. Second, he has been chiefly in charge of bringing <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' constitutional successor, Lt. Gov. <PERSON> Evelyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, more into the daily operations of the administration. And third, he has found that virtually every administration initiative _ from a universal health care bill to the state budget _ and many bills being pushed by individual lawmakers are publicly cast in the context of the impact on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' presidential campaign. `` At first I did get a little bit -LRB- upset -RRB-,'' said Champion. `` It's ridiculous, but it's every single thing.'' But Champion said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and his administration have tried to solve any problems in that area by living the old saying, `` What's good politics is good government. `` If you look like you are doing what you ought to be doing generally, as against a gim me here and a gim me there, that's the best politics,'' Champion said. `` As a matter of fact, that's why <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> is where he is today, because he has always taken that kind of attitude.'' Champion said he is n't interested in a return trip to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> if <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is elected. Rather, he's counting down the last months he believes he will be in his present post and is looking beyond the part-time teaching position waiting for him at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>. What he's really looking forward to, he said, `` is that time when I am not even teaching.''

 City government came to a standstill Monday while thousands of people streamed by the coffin of <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Caliguiri </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> City-County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Building </LOCATION>, where he governed <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. `` I did n't know him personally, but I liked him. He was one of the nicest persons. I'm going to start crying and I'm not even related to him,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ronschke </PERSON>, 75, a <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> resident who waited in line. An estimated 2,000 people viewed the flag-draped coffin in the first hour after the doors were opened. Gov. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> was among those who filed past the coffin. <PERSON> Caliguiri </PERSON>'s heart stopped Friday from what his doctors said was an accumulation of protein caused by the rare, incurable disease, amyloidosis. He was 56 and in his 12th year as mayor. He was credited with steering <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> through the collapse of steelmaking in the area. Monday was an official day of mourning. City offices, courts, public and parochial schools, and buildings were closed. After a funeral Mass on Tuesday, <PERSON> Caliguiri </PERSON> will be buried two plots away from his mother, <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Calvary </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cemetery </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. `` It'll be quite a while before we have another one like him,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Esposito </PERSON>. `` I do n't think anybody perceived what a symbol this young, unpretentious man came to be. He remained true to the common man, kept his honesty and his values.'' <PERSON> Esposito </PERSON>, an emergency medical services official, recalled <PERSON> Caliguiri </PERSON>'s efforts as a <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> member to help improve ambulance service in western <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. `` <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> was the first member of this city body who was perceptive enough to know that that was an issue worth giving his support and understanding to,'' he said. `` This young man had the courage to support that issue through all the turmoils and battles that ensued. `` This city now enjoys as fine a paramedic protection as any municipality in the country.'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, social service administrator for the <ORGANIZATION> Neighborhood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said he liked <PERSON> Caliguiri </PERSON> for something else the mayor helped give the city. `` He has never done anything for me personally, but I appreciate the fact that he was able to keep our streets in good condition,'' he said. `` He had begun to make <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> a city that one could be proud of. I often have visitors from out of town, and I'm just so pleased to be able to show them the progress that has been made.'' `` He was a gift at a time when we needed a gift,'' state <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Acquaviva </PERSON> said as he waited in line. <PERSON> Acquaviva </PERSON> credited <PERSON> Caliguiri </PERSON> for his reaction to the collapse of steelmaking in the cradle of the steel industry. `` Most politicians would be defensive when things are crumbling, but he drew upon both the public and private sector to make some pretty bold initiatives,'' <PERSON> Acquaviva </PERSON> said. `` When we deal with unemployment numbers, we're dealing with numbers, but he looked at it as people.''

<HEAD>Report Says Agency Not Buying Equipment Wisely</HEAD>

 Congressional investigators have determined that the <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> is wasting millions of tax dollars on unneeded equipment it can not use, a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee chairman said Monday. Rep. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> English, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., said a one-year review by the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> found the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> apparently `` has no consistent method of deciding what it needs or how to purchase equpment that would fill those needs The result is that at best we're getting equipment that does n't really do the job.'' The <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> responded Monday to concerns raised in the report with plans to establish a research and development steering committee that will develop procurement procedures based on some <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> recommendations, said spokesman <PERSON> Verne </PERSON> <PERSON> Jervis </PERSON>. The INS planning office, which includes research and development, will also be moved so that it reports directly to the INS commissioner's office, where it will receive `` enhanced visibility and increased access to top management,'' <PERSON> Jervis </PERSON> said. English said he was concerned efforts in the war on drugs were being hurt by the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION>' apparent waste of `` millions of dollars on equipment the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> ca n't really use.'' `` There's no question that <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> and particularly the <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> are underfunded when it comes to the war on drugs. Therefore, money wasted on unwise purchases is money that can not be used to halt the flow of drugs across our borders,'' he said in a statement. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> report, to be released Thursday at a hearing by English's government information, justice and agriculture subcommittee, found that `` the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> had no defined, formal method of technology selection.'' In one instance, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> found the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> had ordered the purchase of 11 undercover vans outfitted with an extendable infrared scope for monitoring the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> borders, at a cost of more than $ 130,000 for each vehicle, even though operational tests were incomplete. And the report said the infrared scopes, which could have been used to support linewatch operations in various Border Patrol sectors, sat unused for at least 7 -LCB- months at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huachuca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION> `` Had those scopes been available for use in detection in various sectors, some <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> agents could have been deployed for other activities. The value of the agents' work that was foregone by the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> as a result is estimated to be in the range of $ 1.4 million to $ 3.4 million,'' the report said.

<HEAD>Milk Producers Federation Asks Farmers to Lobby Against
Price-Support Cuts</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Nation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Milk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Producers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> asked dairy farmers Monday to join its lobbying effort to stop a further cut in federal milk price supports scheduled by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> next year. The 72-year-old federation, which represents most of the nation's dairy cooperatives, wants <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> to use his authority in the 1985 farm law to cancel the next reduction in milk supports on Jan. 1, 1989, in favor of an alternate plan to cut production. `` Enough is enough,'' said federation president <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Camerlo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Canon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION> `` Dairy farmers are tired of suffering continual price reductions after having done more to address federal policy concerns than any segment of <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. agriculture.'' <PERSON> Camerlo </PERSON> said <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> has the authority to set up a new whole-herd buyout or a diversion program, both of which have been used in recent years to trim <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> milk production. However, <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> has been steadfast against reviving the buyout and diversion programs as an alternative to the reduction in price supports. Camerlo and other federation officials told a news conference at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> that the 50-cent reduction scheduled for next Jan. 1 would put the milk support level at $ 10.10 per 100 pounds of milk, the lowest since 1979. `` Dairy farmers will have to live at 1979 income levels with 1989 costs,'' he said. Milk price supports have been lowered progressively from a record high of $ 13.10 per 100 pounds since 1983 to help discourage surplus production. A diversion plan to pay farmers for cutting back production, and a whole-herd buyout, or Dairy Termination Program, also were used. The 18-month whole-herd buyout program began April 1, 1986, and continued through October 1987. More than 1.22 million dairy cows, heifers and calves were sent to market by thousands of producers who agreed to quit the dairy business for at least five years. About 38 percent of the buyout program's cost of $ 1.8 billion was paid by dairy farmers themselves who were charged assessments on milk they sold. Similar arrangements helped hold down costs on the earlier diversion plan. <PERSON> Camerlo </PERSON> said the 50-cent reduction next Jan. 1 would come as milk production costs, including feed, are on the upswing. The two-way crunch would add up next year to a 37 percent slide in dairy farm income from 1987 levels, he said. Dairy farmers have contributed $ 2.9 billion in assessments since 1983 to reduce the costs of their programs by 50 percent overall, <PERSON> Camerlo </PERSON> said. Federation leaders have met frequently with <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> officials, including <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON>, in an attempt to persuade them to abandon the path of lower milk supports. `` The secretary has been consistent, as has his staff, that they will cut the price,'' <PERSON> Camerlo </PERSON> said. `` They do not intend to utilize the authority that they have in the'85 act to implement a whole-herd or Dairy Termination Program.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION> on Monday released a list of prominent Democratic women and said the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> should consider them for key convention roles as well as for the vice presidential nomination. NOW also urged the Democrats to continue official support of the Equal Rights Amendment, abortion rights and gay rights, and to add a new platform plank promoting women candidates. `` We think it would be a very serious mistake'' to eliminate all potentially controversial issues from the platform, NOW President <PERSON> Molly </PERSON> <PERSON> Yard </PERSON> said at a news conference a day before she was scheduled to testify before the party's platform committee. Yard distributed a list of 47 prominent Democratic women, saying she wants the party to consider them as national convention speakers and officers as well as potential running mates. On the list are current and former office-holders from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> down to city council, including former <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON>, who was chosen by <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> as his running mate in 1984. Women's groups, including NOW, heavily lobbied <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> to put a woman on the ticket. Others on the list include Rep. <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Madeleine </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunin </PERSON>, Rep. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennelly </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitmire </PERSON>, former <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Dianne </PERSON> <PERSON> Feinstein </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Mikulski </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>. Asked which vice presidential nominees would be acceptable or unacceptable to NOW this year, former NOW chief <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Smeal </PERSON> named Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> as a negative example. Citing the <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> senator's support for banning abortion and for an ERA only with amendments, she said, `` His position on women's issues would not be called exemplary.'' `` We want both parties to consider a woman vice presidential candidate,'' <PERSON> Smeal </PERSON> said. `` There are plenty of prospective candidates out there who are women and we think they should be considered seriously.'' <PERSON> Smeal </PERSON> and <PERSON> Yard </PERSON> said they are confident ERA, abortion and gay rights, as well as others supporting child care, family leave, pay equity and a minimum wage hike, will remain in the platform. `` They do n't have the votes to delete these planks. They're just not there,'' <PERSON> Smeal </PERSON> said. She said there would be a strong feminist contingent at the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> convention in July. <PERSON> Smeal </PERSON> said she would introduce a new platform plank requiring equal representation of women candidates in primaries. She noted the Democrats already have a rule requiring equal numbers of men and women on committees and at conventions. Under her proposal, endorsements by <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> organizations would have to be split 50-50 between male and female candidates. She said she intends to press it at the Republican convention as well. <PERSON> Smeal </PERSON> said the current system amounts to `` incumbent protection clubs'' that give people `` 30 years of job security whether they're doing the job or not ... This is just suicide to have a policy that is keeping their decisionmakers virtually all white men.'' Democratic leaders, including party chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON>, have said they may try to win a brief platform acceptable to all Democrats that excludes specific mention of controversial topics.

 Police broke down the doors of a country cottage where a dissident group planned to meet and arrested five people Monday. Sources said 70 other activists met nearby and founded an alternative party to the Communist Party. The new group calls itself the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. It seeks a multiparty parliamentary democracy in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, independent trade unions, a new constitution and withdrawal of Soviet troops from Eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and areas of the present <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> seized in World War II. Over the weekend, 60 of its supporters were reported arrested in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and one of the group's founders, <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Mityunov </PERSON>, said Monday that 14 remained in jail after being arrested Sunday night. Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has called for more democratic election procedures, including multiple-candidate elections. But the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> he heads has given no sign that it will accept any organized opposition to its monopoly on political power, which is enshrined in the Soviet constitution. <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Babitsky </PERSON>, an editor of the dissident journal Glasnost, said uniformed and plainclothes police encircled a cottage in the woods near the village of <LOCATION> Kratovo </LOCATION>, 25 miles southeast of the capital, where the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> planned to meet Monday afternoon. The two-floor wooden cottage has been used for meetings of the staff of Glasnost, an unofficial publication that takes its title from the Russian word for openness. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has used glasnost to describe some of his reforms. `` A militia officer asked to see our identification documents, but we refused, saying there was no grounds,'' <PERSON> Babitsky </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` He then went for reinforcements, and about 50 uniformed militia, plainclothesmen and <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> officers suddenly appeared. They had obviously been waiting nearby.'' <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON>, a former political prisoner who is the founding editor of Glasnost, was arrested on the lawn outside, <PERSON> Babitsky </PERSON> said. `` We closed all five doors to the dacha, but police broke them in,'' he added. <PERSON> Babitsky </PERSON> said he was arrested along with <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrovsky </PERSON>, who also works with Glasnost; <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuzin </PERSON>, a founder of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, and a man known only as <PERSON> Volodya </PERSON> who <PERSON> Babitsky </PERSON> said was in the vicinity of the cottage by chance. <PERSON> Babitsky </PERSON> said he was held for almost nine hours without being charged, then released by police shortly before 9 p.m. with no explanation. Another dissident was in the country house, but fled before he could be detained, another Glasnost editor, <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Krivov </PERSON>, said in a telephone interview Monday night. <PERSON> Krivov </PERSON> said people who talked to <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON> at the police station in <LOCATION> Ilinskoye </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Kratovo </LOCATION>, reported that <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON> `` was frisked, his clothes were ripped, and a large sum of money he was carrying was taken.'' Mityunov reported by telephone that about 70 members of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, kept from meeting at the cottage, gathered at a nearby rural club. `` In a half-hour, they adopted the basic program for the party, a declaration and a charter,'' he said. `` I think the formation of the party is a big event in the unification of forces to fight against the bureaucratic totalitarian regime,'' said <PERSON> Mityunov </PERSON>, a former member of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> who was fired from his editorial job on state-run Radio <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in 1986. <PERSON> Babitsky </PERSON> said he learned from <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON>' wife <PERSON> Tamara </PERSON> that the Glasnost editor-in-chief was sentenced to seven days in jail for resisting authorities. `` I saw him arrested, and he did not such thing,'' <PERSON> Babitsky </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Petrovsky </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kuzin </PERSON> and the man known as <PERSON> Volodya </PERSON> received five-day jail terms, but the dissidents group did not know on what charges, <PERSON> Babitsky </PERSON> said. The Kratovo cottage was sealed by police and newspapers and books inside may have been taken away by investigators, <PERSON> Babitsky </PERSON> said. ` I fear this action may be the defeat of ` Glasnost,''' he added. The typewritten journal began appearing last year. Kratovo is located in a region foreigners are barred by law from visiting. The Soviet constitution calls the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> the `` leading and guiding force of Soviet society and the nucleus of its political system.'' Although new dissident groups and independent publications have sprung up up throughout the country since hundreds of political prisoners were freed in early 1987, authorities have crushed efforts to form an opposition to the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Pentagon Says US Can't Afford to Fall Further Behind in Star Wars
Research</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can not afford from a military perspective to fall further behind in its `` Star Wars'' research, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, in a required annual report on the Strategic Defense Initiative, or Star Wars program, said even 3 percent annual increases in funding for the research would not be enough to `` keep pace'' with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The Russians continue to modernize their offensive as well as defensive weaponry, gradually improving their ability to destroy <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces with a surprise attack, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> report said. `` The resulting asymmetry between <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces has led to a destabilizing situation, one that must be redressed,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said. A Star Wars defense system that could shoot down Soviet missiles offers the promise of a more stable peace, the Pentagon insisted. The mere process of attempting to develop such a system complicates Soviet military planning and strains the Russian economy. If, on the other hand, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> continues to cut deeply into Star Wars funding, `` the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will not only waste its greatest leverage _ the innovation possible in a free society _ but it can not expect to do more than react to Soviet initiatives in strategic defense,'' the Pentagon said. `` We are faced with either delaying the time when a decision on whether to deploy defenses could be made, or eliminating some technology efforts, thereby reducing the number of defense options that can support a decision.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> included the new plea for funding in a report that runs to several hundred pages, reviewing the work done over the past year in various technological fields. Release of the report comes just a week after <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> warned he would recommend that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> veto the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s fiscal 1989 budget bill if cuts are made to the $ 4.5 billion requested for Star Wars. While the administration has been forced to abandon its goal of increasing overall defense spending by 3 percent a year, it continues to request steep hikes for Star Wars. Since 1983, however, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has cut almost $ 5 billion from the roughly $ 18 billion requested for <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wars </ORGANIZATION>. `` While the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has increased -LRB- Star Wars -RRB- funding every year, the difference between what the administration has requested and what the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has appropriated is so large that it has had a substantial and increasingly detrimental impact on the program,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> asserted.

 Anti-abortion activists expressed disappointment Monday at <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s reported declaration that `` I do n't give a damn about the right-to-lifers,'' but they praised President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s steadfast support for their cause. The first lady was quoted by former White House chief of staff <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> in his new book, `` For the Record: From Wall Street to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> wrote that during a telephone conversation from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> with Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> at Camp David, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, on Jan. 24, 1987, the first lady demanded that all mention of the abortion issue be eliminated from the draft text of her husband's State of the Union address. `` I pointed out that the president had particularly wanted some language on this subject included in his address,'' <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> said he responded. He quoted Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as saying: `` I do n't give a damn about the right-to-lifers.'' The State of the Union speech that the president delivered three days later contained no references to abortions. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters Monday that `` I do n't have any knowledge at all'' whether Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> actually made such a statement. <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Crispen </PERSON>, the first lady's press secretary, refused comment. Anti-abortion leaders, asked for reaction, refrained from any direct criticism of Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and chose instead to praise her husband for his unwavering support. `` If, in fact, Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s quote is accurate, we are very disappointed, but it does not affect the respect we have for how the president has helped the pro-life movement throughout his administration,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Glessner </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, an evangelical Protestant organization. `` We would ask Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to ... let us know if, in fact, this is how she regards the right-to-life movement,'' <PERSON> Glessner </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON>, public affairs director for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Right </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, the largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> anti-abortion organization, refused to discuss the first lady or her remarks. `` I think what's important is what the president has done,'' she said. `` What is apparent to us is that the president has always been extremely supportive in all his speeches, his initiatives and his policies, and that's what we have to go on.'' Said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> bureau chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Ad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hoc </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION>, an anti-abortion lobbying group: `` It's upsetting, if it is true, although it does n't change our attitude toward the president himself We know the president is pro-life.''

 American hostage <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s greatest fear is a commando raid against his captors in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, an action that would mean his certain death, a Frenchman who shared a cell with <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said Monday. <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Fontaine </PERSON>, 45, a diplomat released last week after nearly three years of captivity, said he and <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> were in the same cell for six months and frequently spoke of the possibility that either the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> or the Americans would turn to military action. `` We were afraid,'' <PERSON> Fontaine </PERSON> told <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s sister, <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Say </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Batavia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, during a meeting in his home. `` Every time anybody knocked on the door, two guards immediately stepped in, pointed guns at us and waited for whoever was going to come in. `` There is no chance that any commandos would ever get in without us being killed. We were all of us always afraid that there would be a commando raid by the French or the Americans.'' Mrs. Say arrived in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> Monday to meet with <PERSON> Fontaine </PERSON> and two other French hostages released Wednesday in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> _ journalist <PERSON> Jean-Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kauffmann </PERSON> and diplomat <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Carton </PERSON>. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 40, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> Correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, was kidnapped in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> March 16, 1985, by pro-Iranian Lebnanese and is the longest held Western hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Lebanese kidnappers are holding 18 foreigners, including nine Americans. <PERSON> Fontaine </PERSON> said <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> does not know that his father and his brother have died since he has been in captivity. The Frenchman said he knew of those deaths because he had heard of them earlier on the radio, but he did n't tell <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> for fear it would have a serious effect on his morale. Probably the second greatest worry of the hostages, said <PERSON> Fontaine </PERSON>, is becoming seriously ill. He said no medical treatment is allowed, and if they should suffer a serious ailment, they would simply die. That is what happened to another Frenchman, <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Seurat </PERSON>. The Islamic Jihad organization, which claims to be holding <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> and others, claimed <PERSON> Seurat </PERSON> was killed. But the recently returned Frenchmen said he died of illness, probably cancer. <PERSON> Fontaine </PERSON> said <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s morale is high. The diplomat frequently praised <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s courage. He said <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> exercises continuously, walking round and round in his cell to keep fit. <PERSON> Fontaine </PERSON> said he began teaching Anderson French, and he has learned to read it rather well. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, in turn, taught Fontaine English.

Rival <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> exhorted coal miners to help him turn the race around on the eve of primaries in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>. An aide to Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, meanwhile, acknowledged that the vice president was aware of allegations of drug trafficking by the government of Panamanian strongman Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> well before <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s indictment this year _ an issue on which both <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> have been attacking <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign spokesman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Teeley </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> viewed the information as speculative at the time. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> alone among the three remaining presidential candidates was actively campaigning Monday. He spent Sunday night at the home of an unemployed coal miner and his wife, <PERSON> Junior </PERSON> and <PERSON> Becky </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, in all-white <PERSON> Arnett </PERSON>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>. More than 500 people showed up to greet him in the economically depressed town of only 300 `` They have their race, but they do n't have jobs,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` They have their race, but they do n't have health insurance. They have their race, but they do n't have hot and cold running water,'' he said. `` Their race does not address those needs.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> visited a coal mine in southern <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, then visited a toxic waste dump as he toured the state, saying his call for economic help was cutting across racial lines. There are 37 Democratic delegates at stake in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> primary, and 25 in <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> made only brief campaign forays into both <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> last week. He has a commanding lead in delegates to the Democratic National Convention. Still, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told 1,500 people in <LOCATION> Martinsburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>: `` We're within striking <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, you can make a difference.'' `` The race is tight,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` I'm coming to the last lap. I'm running longer and running stronger because my mind is made up. We've come too far. We've got to go on now. Press on. Press on. Press on.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spent the day at the <ORGANIZATION> Statehouse </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, where the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor met with <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> for a briefing on U.S.-Soviet relations. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> did not come out to comment to reporters after the hour-long meeting. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> said the subject of the vice presidential spot on a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> ticket was not discussed. He added, `` That's not in the cards. <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> do n't go well together.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> planned meetings with other members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> during a stopover in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Thursday before flying west to campaign in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aides said the governor will begin receiving <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> protection Wednesday. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has previously declined the protection. Questions about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s knowledge of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s alleged drug dealing have emerged as an issue in the presidential race, with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> both asserting the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration continued to deal with the Panamanian dictator despite evidence of drug invovlement. They have pointed to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s experience as former head of the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>, and head of the admnistration's task force on federal drug interdiction, as evidence he knew or should have known about <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <PERSON> Teeley </PERSON>, answering questions about the issue, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s assertion that he had no prior knowledge of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s specific drug dealings does not suggest he was completely in the dark on the possibility He said <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> was one of a number of countries about which there were such reports. `` I think anybody who knows anything about what's gone on in the world of international narcotics trafficking is fully aware that there are all sorts of rumors and reports about foreign officials being involved in drug trafficking, money laundering and payoffs,'' <PERSON> Teeley </PERSON> said. `` Some turn out to be accurate, some are not.'' In other developments: _ <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> came under fresh attack from former Democratic Gov. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. King of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, who beat him in 1978 but lost their rematch in 1982. King, now a Republican, has appeared on television and radio shows in recent weeks to criticize <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, with his expenses paid for by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign. In a <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, speech, <PERSON> King </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> deserves no credit for the state's economic turnaround. _ <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was endorsed by Gov. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> won the state's primary overwhelmingly two weeks ago. He also picked up public backing from Rep. <PERSON> Harley </PERSON> <PERSON> O </PERSON>.

Thousands of people, including many peasants in Indian dress and the traditional bowler hats, welcomed the pontiff at the La Paz airport, 13,150 feet above sea level and ringed by snow-capped Andean peaks. The pope arrived from <LOCATION> Montevideo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>, aboard a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 of the Bolivian state airline. The jetliner's oxygen level was reduced to prepare <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> for his visit to high-altitude <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>. A <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> advance team had already been sent to the mountainous capital to test the possible effects of kneeling and kissing the ground at such an altitude. On his four-nation, 12-day visit to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, which began Friday, the 67-year-old pontiff was also scheduled to travel to <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>. The pope's schedule calls for five days in <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> where government austerity measures that eliminated 20,000-percent annual inflation have caused serious labor unrest due to mass layoffs. The country is also a major source of the world's cocaine. In <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>, where the pope made an overnight stop in March 1987, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> asked for a renewal of religious fervor and for more priests. This small nation of 3 million is <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s most secularized society, with an agnostic president and only lukewarm interest in church affairs. After arriving in <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> Saturday, the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> visited the towns of <PERSON> Melo </PERSON> near <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> outside the capital of <LOCATION> Montevideo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Salto </LOCATION> on the northwestern frontier with <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> was presented with gifts ranging from a live fawn to a nest of a local birds. In <LOCATION> Salto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>'s second-largest city with 77,000 residents, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> spoke at a mass Monday about his hopes for a renewal of evangelization in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, saying `` religious fervor is not fanaticism but is coherent with Christian life.'' Earlier Monday, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> met privately in <LOCATION> Montevideo </LOCATION> with President <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanguinetti </PERSON>, an agnostic. <PERSON> Sanguinetti </PERSON>, a highly popular leader, became president in 1985 when he restored democracy to <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> after 12 years of harsh military rule. Papal aides said in <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> that the pope has been buoyed by the official reception he has received in a country where divorce has been legal since 1907 and Christmas is called `` Families Day'' to avoid religious connotations. `` We hope this is the start of a new climate,'' said a <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> official, speaking on condition of anonymity. The pope's tour is his ninth to <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> since he became head of the 860-million-member <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> nearly 10 years ago. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> ha traveled abroad on papal pilgrimages 37 times. This trip takes the pontiff to <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> for the first time. He visited <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> in 1985. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> is scheduled to spend his 68th birthday in <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> on May 18 and returns to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> on May 19.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Heinlein </PERSON>, whose science fiction explored the future while questioning the morals and beliefs of the present, has died at the age of 80, it was announced Monday. <PERSON> Heinlein </PERSON>, who added the word `` grok'' to the language and dreamed up the water bed, was ranked with <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON> <PERSON> Asimov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON> among the greatest practitioners of science fiction. His fiction explored the seeming contraditions of his own philosophy, which embraced libertarianism and a passionate faith in the military. He died of heart failure Sunday at his home in this small tourist community about 130 miles south of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Monterey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Coroner's office. <PERSON> Heinlein </PERSON> had suffered for many years from emphysema and had undergone numerous operations, including one to relieve restricted blood flow to his brain. `` <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Heinlein </PERSON> has been writing science fiction now for 48 years and from the very start he was recognized as a grand master,'' <PERSON> Asimov </PERSON> said Monday. `` In 1975 the <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fiction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> set up just such an award, and he was the first to get it. There was no argument, much like <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> becoming the first president.'' <PERSON> Asimov </PERSON> said he and <PERSON> Heinlein </PERSON> had served together in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> during World War II, during <PERSON> Heinlein </PERSON>'s second <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> hitch, and `` formed a close friendship wich never entirely broke up.'' His favorite bit of <PERSON> Heinlein </PERSON> writing was the opening to `` Door Into Summer,'' in which `` he described a cat better than anyone has ever described a cat. The work that impressed me the most was ` Solution Unsatisfactory,' written before the <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> Project, in which he accurately described the current nuclear stalemate.'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Anson </PERSON> <PERSON> Heinlein </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> Butler </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, on July 7, 1907. He graduated from the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> and served for five years, but was forced to retire after contracting tuberculosis. Flat broke after a failed campaign for the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> legislature in 1938, <PERSON> Heinlein </PERSON> saw an ad in Thrilling Wonder Stories magazine offering a $ 50 prize for a story by an amateur. Instead of entering that contest, <PERSON> Heinlein </PERSON> sent his first story to Astounding Science Fiction magazine, which paid him $ 70. His books were written in a spare, matter-of-fact style but presented readers with thoughtful questions about how life should be lived. In his most popular novel, `` Stranger in a Strange Land,'' Valentine <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> is a human raised by Martians. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> challenged his home planet's values with his own priorities, including universal free love, nudity and many sexual encounters. He also `` discorporated'' or made disappear authority figures he felt were bad. The book, which became something of a text for the counter-culture of the 1960s, introduced `` grok,'' <PERSON> Heinlein </PERSON>'s word for intuitive understanding. In that book, <PERSON> Heinlein </PERSON> also introduced the water bed. In `` Methuselah's Children'' and later in other books, character Lazarus Long provides more food for thought. For instance, on how to get help, Long says: `` Never appeal to a man's better nature. He may not have one. Invoking his self-interest gives you more leverage.'' Another <PERSON> Heinlein </PERSON> invention, now in common use worldwide, is a device known as a `` waldo,'' named for the principal character in the short story, `` Magic, Inc.'' <PERSON> Waldo </PERSON>, who was handicapped, invented remote-controlled robot arms. Two years ago, <PERSON> Heinlein </PERSON> told writer <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> that `` writers do n't know how to retire.'' `` The bottom line,'' he said then, `` is ` pay to the order of ...' with the right figures in the blanks. That's the most important measure of a writer's work. Freelance writing is free enterprise.'' <PERSON> Heinlein </PERSON> won numerous awards for his novels and short stories and was popular with both children and adults, and he was not at all ashamed that much of his work was for `` pulp'' magazines, under his own name or pseudonyms. `` They did n't want it good,'' <PERSON> Heinlein </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> in 1980, `` they wanted it Wednesday.'' <PERSON> Heinlein </PERSON> won the Best Science Fiction Novel award from the World Science Fiction Convention in 1956, 1959, 1961 and 1966; the Nebula award from the Science Fiction Writers of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in 1975; and an unprecedented four Hugo awards, in 1956 for `` Double Star,'' in 1959 for `` Starship Troopers,'' in 1961 for `` Stranger in a Strange Land'' and in 1966 for `` The Moon is a Harsh Mistress.'' Other works include `` The <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> of Earth'' and `` Puppet Masters.'' <PERSON> Heinlein </PERSON> is survived by his wife, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, whom he married in 1948. The couple had no children.

 The defense has removed a minor obstacle to the review of classified documents in the Iran-Contra conspiracy case, according to a transcript of a closed court hearing released Monday. Retired Marine Lt. Col. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> and former national security adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> and their lawyers will review a small group of ultra-sensitive documents that government security officials were reluctant to show to arms dealers <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> and retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> is allowing the defense to review the material to verify prosecution claims it is not relevant to charges that the four defendants conspired to illegally divert profits from the U.S.-Iran arms sales to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels. `` We do n't want to be viewed as obstructing this process,'' <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON>'s lawyer <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Janis </PERSON> told <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>, according to the official court transcript of Friday's closed hearing <PERSON> Janis </PERSON> said he and <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON>, agreed to abide by the determination of the other defense lawyers that the documents are not relevant to the case. Independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> estimated that between 35 and 70 pages of sensitive material not relevant to the case have been identified by his office and government security experts. The defense concession does not dispose of the larger problem of disclosing sensitive information that may be determined to be relevant when the case goes to trial. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> issued an order Monday giving <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> until May 30 to draw up a list of secret documents he wants to use as evidence that wo n't be declassified by the government. Under the Classified Information Procedures Act, only the government can declassify documents before they are introduced into evidence. If <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> is unable to persuade government agencies to declassify important evidence, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> could drop some or all of the charges. No trial date has been set. At a hearing two weeks ago, <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> described some of the most sensitive documents in his possession as containing information about <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence and military planning. The disclosure of some secrets could subject some people in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> to torture or death, <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> had said, apparently referring to hostages held there. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> has ruled that each defendant has the right to examine the classified material that <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> has deposited in a secure facility where the defense lawyers are sifting through a massive amount of classified documents compiled by the prosecution. But government security officials have refused <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> access because the material contains a small number of pages of ultra-sensitive material. <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON>, an Iranian-born <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen, has never had a security clearance and <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> has not had one since he left government several years ago. An interdepartmental task force is reviewing some 300,000 pages of classified material. More than 105,000 pages of documents have already been put in the secure room that was constructed by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>.

 <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> led a strike rally at the <ORGANIZATION> Lenin </ORGANIZATION> shipyard Monday and some 700 workers responded, `` We'll win! We'll win!'' They shouted down a management offer and took their strike into its second week. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, who founded the independent union Solidarity at the shipyard in the turbulent summer of 1980, told his comrades he still has a `` couple of beautiful cards'' to play. In his speech, before the workers were asked whether they wanted to continue striking, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said: `` I was afraid we were broken... But the mood is changing. People are coming back'' to the strike. `` Their wives are saying, ` You ca n't abandon them.''' At a prayer meeting in the morning, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> had told the strikers: `` We're in good shape. Those who wanted to leave are gone. Only the tough ones are here.'' The Solidarity founder, a shipyard electrician who won the 1983 Nobel Peace Prize, and strike committee leader <PERSON> Alojzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Szablewski </PERSON> spoke at the 45-minute afternoon rally. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, 44, told the strikers last week he was too tired to lead the strike but would be the last to leave the shipyard. Strikers in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> customarily occupy the plants rather than leaving them. <PERSON> Szablewski </PERSON> said late Monday that <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Goclowski </PERSON>, the Roman Catholic bishop of <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>, was trying to get talks with management started again but there were no signs of resumption. Shipyard workers turned down the management offer of pay raises and reinstatement of some fired activists because it did not include a legally recognized chapter of Solidarity. The independent union, first in the Soviet bloc, was suppressed and then outlawed after martial law was declared Dec. 13, 1981. State television reported the rejection of the management offer and said in an official commentary: `` The hint of hope for a positive solution which we presented on Saturday and Sunday in our newscasts turned out to be illusory. The organizers of the illegal strike are rejecting every initiative for a conciliatory and humanitarian settlement.'' <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s communist government has not ruled out ending the strike with force. A pre-dawn police raid last Thursday crushed a 10-day strike by steel workers at <LOCATION> Nowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huta </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. Workers at the 15,000-employee <ORGANIZATION> Ursus </ORGANIZATION> tractor factory outside <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> tried to mount a strike Monday in sympathy with those at <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> shipyard, but it fizzled. Opposition spokeswoman <PERSON> Ewa </PERSON> <PERSON> Milewicz </PERSON> said most of the tractor plant's first shift refused to work and employees leaving the plant told a photographer at 2 p.m. the strike included about 1,000 people from three departments. Employees leaving later, however, reported only about 100 strikers occupying a canteen and said they ended the protest by 9 p.m. The official news agency <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> denied there had been a strike. Western reporters who were at the 11,000-worker Lenin shipyard late Sunday said about 300 strikers remained. Their number appeared to have more than doubled by the time <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> spoke at midafternoon Monday. `` If I can find a way to win this strike, I'll have a second Nobel in the pocket,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said. `` We'll win! We'll win!'' the workers shouted. `` I have a couple of beautiful cards in my hands that I have n't played yet,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said Rejection of the settlement offer came after talks that lasted more than four hours and ended soon after 8 a.m.. A morning rally ended with the crowd chanting, `` There is no freedom without Solidarity! The second rally was held because the strike committee said it wanted the workers to give the matter more thought. A mediator, lawyer <PERSON> Wladyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Sila-Nowicki </PERSON>, also advised them to reconsider the proposal, but the strikers again rejected it. <PERSON> Sila-Nowicki </PERSON> said he had spoken several times with Gen. <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszcaak </PERSON>, the interior minister. The lawyer said <PERSON> Kiszcaak </PERSON> assured the workers they would not be prosecuted or fired for striking if they took the offer. <PERSON> Sila-Nowicki </PERSON> said management had agreed to a joint commission of strike committee members and management to oversee implementation of the agreement. Management had rejected that point Sunday. Management agreed to a 15,000-zloty -LRB- $ 38 -RRB- monthly pay raise, but the total included some raises already promised, and said Solidarity activists fired after the imposition of martial law in 1981 would be rehired as needed. Martial law was lifted later, replaced with tough new regulations. Pay at the Lenin shipyard averages 42,000 zlotys -LRB- $ 105 -RRB- monthly. <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> also promised the release of most political prisoners, including some jailed since the strikes began two weeks ago, <PERSON> Sila-Nowicki </PERSON> said. Ten Western journalists were detained Monday after leaving the shipyard, held about 2 -LCB- hours and released after polite questioning. Film and tape recordings were confiscated and the reporters were told not to enter the yard again without permission. Those detained were a reporter and photographer for <ORGANIZATION> Reuters </ORGANIZATION>, a reporter for the West German agency <ORGANIZATION> DPA </ORGANIZATION>, a reporter and photographer for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, reporters for the <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION> and a three-member West German television crew.

<TEXT>
 Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> presided Monday at the opening of <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s new <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, which took nearly $ 1 billion and eight years to build. About 2,000 aborigines protested outside. The British queen called the building a crowning expression of Australian faith in parliamentary democracy and noted that it replaces a provisional <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> building opened 61 years earlier by her father, King <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> VI </PERSON>. Aboriginal activists and sympathizers began gathering at dawn to protest the proceedings and their number grew to about 2,000 by the time the queen arrived. Chants of `` Shame, shame, shame!'' and `` We want land rights now!'' virtually drowned out the national anthem `` Advance Australia Fair'' during welcoming ceremonies attended by Prime Minister <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> and other dignitaries. <PERSON> Robyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Dass </PERSON>, an aboriginal activist, said the new building is on a site sacred to the aborigines. Police said cables of the outdoor public address system were cut before the queen arrived but were restored about 10 minutes into the ceremony. The opening of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> is a highlight of year-long celebrations of the 200th anniversary of the European settlement of <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. At a final cost of $ 1.1 billion -LRB- $ 836 million <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> -RRB-, it also is the nation's most expensive building. There is enough concrete in it to build 25 replicas of <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION>'s landmark Opera House. Opening it was <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>'s last official function of a three-week tour that was her 11th visit to the country as queen. Huge crowds welcomed her and her husband, Prince <PERSON> Philip </PERSON>. The aborigines turned their backs on the royal couple and sat down en masse. During the queen's inspection of an honor guard, a 3-year-old aboriginal girl left the crowd and thrust a bouquet of flowers into her hands. She accepted the flowers, wrapped in aboriginal ribbons of black, red and gold, but did not speak to the girl, <PERSON> Zena </PERSON> <PERSON> Wickes </PERSON>. In dedicating the bulding, the queen said: `` I rather doubt that the founding fathers of the Australian federation could have foreseen that their work would be crowned by such a confident expression of <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s faith in parliamentary democracy.'' <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> paid tribute to <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s indigenous people in his speech, noting that they had lived in the area for 21,000 years. The aboriginal word `` canberra'' means meeting place. The new <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> has 4,500 rooms, public galleries seating 1,000 people, kitchens capable of producing 8,000 meals a day and parking space for more than 2,000 vehicles. The old building, half a mile away, is to become a museum.

 Rival militias fought hand-to-hand Monday for control of Shiite slums and rained shells on each other's positions in the grim shantytowns despite Syrian army orders to stop the four days of carnage Police said 65 people were killed and 150 wounded Monday, bringing total casualties in the <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> territorial war to 154 dead and 367 wounded. The thunder of shellfire rolled over the city all day and into the night. Gunmen atop racing ambulances fired into the air to clear traffic so the wounded could reach hospitals. Radio stations appealed for blood donations. Doctors confirmed allegations by both sides that wounded fighters were dragged from ambulances and hospitals and slaughtered by their rivals. Fighting began Friday between the moderate militia Amal, which means <PERSON> Hope </PERSON> and has <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s backing, and the radical, pro-Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> has 25,000 soldiers in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, about 7,500 in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. It is the main power broker after 13 years of civil war but is being challenged by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, which the Syrians support in its 8-year-old war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. The battle for control of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s southern slums, where an estimated 250,000 Shiites live, raised fears about the fate of 18 foreign hostages. They include nine Americans and most are believed held by Hezbollah-affiliated kidnappers in the 16-square-mile Shiite enclave. Late Monday, six committees, each grouping a Syrian officer, an Iranian Embassy official, a representative of Amal and one from <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, were formed and charged with enforcing a cease-fire. Fighting eased as the committees drove into the slums, but sporadic bursts of cannon and machine-gun fire echoed in the region well into the night. <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 1.2 million Shiites are its largest sect. With <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s blessing, <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> crushed <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> last month in predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> The four-day battle cost 62 lives and 150 people were wounded. Among Monday's victims were three Amal militiamen killed with axes. Their bodies were taken to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. Officials there said it was full to capacity and could not handle more casualties. An Amal spokesman said privately the three `` were axed to death after they were taken prisoner by <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>.'' Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Ghazi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenaan </PERSON>, Syrian military intelligence chief in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, said he told both factions to stop fighting. `` It is impermissible to let the current state of affairs continue,'' he told reporters after meetings with government, religious and militia leaders. Asked whether Syrian troops would intervene, he said: `` We hope it wo n't come to that, but we shall not allow the bloodshed to continue.'' <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> moved 7,500 soldiers into Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in February 1987 to end a monthslong power struggle between Amal, led by Justice Minister <PERSON> Nabih </PERSON> <PERSON> Berri </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON>'s Druse militia. Senior Moslem clerics urged <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> to repeat in the southern slums `` the successful west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> experiment of the past year.'' Gun battles were reported in al-Sahel Hospital. A doctor said some militiamen forced surgeons at gunpoint to operate on dead comrades `` to bring them to life.'' An <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> employee said: `` We take only victims needing emergency surgery, then send them to recuperate'' at inadequately equipped clinics in Druse-held mountains outside <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Police said <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> fighters, wearing red headbands, appeared to have gained ground Monday in the densely populated <PERSON> Ghobeiri </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Bir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> el-Abed </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Hay </PERSON> <PERSON> Madi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mesharafieh </PERSON> districts. <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION>'s fighters, whose headbands are green or black, control most of Haret Hreik, Mreiji, <PERSON> Roweiss </PERSON>, <PERSON> Shiyah </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kasskass </PERSON>, a police spokesman said. `` <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> has established control over half of the slums,'' he said. `` It only controlled one-third before the current fighting.'' The spokesman, whose name can not be used because of regulations, said <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> had an advantage because it and the Syrians control entrances to the slums. `` This is <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION>'s trump card,'' he said. `` It can move in supplies and reinforcements from several other areas at will, while <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> can not get a fly in or out.'' An Amal fighter in the <LOCATION> Shiyah </LOCATION> district, <PERSON> Tarek </PERSON> <PERSON> Saad </PERSON>, aimed his shoulder-fired rocket launcher toward <PERSON> Hay </PERSON> <PERSON> Madi </PERSON> and said to reporters: `` God willing, we will liberate <PERSON> Hay </PERSON> <PERSON> Madi </PERSON> and Bir el-Abed and free all the foreign hostages. We know they are imprisoned there.'' There has been no word on the hostages since the fighting began. Police said about half the slum residents had fled to west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, camping on sidewalks or taking refuge in mosques, sports stadiums or schools. <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Kurdi </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> photo technician, was trapped with his wife and six children Friday in a shelter in <LOCATION> Bir </LOCATION> <LOCATION> el-Abed </LOCATION>, but escaped Monday. `` Shells rained nonstop around us,'' he said. `` Kids screamed and there was no way to comfort them or feed them.'' When fighting abated for a short time Monday, <PERSON> Kurdi </PERSON> said, `` I told my wife ` This is our chance to get out.' We did, dodging sniper fire as we ran out of Bir el-Abed.''

 Leftist rebels led by a defrocked <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> priest on Monday freed 11 people they kidnapped last week to publicize guerrilla attempts to drive foreign oil companies out of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. The victims were a West German, three Swiss, a Frenchman, a Mexican and five Colombians. All were in good shape, said a police source, speaking on condition of anonymity. A total of 17 people were kidnapped from May 3-5 by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, a pro-Cuban guerrilla group. The rebels released two Colombians last Friday. A West german and three Colombians are still held captive. <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Luecker </PERSON>, the West German honorary consul in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, said in an interview with the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> radio chain <ORGANIZATION> RCN </ORGANIZATION> that he was kidnapped in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> on May 3 by men posing as construction workers. `` They had blocked the street with a wooden barrier, and I had to stop my car,'' he said. `` They showed me their guns and said right from the first that it was a political kidnapping and that I had no reason to fear for my life.'' <PERSON> Luecker </PERSON> said he was well treated during his captivity. He said his captors talked with him about what they said was the need to nationalize foreign oil operations and about right-wing death squads. The death squads have been blamed for killing an estimated 800 people in the last two years. <PERSON> Luecker </PERSON> was released in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> along with two <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> reporters held with him. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> said in a communique last week that it kidnapped the people to draw attention to its campaign against foreign oil companies. The government has exploration and production contracts with more than two dozen foreign oil companies. Guerrillas of the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> have attacked oil company camps and repeatedly bombed <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s main oil pipeline. The guerrilla group is run by a former priest, <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>.

 More than 2,500 government troops Monday fought a gun battle with extremists inside <LOCATION> Sikhism </LOCATION>'s holiest shrine and sealed off the temple. Police said at least five people were killed and five others wounded. Witnesses said the fighting continued late Monday. Militants began shooting from the <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> after they spotted officers inspecting their positions from outside the temple. Security forces fired back with light machine guns, said <PERSON> Baldev </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, superintendent of police in <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION>. Sikh radicals have used the complex as a haven before. In June 1984, the army raided it. More than 1,200 people, mostly Sikhs, were killed. Less than four months later, Prime Minister <PERSON> Indira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> was assassinated by two of her Sikh bodyguards, setting off anti-Sikh riots in which more than 2,000 people were killed. On Monday, <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION> district police chief <PERSON> Suresh </PERSON> <PERSON> Arona </PERSON> said two civilians and three suspected militants were seen lying in and near the shrine. One of the civilians, a woman, identified as <PERSON> Dilip </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaur </PERSON>, an 80-year-old Sikh, later died in a hospital. <PERSON> Venod </PERSON> <PERSON> Kumar </PERSON>, 30, a Hindu who worked with the local <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, was killed when he was caught in the crossfire just outside the main entrance of the temple, police said. Authorities imposed an indefinite curfew on the walled central district of <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION> to keep civilians indoors. Extremists have been fighting since 1982 for a separate Sikh nation in the northern agricultural province of <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>, and thousands of people have been killed. Sikhs make up less than 2 percent of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 800 million people but are a majority in The Sikh religion was founded five centuries ago as an alternative to <LOCATION> Hinduism </LOCATION> and Islam. Sikhs claim Hindus, the vast majority in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, discriminate against them. Also Monday, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported that five people were killed by Sikh extremists in overnight attacks elsewhere in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>. On Saturday, Sikh gunmen killed 13 Hindu migrant workers at a wedding party in neighboring <LOCATION> Haryana </LOCATION> state. At least 941 people have been reported slain so far this year _ more than twice the rate in 1987, when Sikh extremists killed 1,000 people. Most victims were Hindus or moderate Sikhs. A government statement released Monday in <LOCATION> Chandigarh </LOCATION>, capital of <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>, called the shooting from inside the Golden Temple a `` great provocation.'' At the shrine, troopers sealed off exits and kept people from entering. `` We may have to take drastic action against the terrorists. We are watching,'' <PERSON> Arora </PERSON> said. Among Monday's injured was <PERSON> S.S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Virk </PERSON>, deputy inspector-general of the paramilitary <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, authorities said. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Virk </PERSON>, a Sikh, was out of danger after surgery for a bullet wound in the chin. He and other senior security officers had gone to posts on rooftops near the Golden Temple to look at a bunker Sikh militants were building at the western end of the complex, police reported. They said gunfire came from at least 16 points in the temple complex, mainly from Chinese-made AK-47 assault rifles. Violence has increased since <PERSON> Jasbir </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> <PERSON> Rode </PERSON> was made the <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION>'s chief priest early in March. He had been jailed under government anti-terrorism rules but released in an effort by Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, the late leader's son, to placate Sikh extremists and encourage them to negotiate. Since Rode's return, there have been persistent reports that the radicals were building bunkers and firing ports in the complex. <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION> residents said they heard midnight target-practice sessions in the shrine.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was quoted Monday as telling a luncheon guest that <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>'s tell-all book was `` a bunch of falsehoods'' and the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> denounced it as a `` breach of confidence.'' White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> refused to say whether astrology was used to determine the president's schedule, but said first lady <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would continue to consult an astrologer and said `` she has that right.'' As <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>'s new insider account went on sale, syndicated columnist <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON>, who had lunch with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Monday, quoted the president as calling the book by his former chief of staff `` a bunch of falsehoods'' and saying, `` ` I'll be damned if I'll just stand by and let them railroad my wife.''' `` He claims, for example, that Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> never asked him to fire former <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> Director -LRB- <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. -RRB- <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> said of his conversation with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` He says Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> did n't fire <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>. ... He says <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> got ticked off when somebody leaked the story that <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> was going to replace him as chief of staff.'' <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> was ousted as White House chief of staff in early 1987, reportedly at the urging of Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, among others. <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON>, in an interview on <ORGANIZATION> WUSA-TV </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, also said the president told him a three-month period of inactivity following his July 1985 colon cancer surgery `` had nothing to with astrology,'' as maintained in the book. He said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told him Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` was only trying to get <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> to honor what the doctors had put on paper, and said the president could or could n't do. `` He said she was very upset and had said to him that she feared that she had brought all this down on his head, and he had told her, ` No, honey, I brought all this down on your head by taking this job,''' <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as saying. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, meanwhile, repeatedly sidestepped requests to say whether Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s stargazing has had any connection with her husband's public outings. `` Every first lady since <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> has had a role in the presidency,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` and I do n't think anyone denies a role of a wife and her husband. ... But I'm not going to try to characterize any specific responsibilities.'' `` The new book by <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> is a kiss-and-tell story in the mold of all books that seek to exploit the presidency or the first family for personal self-interest,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>'s book, `` For the Record,'' depicted a passive president unduly influenced by his wife on many matters, including the scheduling of public appearances. <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> suggested that Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s interference in scheduling harmed her husband's presidency at times. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> feels `` deep personal disappointment with this breach of confidence.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was quoted by her press secretary as saying, `` I was taken aback by the vengefulness of the attack. It comes through to me that <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> does n't really like me.'' Asked about a weekend White House statement labeling his book as a product of `` vindictiveness and revenge,'' <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> responded in an <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION> interview, `` They ought to know it when they see it.'' White House officials have acknowledged Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s interest in astrology, which it said was heightened in the aftermath of the March 30, 1981, assassination attempt on <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. But the officials never have conceded that astrology was a factor in setting <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s schedule _ as <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> alleges in his book. As some contents of the book became public late last week, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> emphatically denied that astrology played any role in policy decisions. At the conclusion of a Rose Garden ceremony Monday honoring small business executives, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was asked whether astrology played any role in the making of his schedule. `` It ca n't, because it never has,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> quickly told reporters the president had misunderstood the question, and had thought he was being asked the more general question of astrology's role in policy decisions. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s answer, the spokesman said, should be taken as a reiteration of the president's statement of last Friday, in which <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> denied using stargazing in the decision-making process. Earlier, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> was pressed during a news briefing to say whether astrology still plays a role in deciding the president's schedule and public appearances Both <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> and <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Crispen </PERSON>, the first lady's press secretary, said Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will continue to consult with an astrologist, who has been identified as <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> socialite <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quiqley </PERSON>. `` She does n't plan to stop talking to her,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Crispen </PERSON> said. She said these conversations will take place on an `` as-needed basis. ... It's not a daily, weekly, type of thing.'' An administration official, discussing the atmosphere at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on grounds he remain unidentified, said `` I'm not noticing any disruptions'' as a result of the furor over the <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> book. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> denied that the brouhaha was adversely affecting <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s ability to perform. `` The president's management style and his personal methods of leadership and management have been discussed in any number of forums,'' the spokesman said. `` The bottom line is that they work.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>'s predecessor, <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON>, who touched off a furor with his earlier book acknowledging that he had fabricated quotes in <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s name, said Monday he had some qualms about the newest revelations. `` Who's to say his style is n't the best,'' <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> said in a Cable News Network interview. `` He had a good grip on the presidency. He managed it just right and it worked well with one notable exception _ Iran-Contra.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> repeatedly suggested that reporters were blowing the stargazing matter out of proportion. `` Why does every newspaper in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> carry a horoscope? Does every editor and publisher think it's unwieldy? As a personal comfort, millions of people look to astrology,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. The Rev. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON>, a staunch <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> political supporter, expressed dismay over the allegations in the <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> book. `` I'm sincerely hopeful that Mr. <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> was exaggerating or misstating the facts,'' <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON> said in a statement issued by his office. `` As one who believes in God as the creator of the universe, it is incomprehensible to me to think of consulting the stars rather than their maker,'' he said. `` A belief in God and a belief in astrology can not be reconciled.''

 <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s most-wanted military fugitive, cashiered Army Gen. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, came home in handcuffs Monday to face 39 murder charges linked to <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s `` dirty war'' against leftists Extradited by a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, the balding, stocky ex-general arrived aboard a regular flight of <ORGANIZATION> Aerolineas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Argentinas </ORGANIZATION>, the Argentine airline, from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The plane was stopped 300 yards from the airport terminal and <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, dressed in gray slacks, a sweater and white tennis shoes, was removed and placed aboard an armored prisoner-transport vehicle. Escorted by three police cars, an armored car and an ambulance, the ex-general was taken first to <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Headquarters </ORGANIZATION> in downtown <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION>, then removed to a special top-security jail and finally placed in a small cell, reserved for prisoners facing trial, at the somber Federal Court Building. Federal Prosecutor <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> <PERSON> Ocampo </PERSON> said <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, 64, would be held `` in isolation'' there until questioning later this week by federal judges. `` We also have to wait for the official translation of the sentence dictated by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Judge <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> <PERSON> Jensen </PERSON>,'' who ordered <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>'s extradition on April 27 after 15 months of hearings in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> <PERSON> Ocampo </PERSON> said. He said, `` I am going to request a life sentence ... -LRB- the maximum -RRB- and he will be sentenced to life.'' <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> <PERSON> Ocampo </PERSON> predicted the trial could begin `` in late July or the beginning of August.'' <PERSON> Jensen </PERSON> ruled that <PERSON> Suarz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, who fled <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> in 1984 and was arrested by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marshals in January, 1987 in a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francicco </LOCATION> suburb, could be tried in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> on charges of 39 murders, allegedly conducted by troops under his command. <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, supporting its case with 1,600 pages of documents, had sought <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>'s extradition on 43 charges of murder as well as other crimes. He had been accused in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> in 635 separate cases of human rights violations as well as misappropriation of more than $ 2 million in government funds. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> judge rejected four of the murder charges, ruling that identification of the victims was inadequate, approved a charge of forging a passport renewal, and also rejected 23 kidnapping charges, saying the five-year legal deadline for filing the charges had expired in 1984. Under extradition law, <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> can be tried only on charges for which extradition was approved. <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>'s trial had been personally ordered by President <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> shortly after the civilian president took office in December 1983, ending nearly eight years of rightist military rule. The former commander of the Buenos Aires-based 1st <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>, was stripped of rank and pension in April 1984, after being declared `` in rebellion'' for ignoring repeated summonses to appear for questioning in connection with the abduction, torture and murder of suspected leftists in the late 1970s. A government-appointed commission has reported that at least 9,000 Argentines disappeared in the `` dirty war'' against leftist subversives waged by the armed forces regime that seized power in 1976 after ousting former President <PERSON> Isabel </PERSON> <PERSON> Peron </PERSON>. From 1976 to 1978, <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> commanded the <ORGANIZATION> 1st </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>, in whose area more than half of the disappearances took place. Then he was named head of the Joint Chief of Staff. When he retired in 1981, he was named president of the huge state oil monopoly <ORGANIZATION> Yacimientos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroliferos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fiscales </ORGANIZATION>, a post he held until 1982. The misappropriation of government funds charge is linked to <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>'s period as head of the oil company. In other trials ordered by <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>, five former ruling junta members, including two ex-presidents, were convicted in December 1985 of human rights offenses and sentenced to prison terms ranging from life to four years. They now are serving their terms at a military prison. The Argentine <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last May approved a so-called `` law of due obedience,'' which absolved most of the more than 300 military officers from trial on rights abuse charges on grounds that they were following orders from superiors. The law did not absolve high-ranking officers who directed the anti-subversive campaign.

 Ambassador <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> ordered his chartered Panamanian plane to leave a civilian airport and fly to a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> air base because he was concerned for his safety, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. It said <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> made the decision Sunday afternoon when he saw Panamanian security men arguing with his own security detail after the plane landed at the small civilian Paitilla airport. `` It was a judgment call,'' an embassy statement said. `` The ambassador's security detail made the judgment that the -LRB- situation at <LOCATION> Paitilla </LOCATION> -RRB- was not a good environment.'' Maj. <PERSON> Pascual </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Panamanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, called it a hijacking incident. He said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials refused to provide any information about the plane after it landed at <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in the former <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> Canal Zone about five miles from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. It was the second apparent attempt by <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> security to interfere with the ambassador's movements. On April 3, a military vehicle tried to stop his limousine as he left the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> ambassador's residence. Relations between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> have been difficult since the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration began supporting efforts to oust Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> as commander of the Defense Forces and the power behind the civilian government. A federal court in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> indicted <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> in February on drug trafficking charges. After <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had the legislature dismiss President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> on Feb. 26, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> began imposing financial sanctions on <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> had tried to fire the general as military commander the day before. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> still recognizes <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> as president. Banks began cashing checks and permitting withdrawals Monday for the first time in more than two months, with strict limits on the amount to be taken out of an account. No withdrawals had been allowed since March 3, longer at some banks, because of runs on deposits and cash shortages. New rules limit withdrawals from checking accounts to 25 percent of the March 3 balance, to a maximum of $ 10,000. Some banks began taking deposits April 18 and performing some other operations a week later. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, director of the aeronautics board, told a news conference `` procedures'' were required for a civilian aircraft to land at a military base and spend the night there. He said the plane chartered by the embassy group, a six-seat <PERSON> Piper </PERSON>, did not follow them. The embassy statement said `` the ambassador considered it an emergency,'' and ordered the pilot to take off from the civilian airport for nearby <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>. Embassy officials would not say who else was on the plane. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> and his party were returning from a day at the Contadora resort island. According to <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, others on the plane included <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> Galindo </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, son-in-law of <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, who is in hiding in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, and the son of an opposition leader. He said the incident started when airport security personnel saw four `` armed men on the restricted grounds.'' He said airport security questioned them and identified them as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens. `` It was then that the plane landed,'' he said, adding that embassy security men talked to the ambassador on the radio and the plane took off.

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The former fiancee of a sailor carrying the AIDS virus testified Monday that she filed an AIDS-related assault charge against him to protect other women he might date. <PERSON> Jeannine </PERSON> <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON>, 28, said she learned of his test results only one or two days after having sex with Petty Officer 2nd Class <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>. She told the judge and jury at <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>'s court-martial that she worried that he might have sex with someone else without telling them about the test `` What I went through _ what I'm going through _ I do n't want any female to go through,'' <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> said in the first day of <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>'s trial. The AIDS-assault trial is a first of its kind for the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, officials said. <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> also said that since the encounter in April, 1987, she had tested negative three times for HIV antibodies. <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> tested positive in March 1987 for HIV, human immunodeficiency virus, the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Scientists do not know if everyone infected by the virus eventually will develop the incurable ailment, which destroys the body's ability to fight off disease. <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> has said the test result surprised him because he does not consider himself to be in any of the high-risk groups normally associated with AIDS. He could be stripped of rank, dishonorably discharged and sentenced to up to a decade behind bars if found guilty of the charges, which include adultery, or `` wrongfully having sexual intercourse with a married woman, not his wife.'' <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> was separated from her third husband when she was dating <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>. The trial at the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Treasure </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> facility is expected to last three days. The 27-year-old sailor denies the charges, saying that he wore a condom during sex and that <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> knew he had tested positive for the HIV virus. He claims her charges are based on jealousy. <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> testified that she confronted <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> about his test results about a week after she learned about his condition from a mutual friend. `` I asked him why did he take me to bed with him if he knew,'' she said. `` He said ` I'm sorry. I do n't know why.''' <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> said that she told <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> she loved him and wanted to take care of him and that he then proposed to her. However, she said, <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> ended their engagement about two weeks later. <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> was composed as she testified before the judge, Capt. R.M. <PERSON> Mollison </PERSON>, and the seven-member jury. However, she heatedly denied a suggestion that she brought the charge to avenge herself after <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> broke off their brief engagement. <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>, a Magnolia, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, native, lives off-base with another woman, to whom he has been engaged for six months. Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman at the <LOCATION> Treasure </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION>, where the trial is being held, said the case was the first of its kind in the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. An Army private is charged in another AIDS-related assault case, and his court-martial is set to resume on Wednesday in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huachuca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Security Council Condemns Chemical Weapons Use in Iran-Iraq War</HEAD>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> on Monday condemned the use of chemical weapons in the Iran-Iraq war and called on the warring parties to refrain from future use of the outlawed arms. The resolution was passed unanimously by the 15-member council. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has pushed for <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> condemnation of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> for using chemical weapons. Diplomats said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> was displeased that the resolution did not single out <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> later told a news conference the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has evidence that both sides are using chemical weapons. He said the use of chemical weapons and the `` war of the cities'' missile attacks on <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> and other cities complicated <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> efforts to impose sanctions and an arms embargo against <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> for refusing a truce. <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> said the horror of the recent use of chemical weapons underscores the urgency of a negotiated settlement in the 7 -LCB- - year-old war and the need to implement a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> cease-fire resolution The council resolution called on all countries to impose strict controls on the export of chemical-weapons materials to both <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and noted that a <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> protocol of 1925 bans the use of chemical arms. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> sponsored the measure. The meeting was called to discuss Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>'s April 25 report on charges of chemical weapons use by both sides. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> chief sent a physician from <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> to visit both <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and examine victims of chemical attacks. Each side accused the other of using chemical weapons and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> claims <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> killed 5,000 people, mostly Iraqi Kurds, in a chemical attack on the Iranian-held <LOCATION> Halabja </LOCATION> territory of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> did not deny the charge and said it would use all necessary means to repel Iranian forces. It also accused <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> of using chemical weapons. The secretary-general's report did not blame one side or the other, but said evidence existed in both countries of the use of chemical weapons.

<TEXT>
 An earthquake shook <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> shortly before noon Monday, rocking buildings in <LOCATION> Kingston </LOCATION> and sending frightened residents fleeing into the street. There were no reports of deaths and police said only one injury was reported. They said <PERSON> Natalie </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, 14, suffered broken ankles when she jumped in panic from the second floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Rosemount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Linstead </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Catherine </LOCATION>, 40 miles northwest of the capital of <LOCATION> Kingston </LOCATION>. Officials said they had no reports of significant structural damage but the Office of Disaster Preparedness is conducting an island-wide survey of bridges and buildings. The Seismic Research Unit at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indies </ORGANIZATION> recorded the quake at 11:24 a.m. -LRB- EDT -RRB- and said its center was in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> about 75 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Montego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> and 15 miles south of the Cuban communities of <PERSON> Pilon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Portillo </PERSON>. It said the earthquake measured 4.2 degrees on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale. The university said the worst earthquake recorded in <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> was on Jan. 14, 1907, when <LOCATION> Kingston </LOCATION> was virtually destroyed. More than 1,000 people were killed and 9,000 were left homeless. The Richter scale is a gauge of energy released by a quake as recored on seismographs. A tremor registering 4 is capable of causing moderate damage and one with a magnitude of 5 can cause considerable damage. A quake recorded at 7 is considered a major quake.

His weekend visit to <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> was unexpected and was the first by a top <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> official to that communist state. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> the position of the Soviet bloc `` is becoming more and more important in the peace process.'' He met in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> Sunday with Prime Minister <PERSON> Karoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Varkonyi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Janos </PERSON> <PERSON> Berecz </PERSON>, secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. An official at the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said `` it would not be surprising'' for <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> to hold talks with Soviet observers attending the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> meeting. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Guilo </PERSON> <PERSON> Andreotti </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> discussed the <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> situation in a 50-minute meeting at the military airport in <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION>. The two also discussed the Arab uprising in the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. They later met briefly with reporters. <PERSON> Andreotti </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> supports the idea of an international <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace conference. He also said that while <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> maintains friendly ties with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, it supports the Palestinian cause. <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Beilin </PERSON>, director-general of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, accompanied <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Beilin </PERSON> said upon his return to <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> Monday that <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> is interested in expanding its economic ties with the Jewish state. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, along with all other Soviet-bloc countries except <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, cut diplomatic ties with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> following the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. But last year, the two countries established low-level diplomatic relations. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> without elaboration that the <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> party and the Hungarian leaders discussed the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> conflict and <LOCATION> Hungarian-Israeli </LOCATION> ties, including economic issues and tourism. `` I think that this visit, conducted upon <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s initiative, raises our bilateral ties to another level,'' <PERSON> Beilin </PERSON> said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television. But he did not predict a full renewal of diplomatic ties. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> that the visit of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> in June `` is positive for the peace process'' but its significance depends on the outcome of the May 27 summit between President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, head of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s socialist <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, is to leave Wednesday for a working trip to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that will include talks with <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>.

 Gov. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> formally sought federal disaster aid Monday for a community battered by a fuel plant explosion, while a funeral was held for one of two plant executives killed in last week's massive blasts. Classes resume in 11 of the 12 schools damaged Wednesday in the series of thunderous explosions, which are estimated to have caused nearly $ 73 million in damage. The blasts injured 326 people and destroyed nearly 3 million pounds of the ammonium perchlorate oxidizer manufactured for the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s Titan missile program. Company counsel <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Rooker </PERSON> said his firm has been the sole supplier to the Titan rocket program since its inception over 20 years ago and has been the principal supplier to the space shuttle program. <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> asked for a federal disaster declaration in a letter to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> outlining the destruction caused by explosions at the <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Production </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> ammonium perchlorate plant. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, the state director of emergency management, said the estimate included $ 54.5 million in damage to more than 8,000 homes surrounding the plant and $ 17.4 million for the two plants and other businesses. <PERSON> Verne </PERSON> <PERSON> Paule </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, said a disaster declaration might not be warranted because an estimated 90 percent of the damage was covered by private insurance. Seven investigators have been assigned to analyze videotapes and still photographs taken of the explosions along with evidence from the debris, said <ORGANIZATION> Clark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Leinbach </PERSON>. `` Basically we're taking things very gingerly,'' said <PERSON> Leinbach </PERSON>. `` We're concerned about life safety. We want to make sure what we touch and move is the right thing to do.'' A funeral was held Monday for plant manager <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Halker </PERSON>, whose body was found 25 yards from the front entrance to the plant. Another executive, company controller <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Westerfield </PERSON>, was killed, but his body has not been found. Company officials are scheduled to meet with <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> officials sometime this week in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, where they will seek emergency help in rebuilding the plant at a site outside the <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. A second ammonium perchlorate plant remained closed Monday while its owners, the <ORGANIZATION> Kerr-McGee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, wait to see what caused the Pacific Engineering explosions. The plant, the only other in the country to produce the chemical, is about a mile from the demolished plant.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Monday ruled out the possibility of pardons before trial for any of the defendants in the Iran-Contra case, according to a columnist who had lunch with the president. In addition, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he may not have to `` face that issue'' at all if the trial is n't concluded before his term ends, syndicated columnist <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> said. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> has said the president has refused to discuss the issue of pardons in the past. <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> reported on the president's comments during an interview on <ORGANIZATION> WUSA-TV </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Monday evening. The president said he `` did n't believe in giving pardons before people are convicted of anything,'' <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> related, adding that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> reasoned `` it leaves the cloud of guilt on through the years.'' <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> noted that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> left the door open for pardons after the trial, but given the delays in the start of the trial, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, `` I wo n't have to face that issue.'' At issue is whether <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will consider either pretrial or post-trial pardons of his former national security adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> staffer, retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Maj.

The four are charged with conspiring to illegally divert profits from the U.S.-Iran arms sales to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said last month: `` I have raised the issue with the president four or five times myself. I've heard it raised by others, and every time the president says the same thing which is, ` I'm not discussing pardons.''' White House chief of staff <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> has said, `` I think the president made it abundantly clear that he expects the legal process to run its course.''

 A federal jury Monday found four members of a polygamist clan guilty of 20 of 23 counts stemming from the bombing of a Mormon chapel and 13-day standoff with police that left a corrections official dead. The jury, deliberating 25 hours over four days, found clan matriarch <PERSON> Vickie </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON> innocent of one count of attempted murder of <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents and two firearms charges, including possession of a sawed-off shotgun. She was convicted on five counts. On the charges of attempted murder against the other three, the jury returned guilty verdicts in the second-degree, meaning the panel did not find the crimes premeditated. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> scheduled sentencing July 1. The siege at the clan's farm in <LOCATION> Marion </LOCATION> by 100 lawmen ended in a shootout Jan. 28 that killed state Corrections Lt. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> House </PERSON> and injured clan leader <PERSON> Addam </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON>. <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON>, 27, was found guilty of maliciously damaging the church building; attempting to kill <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents; assaulting, resisting, impeding, intimidating and interfering with federal agents; and possession of an unregistered bomb. He also was found guilty of a corollary charge of use of a bomb on the malicious damage count and two counts of use of a firearm linked to the assault and attempted murder charges. The jury found Mrs. Singer, 45, guilty of the same charges, with the exception of the attempted murder charge and the corollary firearms charge. <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON>, 21, and Mrs. Singer's son, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON>, 21, were found guilty of assault-resistance and attempted murder charges and the two accompanying firearms counts. `` We've already won the victory!'' <PERSON> Addam </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON> shouted to reporters as he was led into court. But there was little discernible reaction when the verdicts were read. `` We were very pleased and satisfied,'' said Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lambert </PERSON>. The maximum penalty for attempting to kill federal agents is 20 years, 10 years for bombing the chapel. The corollary firearms and use-of-a-bomb charges carry minimum-mandatory five-year penalties. Assaulting federal agents and possession of a bomb each carry maximum 10-year prison terms. Jury deliberations began Wednesday afternoon. Prosecutors called 67 witnesses, while the defense called only three witnesses, including the buckskin-clad <PERSON> Addam </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON>, who tearfully and defiantly defended the clan's actions. <PERSON> Addam </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON> admitted he bombed the <ORGANIZATION> Kamas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> on Jan. 16 with 87 sticks of dynamite, but insisted he never fired at any of the authorities who surrounded the 2 -LCB- - acre farm in a standoff often punctuated with gunfire No charges have been filed in <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s death, which authorities have linked to the wheelchair-bound <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON>. But Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> Creighton </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said his office intends next week to file state murder charges against an unspecified number of the defendants. The government's final word in the case came Wednesday as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> denounced the clan as `` a band of outlaws'' who committed the crimes in the name of religion. `` Trust in the Lord but pass me my M-1 rifle,'' <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said of <LOCATION> Addam </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Swapp </LOCATION>. While admitting that Mrs. Singer my not have directly participated in crimes, prosecutors charged her with the most counts, alleging her aiding and abetting of family members made her just as culpable. `` She was n't exactly sitting back in a rocking chair in her bedroom crocheting and reading Scriptures,'' <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said. Clan members maintained the bombing and standoff were ordered by <PERSON> God </PERSON> as a sign of the impending collapse of church, state and nation, but also were intended to draw attention to the 1979 slaying of polygamist patriarch <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON>, Mrs. Singer's husband and <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON>'s father-in-law. Singer was shot following an 18-day standoff at the same farm by authorities trying to arrest him on warrants stemming from his refusal to send his children to public schools and his defiance of a court order that he relinquish the children of his second wife to their father. The family contended Singer was murdered in a `` church-state conspiracy.'' `` I guess you could say it started back in 1973 when <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON> took his children out of public schools,'' Addam Swapp testified.

 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> began a tour of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s poorest country Monday with an appeal to its people `` not to lose hope.'' `` I will spend five days among you, sharing your aspirations, seeing first-hand this nation stricken by poverty and a lack of development and resources,'' he said in an arrival speech at the <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paz </LOCATION> <LOCATION> airport </LOCATION>, which is 13,150 feet above sea level and ringed by snow-capped Andean peaks. President <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> <PERSON> Estenssoro </PERSON> said in a welcoming speech the visit would help bolster the flagging spirits of Bolivians. `` You come at a time when <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> is suffering bitter tests that could weaken its spirit or perhaps sink it into a state of desperation,'' the 80-year-old president said. He said technological and scientific advances had heightened aspirations of the Third World without providing the means to fulfill them. `` The <LOCATION> Bolivian </LOCATION> people have perhaps been more harshly punished than most in this respect,'' he said, Thousands of people, including many peasants in colorful Indian dress and traditional bowler hats, greeted the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> leader at the airport. He arrived from <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> on a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 of the state airline <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aereo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boliviano </ORGANIZATION> at 5:16 p.m. The pontiff, a skier, spoke in a strong voice and showed no outward signs of being affected by altitude sickness, which Bolivians call `` sorocche.'' <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> is the world's highest capital and the altitude makes many visitors uncomfortable, if not ill. However, in a meeting with <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>'s 39 bishops at the end of the day, the pope seemed to be wearying. Bishop <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Terrazas </PERSON>, head of the local episcopal conference, did not deliver a prepared speech to the pontiff because `` we see that the pope is tired.'' `` I believe these words have no place right now because of the weariness that your first day here has caused to the Holy Father,'' <PERSON> Terrazas </PERSON> said to the pope. He instead handed the pope a copy of the speech. In the text of <PERSON> Terrazas </PERSON>' speech, he told the pope <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> suffers from `` a situation of injustice that consumes thousands of brothers in degrading misery and inhumane unemployment. To this are added other ills such as delinquency, immorality and drug trafficking and other social calamaities that constitute a devastating scourge to the very being of our people.'' The pope was spending the night in the papal nuncio's residence. Dealers in compressed oxygen said church officials rented several tanks and face-masks for use if needed by the papal entourage. To review the military honor guard and groups of white-smocked schoolgirls at the airport, the pope rode in a green army jeep rather than taking the long walk. From the airport the papal caravan descended to <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paz </LOCATION>, which is 11,930 feet above the sea in a mountain ravine. The vehicles moved down a cliffside highway that was lined by tens of thousands of people. Crowds cheered and waved banners of yellow and white, the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> colors, and the yellow, red and green Bolivian flag. Peasant shacks perched precariously on the mountainsides were brilliant white, freshly painted by their owners. The city government offered special tax incentives to those who painted their homes. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, standing in the glass booth of the popemobile, traveled 11 miles through the city center to the papal nuncio's residence, where he is staying He will spend five days in <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, the second and longest stop on his four-nation tour, which began Friday in <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> and will include visits to <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>. He returns to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> on May 18. The pontiff will visit seven Bolivian cities ranging from the tin mining center of <LOCATION> Oruro </LOCATION>, devastated by mine closures, to the lowland boom town of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION>, a center of cattle ranching, agriculture and cocaine trafficking. Government austerity measures eliminated an annual inflation rate of 20,000 percent in <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, but they caused serious labor unrest because of mass layoffs. The country is also a major source of coca leaves, the raw material for cocaine. This visit is the <PERSON> pope </PERSON>'s tour ninth to <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> since he became head of the 860-million-member <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> nearly 10 years ago. He has made 37 pilgrimages abroad from the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> is scheduled to spend his 68th birthday in <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> on May 18.

 A retired state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> justice violated rules of judicial misconduct for abusing his power to help a female friend who was then an assistant judge, a board said in a report issued Monday. The state <ORGANIZATION> Judicial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conduct </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> found Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> in violation of codes governing conduct on five of 11 counts after members disagreed on the nature of <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>'s relationship with <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Wheel </PERSON>. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Marks </PERSON>, one of <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>'s lawyers, said Monday that he would ask the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, which is the final judge of <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>'s conduct, to overturn the findings by the seven-member conduct board The board said in a report to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> that `` serious violations of the Code of Judicial Conduct were committed by Justice Hill'' and found `` the entire judicial system is still suffering from the fallout of his misconduct.'' The board made no specific recommendation of discipline, leaving it up to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to determine whether <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> should be reprimanded or forbidden from coming out of retirement to hear cases. <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, who turns 71 on Tuesday, retired from the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> last year, a few months after the misconduct charges were filed in January 1987 against him and two other justices. The charges against Justice <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> were dropped and Justice <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> died. Meanwhile, the scandal worsened a backlog in the state's highest court, as the justices refused Gov. <PERSON> Madeleine </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunin </PERSON>'s request that they step aside, and instead disqualified themselves from hundreds of cases involving people connected with their case. All three justices were originally accused of improperly using their clout on the court to advance the interests of Wheel, who was then an assistant judge in <LOCATION> Chittenden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. A court employee testified that Wheel had been seen with her arms around <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, but <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wheel </PERSON> testified they were not close and did not have an affair. <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> described the relationship as collegial. The <ORGANIZATION> Judicial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conduct </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> ruled that <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> presided over cases involving Wheel when he should not have and that he improperly helped her. The board found <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> innocent of many of the misconduct charges dealing directly with the Wheel relationship, but two members filed a dissent arguing that a significant relationship did exist. Marks said his interpretation was that the board felt there was an appearance of wrongdoing but no real wrongdoing. Wheel, who lost her re-election bid in 1986, has been convicted in a separate criminal case stemming from allegations that she billed the state for days she did not work. She has yet to be sentenced.

 Democrat <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> urged <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginians </LOCATION> on Monday to vote for him in Tuesday's presidential primary, acknowledging his uphill fight and saying `` I've always fought against the odds.'' `` The race is tight,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told a park rally of more than 1,500 people. `` I'm coming to the last lap. I'm running longer and running stronger because my mind is made up. We've come too far. We've got to go on now. Press on! Press on! Press on!'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, whose presidential hopes have dimmed with landslide losses in recent primaries, said he would not give up his candidacy. `` I've always fought againt the odds. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has 39 percent and I have 29 percent,'' he said of cumulative popular votes won by both candidates. An <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> tabulation gives front-runner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> 37 percent of the primary vote won to date and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> 28 percent. `` We're within striking distance. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, you can make a difference. We're winning every day, and when I win, you win,'' he said. At several stops in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> tailored his talk to the economically depressed region. He called <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> a `` state of extremes _ good minds, reduced opportunity.'' `` Rich soil and poor people. Brilliant minds. Something has gone awry,'' he said. `` I call for fairness. Fair wages for workers, fair prices for farmers. Fair taxes for the rich and the powerful. I call for fairness.'' After an overnight stay at the <PERSON> Arnett </PERSON> home of an unemployed coal miner and an early morning stop at <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s No. 7 mine to greet miners at shift-change, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> took a drive along winding one-lane roads to visit the <ORGANIZATION> Minden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, located not far from an abandoned <ORGANIZATION> PCB </ORGANIZATION> dump that the federal <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> estimates will cost $ 21 million to clean up. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said the dump is an example of the `` economic and environmental violence'' that government _ particularly the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration _ has imposed upon poorer citizens. `` You can understand poverty in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> ... where it has n't rained in 15 years,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said `` Here we are in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> ... in the richest country in the world, with talented people, rich soil, and yet poverty abounds.'' `` The state is not poor; its wealth is not getting to the people.'' Later, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, which also holds its primary on Tuesday. At an airport news conference in <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, he told reporters: `` I do n't take <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> voters for granted. This is a live race.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was upbeat despite polls indicating he trails <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in the state. `` I'm here working,'' he said. `` I'm not just here by ... commercials, I'm here in person.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> made stops at a park in downtown <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION> and walked through a mostly black housing project. At the housing project, he declared: `` Every vote counts, every voter counts.'' Monday's visit was <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s second to <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, and his extra time in the state could help him at the polls Tuesday. The Democratic candidate who spends the most time in <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> traditionally does well in the presidential primary in the mostly Republican state. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> insisted he could still win the battle for the nomination. `` I have the longest legs, the strongest legs ... As the days get longer, the race gets stronger,'' he said.

 `` The Phantom of the Opera'' received 10 Tony award nominations Monday, but none for its leading lady, <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Brightman </PERSON>, who is married to <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Webber </PERSON>, the composer and co-producer of the show. It was <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Webber </PERSON> who waged a fight with Actors Equity to bring his wife to Broadway in the musical, which is a lavish retelling of the <PERSON> Gaston </PERSON> <PERSON> Leroux </PERSON> novel about a deformed composer and his love for a beautiful soprano in the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> Opera. The American actors union twice refused permission for <PERSON> Brightman </PERSON> to appear in the show in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, but it relented after `` Phantom'' producers agreed to employ an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> actor in a major role in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> within the next three years. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>, <PERSON> Brightman </PERSON>'s co-star, received a Tony nomination as did <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaye </PERSON>, who plays the actress' operatic rival in `` Phantom.'' The production, which won a best musical nomination, also was nominated for score, <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Webber </PERSON>, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stilgoe </PERSON>; director, <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Prince </PERSON>; book, <PERSON> Stilgoe </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Webber </PERSON>; scenic design, <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Bjornson </PERSON>; costume design, <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Bjornson </PERSON>; lighting design, <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Bridge </PERSON>; and choreography, <LOCATION> Lar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lubovitch </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Brightman </PERSON> was not the only musical star to be passed over for a nomination. <PERSON> Bernadette </PERSON> <PERSON> Peters </PERSON> failed to receive a nod for her performance in `` Into the Woods.'' In other acting categories, several big stars were snubbed. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Malkovich </PERSON> was not nominated for his performance in <PERSON> Lanford </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s `` Burn This'' and neither did <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Plummer </PERSON> for his role in `` Macbeth. Both their co-stars, <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> in `` Burn This'' and <PERSON> Glenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in `` Macbeth,'' received best actress nominations. Also absent from the list of nominees was <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON>, whose highly publicized debut in <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Mamet </PERSON>'s `` Speed-the-Plow'' took place last week. The best actress in a musical nominations went to <PERSON> Patti </PERSON> <PERSON> LuPone </PERSON> of `` Anything Goes''; <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuhn </PERSON> of `` Chess''; <PERSON> Joanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Gleason </PERSON> of `` Into the Woods'' and <PERSON> Alison </PERSON> <PERSON> Fraser </PERSON> of `` Romance-Romance.''

<TEXT>
 Foreign Minister <PERSON> Roelof </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> is to meet Angolan officials this week in a high-level follow-up to last week's ground-breaking peace talks, the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> reported Monday. The talks will be held Thursday and Friday in <LOCATION> Brazzaville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Congo </LOCATION>, according to official sources quoted by the agency. It said Defense Minister <PERSON> Magnus </PERSON> <PERSON> Malan </PERSON> may accompany <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said arrangements for the next round of talks with <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> were not complete, but said <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> `` is not opposed to <LOCATION> Brazzaville </LOCATION> as a venue.'' The <ORGANIZATION> SAPA </ORGANIZATION> report said the <LOCATION> Brazzaville </LOCATION> talks would not involve the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Last week, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> met in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> for their first head-to-head talks on the withdrawal of foreign troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and on the related topic of independence for <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, also known as <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. One of <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s subordinates headed the South African delegation in the U.S.-brokered discussions. South African soldiers are fighting in support of the 13-year-old rebel movement against <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s Marxist government, which is backed by Soviet advisers and an estimated 40,000 Cuban troops. Earlier Monday, the U.S.-backed Angolan rebels reported killing 64 Angolan soldiers and eight Cubans and shooting down three Soviet-built aircraft in attacks last week. Rebel casualties were listed as 12 killed, 10 wounded, two missing. The rebel organization <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION>, standing for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> for the Total Independence of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, made the claims in a statement distributed in <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> is a former Portuguese African colony. There was no independent confirmation of <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION>'s claims. <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> said it killed seven Cubans in a May 2 attack on a wood-processing plant near <LOCATION> Conde </LOCATION> in the northwestern Angolan enclave of <LOCATION> Cabinda </LOCATION>. It said 64 Angolan soldiers were also killed in actions across six provinces last week. The rebels also said that the Cuban pilot died and and two village children were killed by falling wreckage when rebel anti-aircraft batteries shot down a MiG-21 plane Thursday as it bombed <LOCATION> Kanamba </LOCATION> in southeastern <LOCATION> Moxico </LOCATION> province. The statement said two MI-17 helicopters were shot down on Wednesday in the area. <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> said violence in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> would keep up and increase until <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s Marxist government, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> agreed to negotiate an end to the civil war. The rebels were not included in the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> talks.

 <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, a scourge of school bureaucrats, teacher unions and slipshod standards during 3 -LCB- years as secretary of education, said Monday he will resign his <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> post in mid-September to return to private life. The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> made the announcement after <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> met privately with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> at the White House and then informed his senior staff of his departure plans. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> told the staff he had recommended that <PERSON> Linus </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, the undersecretary of education and a former superintendent of schools in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, succeed him. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> told education reporters last month he probably would not stay for the final few months of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. In somewhat uncharacteristic fashion, he refused to take calls from reporters Monday to discuss his plans, which include hitting the lecture circuit and writing a book spelling out his vision for improving <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s schools and colleges. His spokesman, <PERSON> Loye </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, read this terse statement: `` Secretary <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> met today with the president and subsequently with <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> staff to say that he intends to leave his position in mid-September. He expressed his gratitude to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for the opportunity to serve in his Cabinet. The secretary reiterated to his staff his intention to continue at ` full speed ahead' during the next few months.'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> plans to issue two new reports on a model elementary school curriculum and on improving colleges before he steps down, said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Kristol </PERSON>, his chief of staff. The college book will try `` to shed some light on the black box of higher education'' with practical advice for parents, policy-makers and others, he said. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> made headlines throughout his tenure with acerbic criticisms of teacher unions, the `` blob'' of school bureaucracy, the `` greed'' of colleges raising tuitions twice as fast as inflation, and the `` <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Crow </PERSON> math and back-of-the-bus science'' meted out to black children in ghetto schools. He called <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s schools the nation's worst and said that system was in an `` educational meltdown. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement Monday that it wishes <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> well and and expressed hope that the next secretary of education `` will use the power of the office to be a positive force in support of public education.'' `` The nation needs a secretary of education who will work cooperatively with parents, teachers, school administrators, college faculty and the community at large,'' the <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION> statement said. Two weeks ago, in a report called, `` American Education: Making It Work,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> warned that the public has little to show for five years of school reform. The schools are `` slightly improved,'' he said, but `` we are certainly not doing well enough, and we are not doing well enough fast enough.'' He called for using the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military to wage war against drug traffickers, and quarreled with the surgeon general over what to teach children about AIDS and condoms. His penchant for controversy was evident from his first news conference in 1985, when he suggested that college students cope with aid cuts through `` stereo divestiture, automobile divestiture, three-weeks-at-the-beach divestiture.'' The remark drew howls from outraged college administrators _ and tongue-in-cheek ripostes from collegians on spring break in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, 44, championed what he called `` the three C's'' of education: choice, character and content He failed to convince <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to offer poor parents vouchers to buy remedial education at either public or private schools. But his criticism of bilingual education led <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to ease restrictions on aid for English-immersion programs. He argued strenuously that teachers had a duty to impart strong morals to their students. And, as with his attack on `` <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Crow </PERSON> math,'' he insisted that tough, unyielding standards _ such as those he outlined in a model curriculum called `` <ORGANIZATION> James </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Madison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>'' _ were essential for all children. He said the civil rights challenge of the 1990s was to `` ensure equal intellectual opportunity'' in school. He was an unapologetic defender of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> efforts to slash the federal education budget, arguing that more money did not guarantee better results and that state and local school budgets were rising inexorably anyway. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> has been a peripatetic Cabinet officer, visiting nearly 100 elementary and secondary schools. He has also proven a big draw as an after-dinner speaker on the Republican fund-raising circuit. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, who switched from the Democratic to the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> two years ago, has spoken at 63 <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> functions in the past three years, according to the trade publication Education Week. There has been speculation that <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> may eventually run for office, possibly from his adopted state of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>.

 A judge Monday ordered the wife of former <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opera </ORGANIZATION> director Sir <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Bing </PERSON> to relinquish control over his movements for six hours a day so he can rest and nurses may care for him. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> <PERSON> Beauchamp </PERSON> <PERSON> Ciparick </PERSON>, a trial-level judge, also directed that male nurses be hired to care for <PERSON> Bing </PERSON> to assuage <PERSON> Lady </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglass </PERSON> <PERSON> Bing </PERSON>'s apparent jealousy of female nurses. Mrs. <PERSON> Ciparick </PERSON> ordered <PERSON> Lady </PERSON> <PERSON> Bing </PERSON> ` to stay away from her husband from 10 a.m. until noon for his nutrition and hygiene needs, from 3:30 p.m. until 6:30 p.m. so he can nap, and from 9 p.m. until 10 p.m. for further care. After 10 p.m., she may stay with <PERSON> Bing </PERSON> until 10 a.m. the next day, the judge ruled, and if <PERSON> Bing </PERSON> has to see a doctor, his wife may not go with him. `` I'm not convinced that you are such a danger that you have to be restricted altogether,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Ciparick </PERSON> told <PERSON> Lady </PERSON> <PERSON> Bing </PERSON>. The judge's ruling was an interim measure taken during a hearing on a request by <PERSON> Bing </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldhamer </PERSON>, to bar <PERSON> Lady </PERSON> <PERSON> Bing </PERSON> from her husband's apartment. The hearing will continue Monday. <PERSON> Goldhamer </PERSON>, who maintains <PERSON> Lady </PERSON> <PERSON> Bing </PERSON> is dangerous to her husband, charges that <PERSON> Lady </PERSON> <PERSON> Bing </PERSON> has abused her husband verbally and physically. The lawyer has also asked Mrs. <PERSON> Ciparick </PERSON> to annul the Bings' marriage. He says the former Met impresario has Alzheimer's disease and did not know what he was doing when he married <PERSON> Lady </PERSON> <PERSON> Bing </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, on Jan. 9, 1987 <PERSON> Lady </PERSON> <PERSON> Bing </PERSON>, a former mental patient, frequently disrupted the hearing which has been underway since Thursday. She has yelled that witnesses were lying and she has tried to get <PERSON> Bing </PERSON> to leave the proceedings with her.

<HEAD>Glasnost Debated At IPI Meeting Attended by Soviets</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Soviet journalists debated the meaning and the future of glasnost with their Western colleagues Monday at the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>'s annual meeting. This was the first IPI general assembly attended by Soviet and Chinese representatives. About 400 publishers and editors from 43 countries are taking part in the <ORGANIZATION> IPI </ORGANIZATION> assembly. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Pumpyansky </PERSON>, editor in chief of the Soviet weekly <PERSON> Novoe </PERSON> <PERSON> Vremia </PERSON>, described Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of glasnost _ or greater openness on certain issues in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> society _ as realism, `` seeing the world as it is, not in ideological dogmas.'' Delegates laughed and applauded when he added, `` It is like in the fairy tale when the little child says the king has no clothes... or badly dressed if dressed in a Soviet suit. <PERSON> Conor </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruise </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Dublin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> said forces exist in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> that want to reduce the substance of glasnost. He said the policy would have a better chance for success if confined to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Developments in other <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact countries could prove to be the `` Achilles heel'' of glasnost, letting loose revolutionary forces, <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> stated. `` There are ominous signs in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Pierro </PERSON> <PERSON> Ottone </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Repubblica </ORGANIZATION> said glasnost should be viewed as the instrument of a power struggle in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> as a new class wants to get rid of the old mentality in search of a pragmatic solution to Soviet problems. `` There could be unpredictable consequences of this struggle,'' <PERSON> Ottone </PERSON> said. He said it could let loose tensions not only in the other <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact countries but in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> as well, citing recent Armenian unrest as an example. In Monday's opening ceremony of the general assembly, <ORGANIZATION> IPI </ORGANIZATION> officials demanded a lifting of restrictions on the press in <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> IPI </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Galliner </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> had made significant progress in restoring democracy since the return to civilian rule in 1983. But he said a constant threat to the news media exists from legislation providing for prosecution and imprisonment of journalists and hefty fines for publications deemed pornographic. The publishers and editors of two men's magazines, <LOCATION> Playboy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bravo </LOCATION>, were fined a total of $ 750,000 on Dec. 10 The fines have not yet been paid, and the government has announced plans for legislation to substantially reduce the fines. <PERSON> Galliner </PERSON> also noted that state-produced newsprint prices have gone up 200 percent in the past 16 months. He and <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Cebrian </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> IPI </ORGANIZATION> board chairman, appealed for an amnesty for political prisoners jailed during military rule in <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> and an end to prosecution of journalists for what they write. The <ORGANIZATION> IPI </ORGANIZATION>, an independent organization with offices in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, represents 2,000 publishers and editors in more than 60 countries and is dedicated to defending press freedom. The Turkish military took over in 1980, following widespread political violence which claimed 5,000 lives in the three years prior to the coup. The generals relinquished power after 1983 general elections won by the <ORGANIZATION> Motherland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> of Premier <PERSON> Turgut </PERSON> <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON>. Since return to civilian rule, no journalists have been imprisoned but several are on trial on charges of insulting the president or the premier or dealing with taboo subjects such as the problem of the Kurdish minority. <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> defended his pricing policies, saying state subsidies, including those on newsprint, were lifted as part of his program to establish a free-market economy in <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. He conceded that a chief function of the press is criticism of the government but complained that `` a pervasive pessimism'' is spreading through the society because of too much negative news. <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON>, without citing specific examples, told the delegates that in <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> `` people are shying away from a political career'' because of invasion of privacy. The premier recommended a peaceful approach in covering foreign news so not to fan hostilities among nations, especially with neighbors. On the agenda for the three-day meeting are, among other topics, problems on reporting from Islamic countries, protection of privacy and the future of <ORGANIZATION> UNESCO </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 A convicted murderer who escaped from the state prison was nabbed 25 miles away Monday after he spent more than a month living in the woods, surviving on a diet that included a groundhog, state police said. <PERSON> Tommie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mollohan </PERSON>, who was serving a life term for the robbery and murder of a Brounland grocer in 1973, was captured in a remote wooded area near <LOCATION> Cameron </LOCATION>, said state police Trooper S.P. <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mollohan </PERSON> had remained at large since he escaped with two other murderers from the maximum security unit April 3. A resident had reported seeing <PERSON> Mollohan </PERSON> Sunday night and he was spotted during a search Monday morning. Local police, state conservation officers and authorities with tracking dogs joined the pursuit as searchers chased <PERSON> Mollohan </PERSON> up one thickly wooded ridge and down another before capturing him. The escapee had been carrying a dismantled .22 - caliber rifle in a garbage bag but ditched it during the pursuit, <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> <PERSON> Mollohan </PERSON> was carrying only a chocolate syrup bottle, hanging from his neck on a string, as a water canteen when he was apprehended, the trooper said. Authorities said he spent the time living in the woods on abandoned farm land. `` He showed us some places where he stayed _ one of them was a lean-to. But mostly he slept under the stars. He said he caught him a groundhog once, and he said he found some eggs that he ate,'' <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> said. The prisoner weighed about 230 pounds when he escaped, and lost between 45 and 65 pounds while on the lam, <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mollohan </PERSON> faces administrative escape charges through the prison's internal disciplinary system, said <PERSON> Jerrie </PERSON> <PERSON> Clutter </PERSON>, secretary to Warden <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hedrick </PERSON>. Criminal escape charges probably will be dropped in view of his life sentence, <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> said. Penitentiary officials described <PERSON> Mollohan </PERSON>, 45, as the mastermind of the breakout by the three escapees, all of whom were serving life sentences without chance of parole. <PERSON> Escapee </PERSON> <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Stacy </PERSON>, 35, convicted of killing one police officer and charged with shooting another, was arrested April 14 in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. The third escapee, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, 28, convicted of murder, arson and robbery, was caught late last month in <LOCATION> Mercer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>.

 A jury began deliberating the fate of reputed mob boss <PERSON> Nicodemo </PERSON> `` Little Nicky'' <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON> and eight associates Monday after hearing the prosecutor defend her two key witnesses in the murder case. The jury will return to the courtroom of Common Pleas Judge <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabo </PERSON> on Tuesday morning to continue deliberations. The 59-year-old <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON>, who police allege ran the area's Mafia from his home in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, before his arrest in 1986, and the other eight defendants are charged with the Sept. 14, 1984, murder of rival <PERSON> Salvatore </PERSON> <PERSON> Testa </PERSON>. <PERSON> Testa </PERSON>'s body, with two bullets in the head, was found trussed with rope and wrapped in a blanket in a wooded area in <LOCATION> south </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. The trial began more than two months ago. Jury selection took more than four weeks, and the testimony phase took another month. Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s 78-minute closing statement followed almost eight hours of defense arguments over two days last week and an hour Monday morning. She acknowledged that prosecution witnesses <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Caramandi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> DelGiorno </PERSON> were despicable men. `` Rats? Yes,'' Ms. <PERSON> Christie </PERSON> said. `` But when you enter a sewer do n't rats lead the way? ... `` DelGiorno and <PERSON> Caramandi </PERSON> told you that <PERSON> Nicky </PERSON> <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON> was the boss and that <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON>' organization eliminated problems and dissension by simple execution.'' Caramanda and <PERSON> DelGiorno </PERSON> testified <PERSON> Testa </PERSON> was murdered in a south <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> candy store, closed for renovations, and the body was driven in a van across the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and dumped along a road. <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Simone </PERSON>, on Monday morning continued the attack on the two witnesses that his eight colleagues had made in their closing arguments. `` When are <PERSON> DelGiorno </PERSON> and <PERSON> Caramandi </PERSON> telling the truth and when are they lying?'' <PERSON> Simone </PERSON> asked. `` We have to guess, and you ca n't convict these men on guesses If <PERSON> Testa </PERSON> was killed in that sweet shop, you would have evidence, blood, something.'' He maintained that <PERSON> Testa </PERSON> actually was killed in his own home and that the murderers were <PERSON> Caramandi </PERSON> and DelGiorno. <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON>, who still faces murder charges in two other slayings, was convicted last year of trying to extort $ 1 million from a developer.

<HEAD>Abnormality in Schizophrenic Brains Pinpointed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A study of schizophrenics' brains suggests a possible answer to a decades-old mystery about an abnormality associated with the illness, a researcher said Monday. Brain scans of 17 living patients pinpointed a site of a reduction in brain tissue that apparently produces enlargement of normal brain cavities, said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Suddath </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>. The enlargement of the fluid-filed spaces, called ventricles, had been observed since the 1930s, but nobody has known which part of the brain produces it, he said. Failure of part of the brain to develop, or shrinkage, could produce the enlargement, he said. If the new finding is confirmed, it points the way to an anatomical target for further study of schizophrenia, he said. <PERSON> Suddath </PERSON> spoke to reporters at the annual meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychiatric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. He did the work with colleagues at the mental health institute. The brain scans, using a technique called magnetic resonance imaging, found an average of a 20 percent reduction in the gray matter of the temporal lobes, compared with the volume found in 17 normal people of similar age and size. The temporal lobes lie beneath the temples on each side of the head. The less temporal lobe gray matter a patient had, the larger his lateral ventricles tended to be, implicating that tissue was at least part of the explanation for enlargement of the ventricles, <PERSON> Suddath </PERSON> said. Researchers do not know when the reduction in gray matter appears in comparison to when schizophrenia appears, he said. It may be a failure of the tisue to develop before birth or around the time of birth, he said. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Freedman </PERSON>, director of the division of adult psychiatry at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Neuropsychiatric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, noted that the study included few patients. `` It's too soon to say'' whether it will pay off in better diagnosis or predicting response to treatment, he said. But it is `` a promising start'' in using magnetic resonance imaging to seek clues to brain abnormalities in schizophrenia, he said.

 Fire officials said Monday that they failed to determine how a fire ignited in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s tallest building because 2,000-degree flames destroyed clues, but they said arson was not suspected. City fire investigators and agents from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firearms </ORGANIZATION> completed their inquiry and turned over control of the building to <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday. `` They pretty much ruled out it being a case of arson,'' said bank spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>. `` At this time, the cause has been listed as undetermined in origin,'' said city fire Capt. <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>. `` The extent of the damages prevents us from listing a ... definitive cause.'' Further questions about the investigators' inquiry were referred to Fire Chief <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Manning </PERSON>, who scheduled a Tuesday news conference to discuss the findings. Earlier, Battalion Chief <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowie </PERSON> played down suggestions that the bank's decision to sell its securities unit the day of Wednesday's fire played a role in the blaze that killed one person and injured 40 others. `` No one interviewed has said that there's a possibility of an incendiary fire of any type,'' he said. Meanwhile, suitcase - and box-toting employees of companies with offices in the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> tower retrieved documents from the fire-scarred, 62-story tower Wearing hard hats and accompanied by security officers, employees boarded elevators for the ascent to offices above and below gutted floors 12 through 16. Many of the employees filled boxes, bags, suitcases and briefcases with files, computer disks and telephone lists. `` They had 15 minutes to select the things they need the most,'' said bank spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Popovich </PERSON>. He said the bank had gotten many of its employees back to work either in the undamaged parts of the building or in nearby leased space, thanks to an emergency plan designed for earthquakes. He said it would take 10 days to four weeks to clean up smoke and water damage, but there was no estimate on the time to rebuild the gutted floors. The fire department's preliminary estimate of $ 450 million was `` exceedingly high,'' <PERSON> Popovich </PERSON> said.

 Former Illinois Gov. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ogilvie </PERSON> suffered a massive heart attack at work Monday and was in grave condition following emergency bypass surgery, hospital officials said. Surgeons performed a quadruple coronary bypass in a five-hour operation that was `` a total success,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Renee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartz </PERSON>, who led the surgical team. But she said <PERSON> Ogilvie </PERSON> was in grave condition and his prognosis was `` totally unclear.'' The former governor's heart was beating almost completely on its own after the surgery, Ms. <PERSON> Hartz </PERSON> said, adding doctors would know much more about his chances for recovery in the morning. His condition was described as `` quite grave, quite guarded'' by Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>, Northwestern's chief of staff, at an afternoon news conference. `` When we operate in the midst of a heart attack in which the heart is unable to provide adequate pumping capability, we ca n't say with any certainty if the heart will pump adequately when we're done,'' said <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>, a cardiac The former governor had `` not to anyone's knowledge'' suffered a previous heart attack, <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Ogilvie </PERSON> did have `` a history of risk factors,'' the doctor said, adding he did not have the background to elaborate. <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON> said a triple bypass appeared likely, based on emergency-room instrument readings, which indicated <PERSON> Ogilvie </PERSON> suffered a massive coronary. The former governor's daughter, <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>, and her husband were at the hospital. <PERSON> Ogilvie </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON>, was en route from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ogilvie </PERSON> was stricken at his downtown law office. He was `` awake and able to respond'' when he arrived at the hospital, thanks to quick action by paramedics, <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON> said.

 Gunmen fired from a passing van at troopers guarding a television transmitter Monday, wounding at least one soldier, the military reported. Officials said shooting continued for more than half an hour because the guards were confused and fired at policemen and other soldiers coming to their aid. `` The guards thought the responding troops belonged to the same group that had attacked them,'' police Sgt. <PERSON> Estelito </PERSON> <PERSON> Cadag </PERSON> said. He said it took military officials about two hours to determine what had happened at the compound housing the <ORGANIZATION> Kanlaon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> transmitter in suburban <LOCATION> Quezon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Another television station, <ORGANIZATION> ABS-CBN </ORGANIZATION>, reported that soldiers guarding the transmitter were intoxicated and began firing their weapons into the air. It said those soldiers then fired at police who responded to complaints from residents. The military's <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> said it could was investigating the <ORGANIZATION> ABS-CBN </ORGANIZATION> report. <PERSON> Cadag </PERSON> said the lone military casualty was a corporal with a gunshot wound in the right thigh. Officials said they did not know if anyone body in the van was hit in the exchange. Military guards are posted at radio and television stations because of at least six coup attempts against President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s 2-year-old government. Col. <PERSON> Toto </PERSON> <PERSON> Arroyo </PERSON>, legal officer of the army unit guarding the <LOCATION> Kanlaon </LOCATION> transmitter, said: `` The guards were momentarily taken aback because the firing was so intense and they did n't know where it was coming from. After a few seconds they returned fire and the van sped away.'' <PERSON> Arroyo </PERSON> would not speculate about the identities of the attackers or their motive, saying only that they were `` a van of armed men who had a lot of weapons ... automatic weapons.'' The last and most serious coup attempt occurred Aug. 28 led by Lt. Col. <PERSON> Gregorio </PERSON> <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON>, who escaped from a prison ship last month and threatened more attacks. At least 53 people were killed and hundreds wounded in the August attacks.

 Smoggy air in the nation's cities may become significantly cleaner than official projections indicate, new discoveries about auto pollution suggest. Planned new federal regulations to make gasoline less volatile _ harder to vaporize _ may cure a problem only now being recognized, some analysts say. This is the evaporation of gasoline from cars in use, called `` running loss.'' All cars have systems designed to control evaporation while parked. The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> has assumed the system also prevents significant vapors from escaping when the car is driven. On a hot day, it now appears, the system can be overwhelmed and release five to 25 times more unburned gasoline than is permitted in exhaust. The findings are so new that no one has had a chance to calculate their effect. But they suggest that plans for less volatile gasoline may significantly reduce this previously underestimated contributor to smog.

 Landlords with rifles and sticks ride motorcycles menacingly across fields where peasants work _ often for a wage of grain, not money. But the hopes of many peasants are riding with communist guerrillas whose aim is the violent overthrow of those they deem oppressors _ the high-caste landlords of <LOCATION> Bihar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s poorest and most backward state. Officials concede that the landlords are a law unto themselves in <LOCATION> Bihar </LOCATION> and are resisting peasant demands for something better than payments in grain, a common practice in rural <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. `` The landlords do n't give us wages,'' peasant worker <PERSON> Mateshwari </PERSON> <PERSON> Devi </PERSON> said as she sat recently on the floor of her mud hut. `` If we fight, they rain bullets on us. We neither have land nor grain. How are we to survive?'' In recent years, however, the Maoist guerrillas have been organizing peasants and have become enforcers, meting out their own `` instant justice.'' Known as Naxalites after <PERSON> Naxalbari </PERSON>, the town where their movement was founded, the guerrillas have been gunning down landlords judged by them to be oppressors of the poor. The Naxalites' `` <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'' also has clashed with the landlords' private armies, which peasant leaders and press reports say terrorize low-caste communities At least 205 people have died in 898 `` violent incidents'' in <LOCATION> Bihar </LOCATION> since 1983, according to official figures. News reports and civil libertarians put the toll at more than 450. The state's 85,000-member police force has tried to stop the killings, but officials say the problem goes deeper than just establishing law and order. They maintain it stems from the abject poverty of the low-caste masses and alleged injustices of landlords who are almost always from the upper castes. The caste system of hereditary social grouping was legally abolished in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> in 1949, after independence from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, but it still fuels tensions between the haves and have-nots. R.N. Dash, <LOCATION> Bihar </LOCATION> state's home secretary, said the Naxalites do get results. `` This is an economic issue, and the Naxalites provide an aggressive forum for airing peoples' grievances,'' he said. `` When they agitate, roads get built and things happen.'' <LOCATION> Bihar </LOCATION>'s 80 million people have an annual per capita income the equivalent of $ 111, in contrast to a national average of $ 254. In April 1987, police opened fire on a meeting of about 300 peasants and laborers, killing 23 people. Local activists charged that it came about at the instigation of K.D. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, a local landlord. The rally had been called to protest <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>'s claim to a tiny piece of land the government had granted to poor families. The findings of an official inquiry were never made public. But officials, speaking only on condition of anonymity, said the inquiry found the police action justified on grounds of `` apprehension of breach of peace.'' The activists claimed that <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> had arranged for the police to open fire and that he himself joined in the shooting. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> was shot to death this past Feb. 27; local people say the Naxalites killed him. <PERSON> Shia </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharan </PERSON>, whose eldest son was killed in the shooting a year ago, said he fully supports the Naxalites' tactics. He added that he has been unsuccessful in his attempts to bring his son's killers to justice. `` I have tried everything legal. I have sent telegrams to the authorities, but no action has been taken,'' he said, showing a neat file of documents and newspaper clippings. `` We wo n't leave this land. My son died for it, and the government can fire on us again if it wants.'' In nearby <LOCATION> Haibetpur </LOCATION> village, another story unfolds. Residents said supporters of <PERSON> Awadhesh </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, a landlord from the warrior Rajput caste, opened fire on Aug. 27, 1987, on farm laborers who were demanding better wages. They were receiving about a kilogram -LRB- 2.2 pounds -RRB- of grain as a day's wages and were seeking $ 1.15 a day. At least 26 workers were wounded. Police later filed charges against some of the laborers, many of whom are now fugitives. A police post has been set up next to <PERSON> Awadesh </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>'s house to protect him from Naxalite attack. He said his supporters opened fire because the laborers had attacked him. His workers live in mud and thatch huts and sleep on straw piled on the dirt floors. He lives in a two-story, eight-room house, which has large wooden beds, radios, glassware and <LOCATION> china </LOCATION> _ status symbols of rural <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. Some top officials in <LOCATION> Patna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bihar </LOCATION>'s capital, agree that reforms are needed. `` The system has lost its credibility with the people and the Naxalites. They say this system stands for vested interests,'' said <PERSON> Dinesh </PERSON> <PERSON> Nandan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sahay </PERSON>, inspector general of police. <PERSON> Bihjar </PERSON>'s newly elected chief minister, <PERSON> Bhagwat </PERSON> <PERSON> Jha </PERSON> <PERSON> Azad </PERSON>, said land reforms must be implemented because many landlords own hundreds of acres of land far in excess of government ceilings. But he denounced the Naxalites' instant justice. `` No one should take the law into his hands,'' <PERSON> Azad </PERSON> said. `` A society has both good and bad people. The problem is that bad ones are very well organized and we need to organize the good people.''

<TEXT>
 On a frozen peninsula on the fringe of Soviet territory, fishing boats riding at anchor tell the story of the plight of this small Japanese town and its people of the sea. At one time Numero's ships chased salmon across the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> soon after the harbor ice thawed in April. Now they lie in port, victims of shrinking fish quotas in nearby waters, shortened fishing seasons and an off-limits zone around islands where many of <PERSON> Numero </PERSON>'s people were born _ all laid out by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The Japanese lost its <LOCATION> Kuril </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> to the Soviets at the end of World War II. In the late summer of 1945, Soviet troops arrived on the southernmost of the islands and routed their 17,000 Japanese dwellers. <LOCATION> Nemuro </LOCATION>, in northern Hokkaido, is just two miles from <LOCATION> Kuril </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> now occupied by Soviet troops, weapons and warplanes. <LOCATION> Nemuro </LOCATION>'s is caught in a chokehold, and its population of 39,000 is in decline because of it. `` This town is sinking economically,'' said Mayor <PERSON> Kaiji </PERSON> <PERSON> Ohya </PERSON>. `` For more than 100 years, fishing has been our livelihood. Now we ca n't fish near the islands we pioneered. `` We want them back.'' <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> maintains the Soviet occupation of the Kurils is illegal. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, however, cites a wartime Allied pact giving it control of all the Kurils. The dispute keeps the two countries from signing a formal World War II peace treaty. But the worst part for <LOCATION> Nemuro </LOCATION> is that the harder <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> campaigns for the islands' return, the tighter the Soviets draw the net around Japanese fishing. `` If we raise our voices, they take it out on us fishermen,'' said <PERSON> Akimi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kubota </PERSON>, captain of a 90-ton ship. Nowadays he has to steer his vessel past the islands where he was born to waters south of the Soviet territorial line to fill his 50-ton quota. Thirty years ago, before the limits began to shrink, his ship could take on 100 tons. The salmon and trout seasons then were twice as long as the current three-month season, and the fishable waters were closer to home. <LOCATION> Nemuro </LOCATION>'s pre-eminence in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s lucrative salmon market has faded, and businesses in <LOCATION> Nemuro </LOCATION> are going bankrupt at an increasing rate _ from four in 1977 to 25 eight years later. `` If you squeeze the fishing industry, <LOCATION> Nemuro </LOCATION> becomes unlivable,'' <PERSON> Kubota </PERSON> said. `` There is that basic link. Half my friends are gone. Many are still without work. It may be all right to lose your job while you're young, but what do you do if you're already getting old? <LOCATION> Nemuro </LOCATION>'s people speak hopefully of the new course set out by <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, the Soviet leader. His signing of the missile treaty with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in December and the upcomming withdrawal of Soviet troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> have eased two major obstacles to normalizing Japanese-Soviet relations. `` This is a golden opportunity,'' said Professor <PERSON> Hiroshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kimura </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> Hokkaido </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Slavic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. `` Fish must be sacrificed for the islands. Be patient three or four more years.'' Foreign Minister <PERSON> Sosuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has applauded <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s actions One former islander is <PERSON> Sadao </PERSON> <PERSON> Nishida </PERSON>, a fisheries dealer who keeps a rock in his hallway from <LOCATION> Shikotan </LOCATION>, the island he left as a child. He remembers summers riding wild horses and swimming with them in clear, icy waters. He was 10 years old on Sept. 1, 1945, two weeks after <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> lost the war. `` We never thought the Russians would come,'' he said. `` <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> lost to the Americans, after all. `` That night we saw the lights of a ship. Was it American? And then around six in the morning we saw the red flag with the hammer and sickle.'' One-third of the island's people fled that day and eventually 60 percent of the territories' 17,385 residents resettled in <LOCATION> Nemuro </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Nishida </PERSON> said the Soviets permitted him to return to <LOCATION> Shikotan </LOCATION> twice to visit graves of relatives. `` There was n't a single house from the past,'' he said. `` All the buildings were Russian. And most of the Soviets were women. `` They were such nice people. If you gave them something, they absolutely had to give you something in return. `` I thought they might give back the islands.''

 <PERSON> Loretta </PERSON> <PERSON> Swit </PERSON>, who spent 11 years playing a nurse in a Korean War field hospital on `` M-A-S-H,'' finally got to <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> for a new documentary that explores <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s forgotten war. She is the host of `` Korean War _ The Untold Story,'' a one-hour documentary put together by <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> winner <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> and Emmy winner <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleisher </PERSON>. The war, which claimed 54,000 lives in three years, is a neglected chapter in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history. It was the first war involving jet fighters, the first in which American troops fought Communist troops and the first in which the enemy attempted to `` brainwash'' American prisoners of war. The one-hour documentary combines historic film with new interviews with people who participated in the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> `` police action.'' The nationally syndicated special will be televised around the country from May 11 to May 31. So far, 118 stations have signed up to air the show. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> keeps 40,000 troops in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to enforce a cease-fire that is now 35 years old. The show notes the truce anniversary and the Summer Olympic Games in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> this September. `` After all those years of pretending, they took me in hand and said it's time to go,'' said <PERSON> Swit </PERSON>, who was Nurse <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Houlihan </PERSON> in the comedy series. `` I'd never been to <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> before. We went up to the DMZ. I was standing just a few feet away from a concrete line that divides the country.'' `` We were all astonished at the border,'' said producer <PERSON> Fleisher </PERSON>. `` You do n't realize we're technically still at war. It's the longest cease-fire in history The tension is there at all times.'' <PERSON> Swit </PERSON> said North Korean loudspeakers bombard the border with propaganda urging the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> soldiers to defect. Not far away is `` Propaganda Village,'' a facade to try to lure <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Koreans </LOCATION> across the line. `` The flag flying over the village weighs 600 pounds, and the day we were there it stood straight out from the flag pole,'' said <PERSON> Swit </PERSON>. `` That's how strong the wind was. It was 20 degrees below zero. My fingernails froze. My nose turned blue. I had to do some narration there and I could hardly talk.'' <PERSON> Swit </PERSON> went to the <LOCATION> Inchon </LOCATION> site where Gen. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> MacArthur </PERSON>'s forces landed in 1950 and turned the tide in favor of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, until the Chinese intervened a few months later She also visited the new Olympic stadium in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> in her week-long stay in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON>, who won an Academy Award in 1979 for `` Scared Straight,'' was the executive producer, and <PERSON> Fleisher </PERSON>, who won an Emmy for co-writing `` The Singing Cowboys Ride Again,'' was the producer, writer and director. `` We talked to veterans who had lost arms and legs and they said they would do it again,'' said <PERSON> Fleisher </PERSON>. `` They felt the war was worth it.'' `` It was an illuminating experience for me,'' said <PERSON> Swit </PERSON>. `` I thought I knew the subject, having served my time on ` M-A-S-H.' I found out how little I really knew. Asked about `` <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>,'' the new <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> series about women in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Swit </PERSON> said, `` I'm so glad people will know that women were in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. I'm involved in trying to get a memorial for women near the wall in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Swit </PERSON> also works with the <ORGANIZATION> Audubon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, which she calls `` my other occupation,'' to support animal rights. She has worked with the society on documentaries and recently teamed with <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Redford </PERSON> as hosts of a PBS series on species threatened with extinction. She returns to comedy in a movie made in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, called `` Whoops! Apocalypse.'' `` I play the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' she said. `` I took a lot of kidding from people who said I had peaked as a major in ` M-A-S-H.'''

 So you're a television producer and you want to get a show on the air. And once you get that show on the air, you want it to stay on the air. What do you do? Hire the best talent in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>? Butter up network executives who can put you on after `` Cosby''? Hire a detective agency to locate <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON> families? Nope. Throw out all those theories about <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON> samples and demographics and time periods and counter-programming. In the prime-time game, it's all in the name. The right kind of punctuation will sell a show. Just look at CBS. Put an ampersand in the title, and it's a go: `` Kate & amp; <PERSON> Allie </PERSON>,'' `` <ORGANIZATION> Eisenhower </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Lutz </PERSON>,'' `` <ORGANIZATION> Cagney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Lacey </PERSON>,'' & amp;, of course, `` <ORGANIZATION> Simon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>.'' `` The Law and <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> McGraw </PERSON>'' was canceled precisely because it had no ampersand. This, of course, does not explain `` Beauty and the Beast,'' but, hey, a prediction: by the third season, they'll open a private detective agency and call it `` Beauty & amp; <LOCATION> Beast </LOCATION>,'' or maybe just `` B & amp; B.'' CBS is also partial to commas. They make shows sound more intelligent: `` Murder -LRB- comma -RRB- She Wrote,'' `` Magnum -LRB- comma -RRB- P.I.'' You know these people did n't just drop off a dangling participle or something. Those daring <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> executives eschew such mundane punctuation as commas and periods and go more for such exotic symbols as question marks, colons, quotations within quotations, e.e. cummings-style lower-case and even exclamation points: `` Who's the Boss?'' `` thirtysomething,'' `` Spenser: For Hire,'' `` The ` Slap' Maxwell Story,'' `` Sledge Hammer!'' `` Dolly!'' To get a news show into prime time, it must have a number in the title, which explains why `` Our World'' did n't make it, though a fictional show called `` A Different World'' did. -LRB- That may have something to do with one being opposite `` Cosby'' and the other following it. -RRB- Note `` 60 Minutes,'' `` 48 Hours,'' `` West 57th'' and `` 20 @ 20,'' which also has the distinction of being the only network slash show. Numbers did not help `` 1986,'' but that was because it was doomed to be out of date within the year. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> does n't care for oddball punctuation, despite having once had one of the pioneers in oddball punctuation, `` The A-Team,'' and settling for one all-capitals show this season, `` ALF,'' which stands for `` Alien Life Form.'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> also has one all-numbers show, `` 227,'' a street address. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> goes in more for mainstream catch-phrases: `` Facts of Life,'' `` Family Ties,'' `` Amen,'' `` Cheers,'' `` A Year in the Life,'' `` Day by Day.'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> also likes short titles, which may explain some executive consternation about `` The Days and Nights of <PERSON> Molly </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>.'' Many words, yes, but at least there's no punctuation. Another way to help your show with any network: give it a one-word title _ `` MacGyver,'' `` <PERSON> Newhart </PERSON>,'' `` ALF,'' `` Moonlighting,'' `` thirtysomething,'' `` Wiseguy,'' `` <PERSON> Matlock </PERSON>,'' `` <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>,'' `` Hooperman,'' `` Dynasty,'' `` The Equalizer'' -LRB- the `` the'' does n't count -RRB-, `` Cheers,'' `` <PERSON> Ohara </PERSON>,'' `` Hunter'' and `` Amen.'' Talk show hosts have long since learned this lesson: `` Donahue,'' `` Oprah,'' `` <PERSON> Geraldo </PERSON>.'' Even `` The Tonight Show'' and `` Late Night'' are more often referred to simply as `` Carson'' and `` <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON>.'' Who can say that `` Once a Hero,'' the first show canceled last fall, would n't have been a smash hit if it was called simply `` Hero''? How about `` The Oldest Rookie'' as `` Rookie'' _ Top 10 show, no doubt about it. Who's to say `` Tour of Duty'' would n't have beaten `` The Cosby Show'' -LRB- always trimmed to the more familiar `` Cosby'' -RRB- if it had been called simply, say, `` War'' Of course, there are exceptions: `` Valerie'' became `` Valerie's Family'' and still did OK. `` Downtown,'' `` Wizard'' and `` Starman'' did n't make it despite catchy, one-word Surely CBS' `` Leg Work'' would have been a hit without the space. Two-word titles are acceptable, but only for cop shows: `` <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> Vice,'' `` Crime Story,'' `` <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Knights </ORGANIZATION>.'' Not private eye shows, which must have one - or three-word titles: `` <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>,'' `` The Equalizer'' -LRB- the `` the'' does n't count -RRB-, `` <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Buntz </LOCATION>,'' `` Spenser: For Hire. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> would never have had ratings problems with `` <PERSON> J.J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Starbuck </PERSON>'' if they dropped the darn initials. All right, all right, so there's `` <LOCATION> L.A </LOCATION> Law.'' Some shows will be hits no matter what they're called. `` A Different World'' could have been called `` The Show After Cosby,'' or, in keeping with short, simple titles, `` Show,'' and it would still be No. 2. It's just a theory.

<HEAD>Inflation Isn't a Sure Thing</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also on financial wires.</NOTE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> has issued an economic policy paper challenging the widespread fear that the economy is expanding into a period of dangerously rapid inflation. It calls the growing references to inflation by economists, bankers and investment advisers a phobia based in part on the assumption that economic growth per se is inflationary, and partly on misreadings of the evidence. It states that while the inflation rate could grow this year and into 1989, it is unlikely that anything similar to the double digit inflation of the 1970s lies in the future. In fact, says <PERSON> Graciela </PERSON> <PERSON> Testa-Ortiz </PERSON>, forecast director of the economic policy division, the possibility exists `` that the national economy has enough momentum to continue to grow with a declining rate of inflation.'' Inflation fears have intensified recently for several reasons, including a declining unemployment rate, rising rates of factory utilization, a lowering of the dollar's trade value, and increases in food and housing prices. Among the most oft-cited evidence of an upturn in inflation was the sharp increase in monthly consumer prices of 0.5 percent in March, compared with a 0.2 percent rise in February, and the graphic depiction of that increase on widely published bar charts. The Chamber challenged such usage of charts, however, by showing that inflation, plotted quarterly instead of monthly, shows steady declines from the first quarter of 1987 through the first quarter of 1988. `` When the quarterly data are plotted, the real inflation trend is revealed, and it is starkly different than the one portrayed,'' it said, adding: `` These numbers are not a fluke or a statistical construct; the decline in inflationary pressures as measured by the CPI is corroborated by the implicit deflation for gross national product, a broader measure of inflation.'' Many analysts posit that economic growth is inflationary because it is assumed there are strict limits to economic growth, with shortages and inefficiencies developing as industries reach productive capacity. But, the paper contends, such reasoning assumes plant capacity is a given and can not be changed, whereas `` the truth is that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> firms have been expanding their capacity to produce since the recovery began.'' Moreover, it continues, wage increases that often accompany a declining jobless rate have been muted by foreign competition. In addition, output per hour per person has also risen, further alleviating inflation pressures. The paper counters the argument that a rise in oil prices is likely by arguing that lower oil prices are just as possible. `` The reality of the oil picture is one of plentiful supplies,'' it says. While many forecasters say the dollar's lower value will eventually force inflation into the system, mainly because foreign producers may have to raise <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> prices, the paper notes that so far such increases have been small. The paper contends the major inflation concern relates to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>. `` It is the rapid increases in the money supply that causes inflation to rise, and its volatility which thwarts growth.'' It calls for stability and moderation in the growth of the money supply, and a de-emphasis on month-to-month statistical evidence and sudden reactions to them, in favor of longer-term trends.

<HEAD>Fiji Still Feeling Effects of Coup a Year Ago</HEAD>

 A year after a military coup ended democratic government in <LOCATION> Fiji </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> nation is still reeling in the aftermath of a conflict that arose over Fijian fears of domination by the Indian population. The economy is shaky, and skilled professionals and civil servants, mostly Indians, are leaving for <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> at a rate of 500 a month, double the precoup figure. Sugar production, the country's major cash crop is down 20.3 percent; tourism has dropped 26.9 percent, the currency has been devalued 33 percent, inflation has tripled to 6 percent, unemployment has reached 7.5 percent and the gross domestic product is down 11 percent. The coup of May 14, 1987, was led by Lt. Col. <PERSON> Sitiveni </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabuka </PERSON> who claimed that a newly elected coalition government dominated by the decendants of immigrants from <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> threatened the future of ethnic Fijians. The Indians outnumbered Fijians 348,704 to 329,305 at the time and controlled trade and commerce. The election of an Indian-controlled government led to the army coup. Prime Minister <PERSON> Timoci </PERSON> <PERSON> Bavadra </PERSON>, a Fijian, and his Cabinet were arrested. The Constitution was suspended and rule by decree was put in force. Since then ethnic Fijian fears of Indian political supremacy have eased. But the coup virtually ended organized political activities, but the country is now seeing factional and clan rivalries among Fijian chiefs in a feud over a Fijian king. It was to solve just such rivalries that King <PERSON> Seru </PERSON> <PERSON> Cakobau </PERSON> handed over the islands, then known as the <ORGANIZATION> Cannibal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Isles </ORGANIZATION>, to <PERSON> Queen </PERSON> <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in 1874, after first having tried to interest the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Ratu Sir <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Cakobau </PERSON>, grandson of the king and a former prime minister, now claims the royal title, which had been vacant since the British took control. But other chiefs and clans are disputing <PERSON> Cakobau </PERSON>'s claim to the title. <PERSON> Bavadra </PERSON>, the ousted prime minister, said he feared squabbling among the chiefs could provoke a violent reaction from Fijians feeling the effects of the economic downturn since the coup. Watching the tribal feuds with interest is the 39-year-old <PERSON> Rabuka </PERSON>, who is a commoner. He has become a cult figure to many ethnic Fijians who regard him as the savior of their culture. He is the minister for home affairs in the interim government he appointed to run the country until a new constitution is drafted and elections held. A new book, `` Rabuka _ No Other Way,'' giving <PERSON> Rabuka </PERSON>'s account of the coup, became an instant best seller. Also in demand is an autographed color poster of <PERSON> Rabuka </PERSON> in an army T-shirt and bearing the slogan, `` <LOCATION> Fiji </LOCATION>. In God's Hands.'' A documentary film titled `` Operation Surprise,'' the code name for the coup, has been showing to packed houses. <LOCATION> Fiji </LOCATION> has has no television. One of the first acts by <PERSON> Rabuka </PERSON>, a Methodist lay preacher, former rugby star and veteran of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nations </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace force was to make the religious observance of Sundays compulsory. No shops are allowed to open, no sports can be played, public transport halts and the populace is expected, but not yet compelled, to go to church. But the Sunday observance law has become so unpopular that even the <ORGANIZATION> Fiji </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION> has called for its repeal. In the best-selling book, written by a Fijian and an Australian, <PERSON> Rabuka </PERSON> says the majority of <LOCATION> Fiji </LOCATION>'s Indians are heathens and should be converted to Christianity. Most of the Indians are Hindus. `` I do n't think they will resent it,'' <PERSON> Rabuka </PERSON> is quoted as saying, `` because all we are trying to do is the same thing that missionaries did here in <LOCATION> Fiji </LOCATION> when we were cannibals and heathens.'' In the year since the coup, Indian leaders have fled or taken a low profile. But one Indian who remains prominent is <PERSON> Irene </PERSON> <PERSON> Narayan </PERSON>, 56, <PERSON> Rabuka </PERSON>'s minister for Indian affairs. She said in an interview the Indian community is now without a political leader, but added she saw little likelihood of communal violence between Fijians and Indians,. She expressed the view that while some Indians have left, the majority will remain and probably accept their loss of political rights. `` If Fijians want dominance and they are happy with it, perhaps that's not high a price for Indians to pay,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Narayan </PERSON> said. Meanwhile, <LOCATION> Fiji </LOCATION>'s relations with traditonal friends and neighbors are taking time to mend. <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> condemned <PERSON> Rabuka </PERSON>'s coup. They called their ambassadors home and suspended aid, but the envoys of all three have since returned. <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> have resumed non-military aid, but relations remain chilly.

<HEAD>Fish and Chips Shops Spruce Up to Meet Hamburger Challenge</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The Hi-Tide is no longer your run-of-the-mill fish and chips shop. The American hamburger, fried chicken and pizza have seen to that. Instead of the greasy, colorless decor that typifies many British fish and chips places, the Hi-Tide is a large combination restaurant-takeout business refurbished with `` Old English'' decor of wood beams, exposed brick and lanterns. The kitchen gleams and the large staff is eager to please. The reason for this is just down the main shopping street of this tidy northeast <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> suburb: a hamburger stand, a <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fried </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicken </ORGANIZATION> outlet and a pizza parlor. McDonald's is coming soon. Fish and chips are still <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s biggest-selling fast food, but the trade is under siege and having to fight back. `` The competition is very, very fierce,'' said <PERSON> Hi-Tide </PERSON>'s owner, <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Laycock </PERSON>. `` I'd be lying to you if I said it did n't hurt.'' Not only is there competition, there are image problems too. The health-conscious are shunning fried foods, and young Britons say eating fish is n't trendy. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, marketing director for Edinburgh-based Sea Fish Industry, says fish and chips shops `` are maintaining their level of sales but they are not sharing in the expansion of hot food takeaway as a whole.'' Said <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Phelps </PERSON>, president of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Friers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>: `` We're having to pull our socks up, obviously.'' Fish and chips have been a national food since the 19th-century industrial revolution, when trains and steam trawlers started bringing it to the neighborhoods of the new working class. The meal usually consists of succulent cod, deep-fried in batter, and stubby French fries called chips, all sprinkled liberally with malt vinegar and salt. Mushy peas are optional. Until the advent of modern packaging, the fish and chips came wrapped in an old newspaper to soak up the grease. A order now costs an average of 1.25 pounds -LRB- $ 2.34 -RRB-, about half the price of a <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mac </ORGANIZATION>, fries and soft drink. Nicknamed `` chippies,'' fish and chips shops generally have been small businesses run by married couples out of the front rooms of their terraced houses. But gentrification of these terraces has driven out many shops, and they are scarce even in central <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> today. As the new competition has intensified in the past 10 years, `` chippies'' are becoming larger, and chains and partnerships are forming. Although most shops remain English-owned, Chinese, Greek and <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> immigrants are moving in. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> had 9,500 fish and chips shops in 1986, representing 52.1 percent of the multibillion-dollar fast food market, down from 10,750 shops and 55.3 percent in 1981, according to Sea Fish Industry. Today, annual fish and chips sales total the equivalent of about $ 935 million, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Friers </ORGANIZATION> said. The fight for survival is multi-pronged. More are providing seating for their customers. <PERSON> Laycock </PERSON>, who offers 42 seats, says: `` Takeaway is too blunt, it is too quick. You ca n't converse with a customer like in a restaurant.'' The shops have improved flavor by using better batters and oils, and are packaging meals in lidded cardboard boxes, <PERSON> Phelps </PERSON> said. Industry associations now run training courses for their members and are countering the health issue with a low-key public relations campaign. `` People say that fried food is unhealthy and too much fried food will lead to heart disease,'' said <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Parrington </PERSON>, head of the Leeds-based national federation. `` We say, ` Moderation in all things.''' <PERSON> Laycock </PERSON>, 45, says he spent 100,000 pounds -LRB- $ 187,000 -RRB- renovating the run-down fish and chips shop he bought in 1974. He reports business is better, and he is considering getting a liquor license. As a director of <ORGANIZATION> Old </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bylands </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, a 20-shop chain, <PERSON> Laycock </PERSON> travels to outlets to teach managers how to fight the competition from the hamburger, fried chicken and pizza. `` There will be less of us. The ones that are left will be highly specialized and efficient,'' he said. `` This is a very dying trade, but I think we still have a place in English society.''

<HEAD>Sudan Has Severe Problems after Two Years of Civilian Rule</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DALIA BALIGH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Reminiscent of the 1970s oil crisis around the world, Sudanese wait in line these days as long as 12 hours for gasoline. Lines form as well for sugar, bread and other necessities in short supply. Two years after army generals gave power to Prime Minister <PERSON> Sadek </PERSON> <PERSON> el-Mahdi </PERSON>, his civilian government is having to contend with a faltering economy and a costly war in the south. Inflation reaching 70 percent has sent prices soaring, and strikes are commonplace as workers try to deal with it. The war costs the government an estimated $ 1 million a day in borrowed money. <PERSON> El-Mahdi </PERSON> won national elections in April 1986, a year after the military overthrew <PERSON> Gaafar </PERSON> <PERSON> Nimeiri </PERSON>, the president for 16 years. But <PERSON> el-Mahdi </PERSON> sees a bright side to his two years as the nation's leader `` We have moved the country from a famine-stricken, collapsed economy to a working economy which is able to feed itself and which has resumed its contacts with the international community on an equitable and just basis,'' he said in an interview. Many Sudanese and foreign diplomats disagree. Sudanese joke about it: `` There's democracy, a lot of democracy, but that's about the only commodity available.'' Said a diplomat: `` In theory, if <PERSON> el-Mahdi </PERSON>'s government continues to drift with no firm program, that plus economic distress surely will affect the democratic process and increase the possibility of a military takeover. That's been the cycle historically.'' It has taken most of <PERSON> el-Mahdi </PERSON>'s time and all his political prowess in the last two years to maintain equilibrium among the country's 35 diverse political parties and 597 tribes. He fired his Cabinet on grounds of inefficiency in the spring of 1986, and the next one lasted less than a year. The crisis that followed remains unresolved as <PERSON> el-Mahdi </PERSON> seeks to put together and effective coalition of the five largest political parties _ a mixture of center-right, Moslem fundamentalists and non-Moslem southerners. The major stumbling block is finding alternatives to Islamic law that <PERSON> Nimeiri </PERSON> implemented in 1983. Although ignored since the 1985 coup, the law of Islam remain officially as <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s basic law. <PERSON> Nimeiri </PERSON> avoided economic problems by securing foreign loans. The <ORGANIZATION> Transitional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> that replaced him froze interest payments on those loans. <PERSON> El-Mahdi </PERSON>, whose government must deal with a $ 12-billion foreign debt, says his government ca n't be responsible for the mistakes of past leaders. That position enticed countries like <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> to write off <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s debts to them. But <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> is not likely to hold out much longer on the foreign aid it is now getting and foreign lenders are expected to extend more loans without some form of economic reform. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other foreign donors pour in $ 700 million to $ 800 million annually in cash, oil and other commodities. A Western economist estimated that <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> needs $ 1 billion to $ 1.5 billion a year for the next four years `` just to keep up its present position.'' The civil war in southern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> is a constant financial drain, as is the huge public sector. For example, the government's railway corporation, which moves less than 10 percent of <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s freight, employs 370,000 people. It moved more than 80 percent of the freight 30 years ago with fewer than half as many people. Government sugar factories produce 600,000 tons of sugar a year, which should satisfy local annual consumption needs of 560,000 tons. Nevertheless, the government imports 200,000 tons a year because 250,000 tons of domestic sugar are smuggled to neighboring countries for higher prices. The International Monetary Fund and other lenders are calling <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> to cut back on such costly ways. The Oxford-educated <PERSON> el-Mahdi </PERSON> said in the interview that one of the first tasks once the new government is formed will be to adopt a four-year economic reform plan. It will include rehabilitation of agricultural, industrial and service institutions and the construction of new roads and dams, he said. Closely linked to the economic morass is the civil war in southern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>, where the rebel <ORGANIZATION> Sudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> has held the upper hand for almost a year, its first sustained success since the conflict began in 1983. The Ethiopian-backed rebels, mainly Christians and animists fighting the Moslem-dominated government in <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION>, demand autonomy and a larger share of <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s assets for the southern zone. They also want Islamic law abrogated. The country is thought to have extensive oil reserves, mostly in the south, but the war prevents exploitation. Southern farms ca n't till their fertile fields because of the fighting and work has been halted on a major canal project, which if completed would divert Nile River water throughout <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>

<TEXT>
 Time after time, the scenario has been replayed in the Asian Subcontinent: the powerful leader falls, sometimes to an assassin's bullet, and beside the body is the grieving wife or daughter. Then, tears brushed away and replaced by determination, she picks up the mantle of power in a part of the world where many women still are sold into marriages or brothels, cast aside for failing to produce sons or consigned to lives of serving men. In the past three decades, several women have emerged as powerful political leaders in this way. They include: _ The late Prime Minister <PERSON> Indira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, rivaled by few men anywhere in the world for iron will and ability to leave an indelible stamp on the fabric of a nation _ <PERSON> Sirimavo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bandaranaike </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>, the world's first woman prime minister and a strong contender to govern her nation once again _ <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, head of the most visible opposition force confronting President <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> ul-Haq </PERSON> _ <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Hasina </PERSON> and <PERSON> Khaleda </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, leaders of the longest sustained opposition protests against any leader of their coup-prone country Each of them has handled power skillfully, although Mrs. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Bandaranaike </PERSON> were doomed by their excesses. Not one of them could be considered a feminist. Each pledged, at least in the beginning, to uphold the ideals of her late father or husband. `` The people feel that the wife is the best to carry on,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bandaranaike </PERSON> says during an interview in the colonnaded home in <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> where Prime Minister S.W.R.D. <PERSON> Bandaranaike </PERSON> was gunned down by a <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monk in 1959. `` They trust the wife to carry on the husband's policies more than anyone else.'' The 72-year-old Mrs. <PERSON> Bandaranaike </PERSON> pauses for a moment, then adds: `` There is a certain amount of sympathy for the widow. You ca n't deny that also helps.'' In Mrs. <PERSON> Bandaranaike </PERSON>'s case, her husband's <ORGANIZATION> Sri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lanka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> was in shambles after his death. The party's men squabbled for nearly a year, then enlisted her to restore unity. She served as prime minister from 1960 to 1965 and again from 1970 to 1977, when voters rebelled against tight economic controls that banned most imports and saw people standing in line for bread. Older and wiser, Mrs. <PERSON> Bandaranaike </PERSON> is ready for office again, and is said to have a good chance of winning elections scheduled for 1989. President <PERSON> Junius </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON>, who defeated Mrs. <PERSON> Bandaranaike </PERSON> in 1977, replaced the parliamentary system with a presidential one and is barred from seeking another term. His <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is under attack for failing to end a four-year war by Tamil guerrillas against the Sinhalese ethnic majority. Mrs. <PERSON> Bandaranaike </PERSON>, like the region's other powerful women, said her sex has not been an issue. Despite being second-class citizens in most South Asian societies, women have a `` market value in the political arena,'' says <PERSON> Ashis </PERSON> <PERSON> Nandy </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>'s Center for the Study of Developing Societies. `` I think there is a very strong substrata of matriarchy in the society,'' he says. It's a cultural phenomenon that transcends the region's dominant religions: <LOCATION> Hinduism </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, Buddhism in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> and Islam in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>. `` Traditionally, in all these societies, femininity has been associated with activism and power,'' says <PERSON> Nandy </PERSON>, who trained as a clinical psychologist before entering political science. He noted that <LOCATION> Hinduism </LOCATION>'s female deities invoke greater fear than male deities. Paintings of <PERSON> Krishna </PERSON> and other gods have a gentle, almost androgynous quality, while <PERSON> Kali </PERSON>, goddess of destruction, is drenched in blood with human heads hanging from her waist _ and is unmistakably female. `` The king of the gods is a man, but the crucial, powerful gods relevant to everyday life are women,'' <PERSON> Nandy </PERSON> says. `` Pestilence, health, child care, fertility: These are goddesses.'' <PERSON> Indira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, daughter of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s first prime minister, <PERSON> Jawaharlal </PERSON> <PERSON> Nehru </PERSON>, was known as `` Bharat Mhata,'' Mother of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. She was loved, hated, feared, but above all respected. She abolished the princely estates of the maharajahs, intervened in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s civil war to create the new nation of <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> in 1971 and led <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> into the nuclear age.

 Mrs. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> was installed as prime minister in 1966 by men who thought she would be pliable. She soon proved them wrong and stayed in office until a crushing election defeat in 1977 when democracy was restored after 20 months of heavy-handed emergency rule. But she rebounded back into office in 1980 and served four more years before she was assassinated by Sikh bodyguards. `` I think being a woman in politics is an asset in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>,'' says <PERSON> Maneka </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, widow of <PERSON> Indira </PERSON>'s younger son, <PERSON> Sanjay </PERSON>, and political foe of the older son, current Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>. `` We treat our country as very feminine, <LOCATION> Mother </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. Of course, I do tend to be patronized. But it's not because I'm a woman but because I'm 31. `` I think most women in this part of the world come up in politics because of family,'' <PERSON> Maneka </PERSON> says. `` But whether they are successful or not really depends on their own qualities.'' In <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, the two major opposition parties trying to force President <PERSON> Hussain </PERSON> <PERSON> Muhammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON> to resign are headed by women, <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Hasina </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Awami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Khaleda </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Bangladesh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Hasina </PERSON>, daughter of assassinated President <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Mujibur </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON>, was tutored in politics from childhood, but Mrs. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> sought a political role only after her husband, President <PERSON> Ziaur </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON>, was assassinated. Both <PERSON> Hasina </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> were installed as party leaders by male politicians who needed someone who could unite the ranks by invoking memories of once-popular presidents. <PERSON> Hasina </PERSON>, in an interview in the house where her father, mother and three brothers were gunned down in 1975, said she believed women leaders have strengths sometimes lacking in men. `` They do n't corrupt very quickly. They can sacrifice more. They are very organized. Women are mothers. They preserve. They nurse,'' says <PERSON> Hasina </PERSON>, 40-year-old mother of two teen-agers and wife of atomic scientist <PERSON> Wazed </PERSON> <PERSON> Miah </PERSON>. The 43-year-old Mrs. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>, whose husband was killed in 1981, professed to see `` no difference between men and women.'' But she added that if her husband had lived, `` there would have been no need for me to be involved in politics.'' Pakistani opposition leader <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> had brothers who also were active in politics, but <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> emerged as the foremost heir of the <ORGANIZATION> Pakistan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> after the 1977 overthrow and subsequent execution of her father, Prime Minister <PERSON> Zulfikar </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>. Returning home from self-imposed exile in 1986, <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> was hailed by adoring masses who thought <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s daughter would lead a `` people's power'' revolution, like the one ignited in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> by President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, widow of a slain opposition leader. Two years later, Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> _ recently married to wealthy businessman-polo player <PERSON> Asif </PERSON> <PERSON> Zardari </PERSON> _ heads a party wracked by infighting among functionaries who accuse her of being dictatorial and abrasive. `` It may be my personality overshadows many events,'' Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, 34, told one of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s national newspapers, the Indian Express. She also said that before she returned home, someone told her that politics was `` a very dirty game'' for a woman. She said she replied, `` Do n't you worry, I will face everything.'' Although women have reached the top echelons of power in the Subcontinent, only <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> routinely places some women in the lower and middle levels of government. <PERSON> Krishna </PERSON> <PERSON> Sahi </PERSON>, one of seven women in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 63-member <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministers </ORGANIZATION>, a sort of expanded cabinet, believes women always played a big role in decision-making in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, but often it was `` from behind the curtain.'' Now, she says, `` awareness has come into women ... They are getting rid of the oppression.'' In south <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, the death last January of movie star-politician M.G. <PERSON> Ramachandran </PERSON>, the leader of <LOCATION> Tamil </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nadu </LOCATION> state, sparked a fierce battle for succession between two women: his 64-year-old widow and his 39-year-old close companion of the last decade. The squabble between <PERSON> Janaki </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramachandran </PERSON>, the widow, and <PERSON> Jayalalitha </PERSON>, who co-starred with <PERSON> Ramachandran </PERSON> in 25 movies, is still going on.

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ Two questions. What was the first human transplant, and which is the most successful? The answer to both is the cornea, which gives sight to 35,000 people a year. The irony is that the very success of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s eye banks has caused their biggest frustration, a lack of donors.

 Their battle cry could properly be `` an eye for an eye.'' But there is no vengeance in the hearts of these crusaders, only mercy. They work in a small, quiet lab high above <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s blare and glare, and, with dawn-to-midnight effort, seem to be gaining on their quest: the gift of sight for all who can have it _ without delay. `` We're providing more corneas for transplant every year,'' says <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Dahl </PERSON>. `` Dramatically more in recent years, but still not enough. `` When I came here seven years ago the waiting period was four months. Now it's down to five weeks. The pity is that there should n't have to be any waiting time at all. The eyes are there, the donors are not.'' Ms. <PERSON> Dahl </PERSON> is the lab director for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Eye-Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Restoration </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. It is the nation's first and largest eye bank among the more than 100 throughout the nation. Last year it provided 1,400 corneas for transplant, all it could obtain, but, as Ms. <PERSON> Dahl </PERSON> said, not enough. The irony is that the very success of corneal transplants, the first human tissue transplanted successfully, is the eye bank's biggest problem `` The large organ transplants, the hearts, the kidneys, the lungs, are the ones that get all the publicity and national appeals for donors,'' says <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>, the eye bank's executive director. `` Corneal transplants have become so commonplace people assume one will be available every time one is needed. That, of course, is far from the case.'' Since its beginning two generations ago, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s eye bank has provided corneas for 30,000 transplants. And, yes, the procedure has become so routine that that number now equals almost as many as are done in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> every year. On an average day in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, one heart, 20 kidneys and 65 corneas are transplanted _ one cornea every 22 minutes, more corneas than all other transplants combined. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> eye bank was established in 1944 by a pioneering physician, the late <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Townley </PERSON> <PERSON> Paton </PERSON>. He used eyes donated by consenting convicts on death row at Sing Sing Prison, just up the <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, and lost a housekeeper in the process when she opened the fridge one morning, saw two eyes in a saucer of liquid, and left. <PERSON> Paton </PERSON>, who died four years ago, wrote the first textbook published in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on corneal transplants, forerunner of all organ transplants. The cornea is not an organ. The eye is the organ, the cornea a tissue. At least at this stage doctors see no way the eye, once severed from the optic nerve, can ever be transplanted. The cornea is the transparent front surface of the eye, about the size and thickness of a dime. It is the window through which light passes to the lens and onto the retina. The brain completes the job; the result, vision. For it all to work, the cornea must be crystal clear. `` It's an amazing thing, the cornea,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Dahl </PERSON>, the lab director. `` It's the most sensitive tissue in the body, which is why the tiniest grain of sand on it will hurt. Yet it also is very resilient, and the fact that it contains no blood vessels makes it easily passed on. Rejection by the recipient is extremely rare. The success rate is better than 90 percent. `` Some recipients who received a transplant when they were young, from a middle-aged or even elderly donor, are looking through corneas perhaps 100 years old.'' Ms. <PERSON> Dahl </PERSON>'s education was in biology and chemistry, not medicine. She got her job at the eye bank through a help-wanted ad and trained on the job. She was certified by the <ORGANIZATION> Eye </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, sort of a national clearinghouse which sets the standards for technicians.

 Her lab is a simply furnished room: no microscopes or bubbling beakers or any of the exotic paraphernalia you might expect in a place where medical miracles are wrought. It contains only a table, brightly lit, where the corneas are removed, and a single instrument called a split-light, a device like one an eye doctor uses for examinations, except less complicated. Ms. <PERSON> Dahl </PERSON>'s eyes -LRB- 20-20, hazel -RRB- brighten with enthusiasm when she explains what goes on there. `` We have four people in the lab and four in the field collecting eyes from donors. As soon as we hear of a donor we dispatch someone to the hospital to collect the eyes. We cover 138 hospitals in an 11-county area. Unlike other organs, the eye can be taken six to eight hours after death. It's a simple job and leaves no disfiguration. Takes about 20 minutes. `` We receive the eyes in the lab and examine the cornea through the split-light. If it is acceptable, we remove it and send it right away to the next recipient on the list. If not, it is used in research. None is wasted. Our procedure takes about 20 minutes as well. `` We maintain the recipient list by computer. The corneas go out first come, first served, unless there's a priority, such as someone being in danger of losing the entire eye because of an accident. `` The doctor removes the damaged portion of the patient's eye with an instrument called a trephine, sort of a cookie cutter. He cuts out the donor cornea with the same instrument, so the replacement fits exactly. He works through a high-powered microscope and stitches it in with nylon thread finer than a human hair. He can do the operation in his office using local anesthesia if he chooses. `` Some patients can see when the bandages come off the next day. With others it's more gradual. `` What we do here is the easy part. The hard part is getting the donors.'' Even many doctors, well aware of the need, are often reluctant to approach a family at the moment of their grief to ask permission to remove their loved one's organs. The result is the loss in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> each year of an estimated 18,000 to 20,000 potential kidneys, livers, hearts, lungs and other organs, but especially eyes. Since the eyes do not have to be removed as urgently, the brain-dead body does not have to be maintained artificially, and the cornea may wait four or five days before transplanting. To prevent this loss, two years ago <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> enacted laws not simply encouraging but requiring that hospitals, where 80 percent of Americans die, make that painful request of the bereaved. Since then all except eight states -LRB- <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> -RRB- have passed similar `` required request'' laws. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, among other states, sends out counselors _ including the energetic Ms. <PERSON> Dahl </PERSON> _ to teach nurses and other hospital workers how to make the delicate request. They have discovered that in many cases the request actually comforts a family since they can feel the relative lives on through someone else. `` There is one final act of love you can do for your beloved,'' one hospital chaplain tells sorrowing relatives. Others approach a relative with a gentle question: `` Do you know whether the person was an eye donor?'' `` Two-thirds of those asked say yes,'' says Ms. <PERSON> Dahl </PERSON>, `` Since the law's enactment, donations to the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> eye bank increased 78 percent.'' Still not enough. A decade ago, only 7,000 corneal transplants were performed in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. But eyes judged beyond repair back then can now be restored. Last year 35,000 Americans received corneal transplants and another 5,000 who needed them lacked donors. Doctors say that technology continues to develop and today's demand could double in the next decade. `` I do n't know whether we ever will have a cornea immediately for everybody who needs one, but that's the goal,'' Ms. <PERSON> Dahl </PERSON> says. `` Until it happens, we'll continue to be a bank in name only. No deposits here, only withdrawals.''

He also found, he says, `` that the ablest kids in the country today never saw anybody governing.'' `` I wrote a memo proposing the idea of a group of <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> fellows and had the idea that it could be financed by foundations,'' he said. `` The only problem was the bill was very high and there was n't any foundation interested in it.''

Today it has a budget of slightly less than $ 500,000 a year, supplemented by private funds raised by a foundation set up by former fellows. In its early years, the program was limited to applicants between the ages of 24 and 36, but the age requirement was abandoned in response to an anti-discrimination suit. All of the current fellows, however, would have qualified under the original limits.

 The youngest fellow in history, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Neuman </PERSON>, was 23 when he served in the White House Office of Cabinet Affairs. <PERSON> Neuman </PERSON> says the experience has been `` very useful and helpful'' in his present job _ vice president for current comedy programs at <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>. `` Relationships between the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and the departments and agencies are much like that between a television network and the various studies and production companies,'' he says. `` The political dynamic is very similar.'' <PERSON> Neuman </PERSON> says the program needs to be better publicized. `` Everybody knows what the Rhodes scholarship is and very few people know what the White House fellowship is.'' Applications are first reviewed at a January reunion of alumni, who cut them to about 130. Those applicants are invited to travel at their own expense to 11 cities to be interviewed by panels of prominent citizens. This cuts the field to 33, who come to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> at government expense for a weekend for more interviews by members of the presidentially appointed <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on White House Fellowships. For some, like <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON>, the interview will be their first trip to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. For others, the capital is familiar ground. <PERSON> Nuzzo </PERSON>, for instance, had been a House page and attended <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Nuzzo </PERSON>, 31, said he heard about the program while in college. After completing medical school and residency, he applied so he could `` decide whether I'm going to be a practicing clinician or whether I wanted to get involved with policy full time.'' He says he reached his decision on his third day in the job: he chose a life of public service. On one recent day, <PERSON> Nuzzo </PERSON> sat in on a meeting of the subcabinet <ORGANIZATION> Interagency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> from 8:30 until sometime after 9:30 a.m., came back to the office and did some reading in the budget and the annual economic report to the president, `` sort of summarized some of the key kernels of material that were necessary from that,'' analyzed some taxation and civil rights issues and `` looked at the whole notion of banking deregulation.'' That was in the morning. In the afternoon, he had a meeting about AIDs financing. Not everybody's cup of tea, but for <PERSON> Nuzzo </PERSON> it's heady stuff. `` Here I am, I'm a doc from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` A couple of months ago my big thing was figuring out whether I ought to give somebody a high colonic, and now I'm writing memoranda for the vice president.'' In addition to their regular duties, the fellows spend at least a day on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> following a member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> around. `` That, from the fellows' point of view, is a real eye opener,'' says <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Lavin </PERSON>, assistant director of the program. `` I think up until then a lot of them have really believed in their government textooks on how it works.'' <PERSON> Drysdale </PERSON>, 32, a general partner in <ORGANIZATION> Hambrecht </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Quist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Venture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, for instance, was assigned to track Rep. E. -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Kika </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- de la <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` There are parts of it that are very, very different from the way decisions are made in the business world,'' <PERSON> Drysdale </PERSON> says. `` Often in business one or two people make a decision; in the political process it's much more open.'' The fellows also attend meetings, about once a week, at which big names in government and journalism speak. They also make trips abroad, which come out of the budget of the agency they work for. This year's group went to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in April. When President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> met with the fellows on Jan. 5, according to <PERSON> Nuzzo </PERSON>, he asked them, `` Please let me know what you find out.'' Although one out of three of the current fellows are from the armed services, officials deny there is any tilt in favor of the military. Whatever their background, said <PERSON> Nuzzo </PERSON>, `` There is almost a White House fellows Mafia of both old and new fellows, people from outside and inside the government who talk to each other a great deal.'' One alumnus of the program, <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Chao </PERSON>, recently named chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maritime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, came to the fellowship from a career in banking, to which she expects to return. `` Being an immigrant to this country, I was personally interested in how the government works,'' the Taiwanese native said. But she added, `` It was only through my business dealings that I began to understand that business and government really did n't understand each other.''

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ Before <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> surged far ahead of the pack, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> was the most talked-about non-candidate for president of this primary season. Here's a look at the statehouse record of <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, who's keeping the door slightly ajar for another `` Mario scenario.''

 <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, one of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s most eloquent voices, has toiled for 5 -LCB- years as chief executive of the nation's second-largest state, much of the time at the center of waxing and waning speculation about a possible run for the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> From his base in <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> has tackled national issues such as the federal deficit; international issues such as Third World debt, and the most basic issue of all _ life and death. `` We do innovation so casually that we do n't even get credit for it,'' says <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, who with one 1984 speech became an instant national celebrity and kept people talking about him as a likely presidential candidate even while he insisted he had no intention of being one. Until recently, <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>'s avowed non-candidacy was regarded with much skepticism. Now the march toward the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> nomination by a fellow governor, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, seems to have all but obliterated lingering thoughts of a `` Mario scenario.'' Whatever <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> might have wrought as a candidate, in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> his handiwork has accumulated and is plain to see _ though not, as usual in matters political, uncontested. A list of administration accomplishments compiled in <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>'s office includes the mandatory seat belt law, the nation's first; the start of the largest tax cut in the state's history, and raising the drinking age from 18 to 21 The seat belt bill originated in the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>, and the governor at first expressed reservations about its effect on `` short people'' who might find wearing the belts uncomfortable. Reminded of this recently, <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said, `` I signed it.'' In 1984, <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> fought hard to raise the state's drinking age, but members of the state <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>'s majority, complaining of the administration's strong-arm lobbying, voted it down. It passed the following year after the federal government threatened to withhold federal highway money from any state that failed to raise its drinking age to 21. The tax cut approved last year was on the Legislature's initiative, says state Assembly Speaker <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> Democrat After initial opposition to the tax-cut proposals, first championed by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> majority, <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> came on board and signed the measure into law. In March, a television reporter noted in a broadcast the critics were saying the governor had n't come up with many new ideas. It's an accusation <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> has heard repeatedly, and it makes him bristle The official keeper of the <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> administration's scorecard, first assistant to the governor <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, sent the reporter a three-page list titled, `` Highlights of Cuomo Administration Innovations.'' Said the governor himself, when asked about initiatives: `` It would probably be difficult to find a five-year period in the history of the state where you had more innovation.'' He cited a string of them. One such was his fight for creation of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to study the national deficit, Third World debt and productivity. With a strong push from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> signed legislation in December creating the commission. `` The governor of a state gets an idea. The vice president does n't want it. The president does n't want it. And we get it. The president signs it. I think that was kind of innovative,'' says <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>. `` That certainly has the sound, if not'88, then 1992,'' says <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>'s chief <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION> antagonist, <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, the Republican majority leader of the state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, suggesting that <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> has his sights set on the White House. The commission, derisively labeled `` the <ORGANIZATION> Cuomo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>'' by Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, this year's expected <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential nominee, is composed of luminaries such as <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> financial expert <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Rohatyn </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON>. Co-chaired by former <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> and <PERSON> Republican </PERSON> <PERSON> Drew </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, a former secretary of transportation, the commission will report after the November election. A real <ORGANIZATION> Cuomo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> is the governor's <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Competitiveness </ORGANIZATION>, a group of nationally known executives, labor leaders and economists brought together by the governor to study the same problems as they affect <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.

 Among other things, <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>'s commission has recommended the creation of industry task forces to adjust to new technologies and foreign competition. Worker participation would be expanded to increase productivity and corporations would be granted trade relief, but only if they produced plans to revitalize their production. The commission has also suggested consideration of a 5 percent value-added tax to reduce imports, stimulate exports and cut the deficit. Other initiatives that <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> alone can take credit for include: _ At his insistence, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> became the first state in the nation to create a Task Force on Life and the Law The group of theologians, lawyers, physicians, scientists and civil rights activists has come up with a legally acceptable definition of death _ the absence of brain activity _ and legislation that permits people to refuse intrusive medical efforts that might prolong their lives. The task force is also studying surrogate parent contracts and policies for organ transplants. _ <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> has begun a program using schools as community centers that provide care for students after regular school hours and he's proposed <ORGANIZATION> Liberty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scholarships </ORGANIZATION>, a plan that would guarantee poor seventh graders a public college education if they stay in school and get accepted into a _ He has secured passage of major bond issues for environmental work and for rebuilding the state's decaying roads and bridges _ <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> persuaded the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> to establish a state-subsidized prescription drug program for the elderly, to adopt a fiscal strategy that will gradually reduce the state's recurring short-term debt, and to approve legislation that would allow victims of long-ago exposure to toxic substances to sue for damages _ <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> has used his executive powers to create an inspector general's office to ferret out corruption in state agencies; to adopt regulations that insure against race, sex or sexual-preference discrimination by the state, and to improve productivity in state government _ In the wake of corruption scandals in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and allegations of wrongdoing by state legislators, he also battled bitterly with the leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> last year to win new laws to police the conduct of elected and appointed officials A <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION> poll of the nation's governors, conducted two years ago, rated <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, as the `` most effective'' governor. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> was eighth. `` It's a question of communication,'' <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> says. `` If I had said for five years what <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is now saying. If I had said for five years, ` I want to be known as the education governor' and just done all the things we've done for five years, I would now be nationally regarded as an education governor. I did n't do that. The programs and substance are there, but I never identified it as the thing we wished to be known for.'' Fellow Democrat <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, who has not always been on good relations with <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, suggests another theory. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION>'s economy has been healthy and `` the money has flowed in,'' he says `` Your ultimate test is always in emergencies; you can be great if there are no emergencies.'' He does n't think <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>'s has been `` a peculiarly innovative administration.'' But he says <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> has borrowed ideas freely from the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> and other states and `` somebody who takes the best of what's around is smart.'' Ultimately, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> says, the governor `` is result-minded and compromise-minded'' _ a real strength but also a weakness `` because sometimes you let a lot of stuff go.'' But getting things done is what counts, <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> argues: `` The governor is the quarterback. He has to get you across the goal line.'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> says the governor has yet `` to get ahead of the game'' in dealing with the mentally ill, the retarded, the homeless, housing. And, Democrat <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> and Republican <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> say, he has n't consistently appointed top-flight officials Both praise his ability as a communicator. As for the 55-year-old governor, he says he loves his job and is making plans to run for a third four-year term in 1990. He is careful nonetheless not to commit himself to seek re-election, or to close the door completely on a presidential bid in 1992 should the Democrats lose this year. `` Only God knows what's going to happen,'' he says.

Today, 42 years later, some 1,500 Bikinians are scattered across the <LOCATION> Marshall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, living on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid and waiting for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to fulfill its promise and clean up their homeland.

 <PERSON> Kilon </PERSON> <PERSON> Bauno </PERSON> looks out on the lagoon that once provided his people an abundant life and recalls those better days, before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> atomic bomb tests poisoned this remote, coral atoll with radiation. `` When I was here, life was great. We had fish, we had turtles, we had coconuts. We lived together and we took care of each other,'' Bauno, the ceremonial chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Bikini </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islanders </ORGANIZATION>, says through an interpreter. `` You always felt you were getting a big gift from God,'' adds <PERSON> Bauno </PERSON>, who is believed to be in his late 80s, although elderly Bikinians do n't keep track of their ages. Today, 42 years after 167 Bikinians left so their atoll could become a laboratory for the bomb tests, they see a glimmer of hope that their `` nuclear exile'' will be coming to an end. Under an out-of-court settlement to a lawsuit in 1985, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> agreed to pay for Bikini's cleanup and the eventual resettlement of the atoll. Scientists are still trying to determine how best to get rid of the lingering radiation. However, it's no longer a question of `` if'' the exiles can return home, but when. An estimated 1,500 Bikinians are scattered throughout the <LOCATION> Marshall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, living off aid from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government and longing for the day when <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> fulfills its promise. `` When we left, they promised us we would be the children of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bauno </PERSON> says. `` The only thing we can do now is look to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and wait for them to do something.'' So far, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has spent $ 123 million on the Bikinians, including $ 95 million in trust funds to resettle, house and feed them. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> also has paid for studies of the radiation problem in the atoll, site of 23 atomic blasts between 1946 and 1958. With each passing day the elder Bikinians believe the chances of resuming their traditional way of life become slimmer. `` There are only a few elders left who know our traditional customs and it will not be long until they are gone also,'' says <PERSON> Tomaki </PERSON> <PERSON> Juda </PERSON>, mayor of <LOCATION> Kili </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, which has the largest population of Bikinians. `` We hope it will not be long before we can restore our traditions.'' The Bikinians, described in 1946 as a primitive fishing people, now enjoy a lifestyle they could n't have imagined 42 years ago. With American dollars they have bought Western-style clothes, TV sets, videotape recorders and even cars. But <PERSON> Bauno </PERSON> and his fellow elders say those comforts are only sedatives to ease the pain of their exile. Some 700 of the Bikinians now live on <LOCATION> Kili </LOCATION>, a 200-acre island 500 miles south of Bikini which was uninhabited when they arrived. Unlike Bikini, whose 23 remaining islands enclose a 240-square-mile lagoon teeming with fish, <PERSON> Kili </PERSON> is an isolated coconut island pounded by heavy surf. A $ 6 million trust fund provides each Bikinian about $ 30 a month, giving them a higher standard of living than most Marshallese. The Bikinians depend on canned meat and surplus food provided by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government to supplement the coconuts and breadfruit grown on <LOCATION> Kili </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid has provided the Bikinians plywood houses, electricity and medical care. The Bikinians also have built what local pilots call the best airstrip in the Marshalls outside of <LOCATION> Majuro </LOCATION>, the capital.

 `` Some people call them rich, but a <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> and a plywood house is n't rich,'' says <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Niedenthal </PERSON>, an American who is an adviser and interpreter for the Bikinians. While the Bikini elders try to keep tradition alive on <LOCATION> Kili </LOCATION>, the American influence is strong. Some of the 100 children attending <PERSON> Kili </PERSON>'s three-building school have first names such as Rambo, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Norris </PERSON>. A popular activity on <PERSON> Kili </PERSON> is to drive one of the island's 30-odd Japanese cars at midday with the air conditioner running _ an event they call `` jumbo. `` The cars are a way of taking away the burden of living on <LOCATION> Kili </LOCATION>,'' says <PERSON> Mayor </PERSON> <PERSON> Juda </PERSON>. `` Getting in a car and riding around gives you a feeling of not being so stuck, even though driving from one end of <PERSON> Kili </PERSON> to the other takes only a couple of minutes.'' Twenty police officers take turns patrolling <PERSON> Kili </PERSON>'s two miles of dirt road in a pickup truck equipped with a $ 15 dollar siren. Police hand out tickets of up to $ 25 for offenses ranging from running one of the island's dozen stop signs to exceeding the 5 mph speed limit established in the island's living area. The greatest thrill for the Bikinians is when the elders return to check the progress of work at Bikini. The latest trip was made in early April, when 50 joined <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials to mark the start of construction of a $ 30 million base camp once the method of cleaning Bikini is agreed upon. The Bikinians and their <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> attorney, <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Weisgall </PERSON>, continue to lobby the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government for money for the cleanup and resettlement, which is expected to cost between $ 120 million and $ 215 million. So far, the government has appropriated a few hundred thousand dollars to begin construction of the base camp, <PERSON> Weisgall </PERSON> says. <PERSON> Weisgall </PERSON> has proposed that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government establish another trust fund that would allow the Bikinians pay for the resettlement themselves. The plan, which <PERSON> Weisgall </PERSON> said would involve a commitment of about $ 100 million, has received support from some congressional leaders and from <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> of the Department of the Interior, the Bikini project officer. `` I think all our problems can be addressed and resolved by a trust fund,'' <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> says. `` The trust fund we think puts the responsibility on the Bikinians themselves rather than bureaucrats in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.'' For the past 10 years, American scientists have studied the radiation problem on the main island of Bikini, whose soil is laced with radioactive cesium-137 from the explosion of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s most powerful hydrogen bomb in 1954. The researchers say it will take between five and 10 years to clean <LOCATION> Bikini </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, where most of the Bikinians will live. Scientists say that without treatment locally grown food wo n't be safe until well into the 21st century They are considering three cleanup alternatives: removing the topsoil in which the radioactive material is concentrated, treating the soil with potassium to prevent the uptake of radioactivity by plants and irrigation with sea water. For now, the Bikinians remain at the mercy of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` They give us a little money and we buy our food,'' <PERSON> Bauno </PERSON> says. `` Then we stare at them again and they give us a little more. `` That's all we can do. We just look to these Americans, saying, ` Continue helping us because we're still away from where we want to be.'''

<DATELINE>BIKINI ATOLL, Marshall Islands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Scientists have once again descended upon <PERSON> Bikini </PERSON> <PERSON> Atoll </PERSON>, this time to find a way to remove radiation that lingers from atomic bomb tests and bring the <ORGANIZATION> Bikini </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islanders </ORGANIZATION> home to stay. Twenty-three atomic tests between 1946 and 1958 turned <ORGANIZATION> Bikini </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atoll </ORGANIZATION> into a radioactive no-man's land. Three of Bikini's 26 islands were vaporized. The enemy on <LOCATION> Bikini </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, where most of the resettled Bikinians would live, is radioactive cesium-137. The isotope fouled Bikini's soil after the explosion of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s most powerful hydrogen bomb in 1954. The cesium has made its way into the island's food plants, and scientists say that without treatment locally grown food wo n't be safe until well into the 21st century. `` If we solve the cesium-uptake problem, we've essentially solved the whole problem of rehabilitating Bikini,'' according to Dr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Robison </PERSON>, a scientist at <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Lawrence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Livermore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> who has been heading field tests here. <PERSON> Robison </PERSON> says researchers have come up with three alternatives for making Bikini safe: scraping up the topsoil in which the radioactive material is concentrated, treating the soil with potassium to prevent the uptake of radioactivity by plants, and irrigation with sea water. Removing the topsoil on the 500-acre island is the most straightforward approach, and also is the most expensive alternative, <PERSON> Robison </PERSON> says. The <ORGANIZATION> Bikini </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atoll </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rehabilitation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, set up by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to study the radiation problem, determined that removing the topsoil would cost as much as $ 96 million. To be effective, the removal would have to take the top 16 inches of soil off <LOCATION> Bikini </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Robison </PERSON> says. Such a procedure would be `` a serious environmental insult,'' removing all Bikini's plants and devastating the island's ability to grow vegetation `` In addition to all the cesium, it's going to remove all the topsoil that contains all the nutrients that carry all the organic material it's taken decades to build up,'' <PERSON> Robison </PERSON> says. Workers removed plutonium from <ORGANIZATION> Enewetak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atoll </ORGANIZATION>, another nuclear test site in the <LOCATION> Marshall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, by scraping the topsoil. Drenching topsoil with sea water has drastically reduced cesium uptake in test plants, <PERSON> Robison </PERSON> says, but scientists are unsure of its long-term effectiveness. There also is some question about how much damage the salt water would inflict upon plants. Researchers believe the sea water treatment works in one of two ways: either electrically charged sodium particles block the cesium from entering plant roots or the water filters the cesium further into the soil and out of the reach of plants. <PERSON> Robison </PERSON> favors a third approach, which involves saturating the soil with potassium. Cesium is closely related to potassium, which plants crave. Scientists believe plants mistake the cesium for potassium, which is rare in Bikini's coral soil. <PERSON> Robison </PERSON> says plants prefer potassium to cesium and will absorb potassium if given a choice between the two. The salt water and potassium treatments control the radioactive cesium, leaving it in the soil until natural decay renders it harmless. The cost of both options is estimated at between $ 57 million and $ 80 million. The scaping option, although frowned upon by scientists, has won wide support among Bikini's leaders, even though it means staying away from their home longer. The Bikinians like the fact that soil removal gets rid of the cesium, instead of simply controlling it until it loses its potency. `` It's the position of the <LOCATION> Bikinian </LOCATION> people that the radioactive soil be scraped up,'' says <PERSON> Henchi </PERSON> <PERSON> Balos </PERSON>, a senator representing the Bikinians. `` As laymen, it's the only way we can have our peace of mind.'' A small group of Bikinians returned in the early 1970s when radiation levels were thought to be safe. But tests in 1978 found they were ingesting dangerous amounts of cesium and they were evacuated. <PERSON> Tomaki </PERSON> <PERSON> Juda </PERSON>, mayor of <LOCATION> Kili </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> where some 700 Bikinians now live, says <PERSON> Bikini </PERSON>'s leaders favor the scraping method in part because of the experience in the 1970s. `` President <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said it was safe to come back after they supposedly did a cleanup,'' <PERSON> Juda </PERSON> says. `` We came back here and 10 years later we got moved off again. That makes it hard for us to believe them now.'' <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Weisgall </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> attorney representing the Bikinians, says the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should abide by the Bikinians' wishes `` There's a very strong psychological factor at work here, and if the Bikinians are not convinced Bikini is safe, I'm not convinced they're going to go back,'' he says.

 Convicted murderer <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Gholar </PERSON> owes his freedom and a well-paying job to <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>'s resumption of an old Southern tradition, using prison inmates as servants in the antebellum Governor's Mansion. Only prisoners convicted of violent crimes qualify to serve the state's first family and inmates facing life sentences are preferred, says <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nix </PERSON>, director of executive security at the mansion. `` They tend to make the best workers,'' <PERSON> Nix </PERSON> says, explaining that the `` lifers'' have the most to gain if they do n't betray the governor's trust. For four years, <PERSON> Gholar </PERSON> whipped up everything from gourmet French sauces to down-home cornbread in the kitchen of the white-pillored Governor's Mansion, built in 1842. When Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Allain </PERSON> left office last January, he kept the tradition of commuting the sentences of his faithful servants, and <PERSON> Gholar </PERSON> is now on the payroll of a <LOCATION> Hazlehurst </LOCATION> oil company owner he met while at the mansion. <PERSON> Gholar </PERSON>, a 42-year-old former oil field worker, recalls serving time at the isolated state penitentiary at <LOCATION> Parchman </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delta </LOCATION>. `` I've been behind those walls and fences,'' he says `` You go to <LOCATION> Parchman </LOCATION> and you think that that's it. But it is n't if you try to improve yourself.'' He's now working as a general repairman at <ORGANIZATION> Hood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> offices in <LOCATION> Hazlehurst </LOCATION>, but <PERSON> Gholar </PERSON>'s employer says he plans to train him to become a manager of one of the Hood convenience stores `` The program at the mansion gives you a chance to prove yourself,'' <PERSON> Gholar </PERSON> says. `` Everybody ai n't against you. They'll trust you. <PERSON> Gholar </PERSON> was sentenced to life in prison for the 1981 fatal shooting of the woman he lived with in the small southern <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Prentiss </LOCATION>. He claimed he shot her in self defense. <PERSON> Gholar </PERSON> had no previous criminal record. But no matter how good his behavior at <LOCATION> Parchman </LOCATION>, Gholar probably would have stayed behind bars much longer than the minimum 10 years before he became eligible for parole if he had n't been selected for the mansion post, says his new employer, <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Hood </PERSON>. Hood is good friend of <PERSON> Allain </PERSON>'s and visited the mansion often. He's also on the state <ORGANIZATION> Parole </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Gholar </PERSON> was among the four mansion servants whose sentences were commuted in January: Two for murder and two for manslaughter. <PERSON> Nix </PERSON>, who has been at the mansion since 1965, says some previous governors had as many as eight inmates. Newly inaugurated Gov. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Mabus </PERSON> has four inmates cooking, cleaning and doing other odd jobs. The inmates live in a trailer behind the mansion. Because of the housing situation, only male inmates qualify for the program, <PERSON> Nix </PERSON> says. Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Waller </PERSON> was the only <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> governor in recent years to decline to use prison trusties. A 1977 book co-authored by <PERSON> Waller </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON>, and <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> history professor <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Sansing </PERSON>, `` A History of the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> Governor's Mansion,'' explains how the tradition of commuting the sentences of the mansion trusties began. In 1912, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> voters elected <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Leroy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brewer </PERSON> governor and <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Bilbo </PERSON>, who later became governor and kingpin of state politics for many years, lieutenant governor. The administration was rife with political intrigue and <PERSON> Bilbo </PERSON> was indicted. According to the book: `` During the sensational bribery trial stemming from charges against <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Bilbo </PERSON> and his law partner, G.A. <PERSON> Hobbs </PERSON>, a series of anonymous threats against Gov. <PERSON> Brewer </PERSON> and his family forced the governor to take special precautions to protect his family.'' <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Trott </PERSON>, one of the trusties on duty at the mansion, was assigned to guard <PERSON> Brewer </PERSON>'s 6-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Claudia </PERSON>, against the possibility of kidnapping. For several weeks <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> accompanied the small child whenever she left the mansion. `` Sometime later,'' the book says, `` Gov. <PERSON> Brewer </PERSON> discovered a note under his dinner plate. In his young daughter's scribbled hand the note read simply: ` Please set <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> free.''' Although inmates had been used as servants at the Governor's Mansion throughout <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>'s history, the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> passed a resolution in 1912 allowing the governor a small allowance for the prisoners' food and clothing `` Customarily, only Negro prisoners who had been convicted of murder committed in passion were selected ...'' <PERSON> Waller </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sansing </PERSON> wrote. `` Beginning with Gov. <PERSON> Brewer </PERSON> and continuing through his successors, the inmates received an executive pardon following their service at the mansion. Partly due to the new pattern of race relations in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and in part due to general prison reform, and in spite of its record of success, the practice was discontinued in the <PERSON> Waller </PERSON> administration.'' The practice was resumed when Gov. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Winter </PERSON> succeeded <PERSON> Waller </PERSON> in 1980. Several Southern states have used inmates in their governors' mansions in the past But <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Travisono </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, says he doubts more than a few governors have convicted murderers as servants today. As Hood notes, recent governors see no racial problem with the mansion program. The majority of the <LOCATION> Parchman </LOCATION> prisoners are black, so it's only logical that most of the mansion inmates also are black, he says. Gholar is black, but feels anything but a racial slight for being selected as a mansion servant. He's just glad it has removed the stigma of being an inmate. `` That's not me,'' <PERSON> Gholar </PERSON> says. `` I ai n't <LOCATION> Parchman </LOCATION> material.''

 <PERSON> JoBeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> says that playing the role of surrogate mother <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> in a new TV miniseries altered her views about the controversial `` Baby M'' case. The miniseries `` Baby M,'' which <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> will televise Sunday and Monday, tells the story of what turned into a historic custody battle between <LOCATION> Whitehead </LOCATION> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> and <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>. <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> homemaker, signed a contract three years ago to bear a child for the Sterns. When the baby was born she could not give the child away, and fought to keep her daughter. The Sterns were awarded custody, but a <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> recently granted broad visitation rights to <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Beth </PERSON>, who in the meantime was divorced and remarried and uses the name <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> <PERSON> Gould </PERSON>. She is also pregnant again. The four-hour miniseries is an unauthorized show done without any input from <LOCATION> Whitehead </LOCATION> or the Sterns. `` You would have to get all the rights or you'd have to tell it from one viewpoint,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> says. She said <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> declined to cooperate if the <PERSON> Sterns </PERSON> participated. `` Before I became involved my sympathy more or less was with the Sterns,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> says. `` But as I played <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> I began to see her point of view. I found myself more torn. When I began to see the kind of pain both sides went through it became less easy for me to make a judgment. `` In the beginning, from what I had seen in the media, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> had done some very extreme things. I could n't understand some of her behavior. The more I got into it the more I began to see the kind of stress she was under and how she could do these things.'' Eight months of preparation and research went into the making of the series. `` There is an enormous amount of material available on the case,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> says. `` I had followed the story in the papers and on TV, but I did n't know any details. But like everyone else in the country, I was fascinated by it.'' `` Baby M'' also stars <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Weitz </PERSON> as <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Beth </PERSON>'s husband; <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Shea </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Strasser </PERSON> as the <LOCATION> Sterns </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> as <PERSON> Lorraine </PERSON> <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON>, the legal guardian appointed to protect the baby's interests; <PERSON> Dabney </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> as <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Skoloff </PERSON>, <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>'s attorney; <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> McGill </PERSON> as <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Cassiday </PERSON>, <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON>'s attorney; and <PERSON> Dakin </PERSON> <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON> as the trial judge, <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sorkow </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadwith </PERSON> wrote and directed. `` I think people are not aware of the number of people in this country with fertility problems,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> says. `` I was sympathetic to the Sterns because of that.'' Later, she says, `` I'm a woman who very much wants a child. I think <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> subconsciously really wanted the baby ... Running away with the baby is something I can relate to. Her maternal feelings were very strong.'' The <PERSON> Sterns </PERSON> signed a contract in January 1985 to pay <LOCATION> Whitehead </LOCATION> $ 10,000 to become pregnant with semen from Stern by artificial insemination. She agreed to carry the child to full term and turn it over to the Sterns at birth. Mrs. <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> suffers from multiple sclerosis and pregnancy would have been too great a risk for her. <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> at the time was the mother of two children. This is the fourth time <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> has played a real person. She was <PERSON> Reve </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> in `` Adam'' and again in `` Adam: His Song Continues'' _ as the mother of the child who was kidnapped and murdered in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. In `` Murder Ordained,'' she was <PERSON> Lorna </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, who is now serving a prison sentence for her involvement in the deaths of her husband and the wife of her lover, who was a minister in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>. `` It's different when you play a real person,'' she says. `` You sort of work in a different way. When you play a fictional character you can let your imagination run free. You can find your own parameters. `` When you play a real person you start with the physical things and look for the emotional links. Then you have to find the things that support those emotions. You work backward. It's more challenging. I would certainly never do an imitation, but you do try to capture the essence.'' Before `` Baby M,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> completed `` Memories of Me'' with <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Crystal </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>. She describes it as a serious story, but adds, `` When you get <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> together you're going to have a comedy.'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, is best noted for such movies as `` The Big Chill,'' `` Stir Crazy,'' `` <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON>,'' `` Poltergeist'' and `` Teachers.'' This September, she and <PERSON> Kris </PERSON> <PERSON> Kristofferson </PERSON> will star in `` Passage,'' to be directed by <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaffner </PERSON>. She plays a woman who has long believed her husband was killed in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> _ until the day he comes home. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' husband is <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Pasquin </PERSON>, who specializes in directing pilots. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> says she would do a series herself if the right script came along. She has turned down a few that have gone on to become very successful.

 When <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> Fountain </PERSON> was 9 years old, he joined a gospel troupe called the Happyland Jubilee Singers. Nearly 50 years later, he is still praising the Lord in song. He and the group, now called <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> Fountain </PERSON> and the Five Blind Boys of <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, are appearing in the musical `` The Gospel at Colonus.'' The show sets Sophocles' tale of Oedipus the King within the framework of a black Pentecostal church service and its rousing gospel music. `` I learned most of my gospel singing in school,'' says Fountain, sitting backstage at Broadway's Lunt-Fontanne Theater where `` Colonus'' is playing. His school, which went from grades one through 12, was the <ORGANIZATION> Talladega </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> for the Deaf and <PERSON> Blind </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Talladega </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>. Fountain, who has been blind since he was 2, sang in the school choir, but gospel music was a part of his life even before that His father was a steward in a Methodist church in <LOCATION> Selma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION> `` I was the only one in the family who sang, though,'' he says. `` It became something that grows on you.'' The Happyland Jubilee Singers continued to perform after Fountain and the other members left school early to perform during the mid-1940s. In 1947, they moved to <LOCATION> Chattanooga </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, where they had a 15-minute gospel broadcast each weekday at 6:45 a.m. The name `` Five Blind Boys of <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>'' was born the following year, courtesy of a <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, promoter who began to manage the troupe. The Blind Boys would play one-night stands, all over the country, appearing in schools, churches and auditoriums. They eventually worked their way up to such places as the Apollo Theater and <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, and made a lot of records. One of their songs, `` Precious Lord, Take My Hand,'' was a best seller in 1953. `` It was a touching song,'' Fountain recalls. `` People responded.'' `` We always sang gospel,'' Fountain says. `` That was the big thing. You could n't sing rock' n' roll and then turn around and sing gospel. People would n't follow you. `` A lot of those people singing rock' n' roll, started by singing gospel in church. People like <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooke </PERSON> and <PERSON> Aretha </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>. There were a lot of them. That's why they can sing it so good.'' Today, <PERSON> Fountain </PERSON> says, there is a contemporary gospel sound, religious music that has a rock' n' roll beat. The Five Blind Boys have adapted to it. `` You have to keep up with the style,'' Fountain says. `` If you do n't keep up with the style, you're automatically behind the times.'' Fountain writes some of the group's songs with <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>, who plays guitar for the troupe. `` Writing songs is just like writing a poem,'' Fountain says. `` As long as it rhymes and comes out right, you can take any poem and turn it into a song.'' If Fountain gets an idea for a song, he turns it over in his head, memorizes it and then tells <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> who writes it down. It was through <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> that Fountain and the Blind Boys met composer <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Telson </PERSON> and director <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Breuer </PERSON>, the creators of `` The Gospel at Colonus.'' `` They had the lyrics and the tunes but they did n't have the ingredients to go along with it,'' <PERSON> Fountain </PERSON> says. `` It's just like cookin' bread. You got the bread but you do n't have the salt, so it do n't taste like bread. We put the salt in.'' The show has played at the <ORGANIZATION> Walker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> and in 1983 at the <ORGANIZATION> Brooklyn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Music </ORGANIZATION> as well as all over <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> before tackling Broadway. `` The Gospel at Colonus'' stars actor <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> who narrates the church service, and it features several other gospel groups, such as <PERSON> J.J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> and the Soul Stirrers and the J.D. <ORGANIZATION> Steele </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Singers </ORGANIZATION>. But the Blind Boys get to sing in the evening's two show-stopping numbers, `` No Never'' and `` Lift Me Up.'' They bring down the house. `` It's easier to do than a concert,'' Fountain says. `` With a concert, you do n't rest. You have to really get down. In the musical, we get a chance to breathe a little.'' Today, <PERSON> Fountain </PERSON>, who has been married three times, makes his home in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. The rest of the <ORGANIZATION> Blind </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boys </ORGANIZATION> live all over the country, from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. Before a concert tour starts, they all meet to rehearse their material and then hit the road. Fountain and the Rev. <PERSON> Olice </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> are the only original members of the group still performing. `` We all have good ears,'' he says. `` If it does n't sound right, we just leave it alone. We all agree on one thing. If it sounds good to us, we cut a record. `` My dream was to sing to the masses of people and when this play came along that was my dream. And it's happening just like I dreamed it would. We've come a long way. From the sticks to Broadway.''

<TEXT>
 Thirteen years after the Vietnam War, non-communist <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> is taking in the welcome mat for Vietnamese boat people, casting them off into a sea of uncertainty. A recent rise in the wave of fleeing Vietnamese is largely responsible for the new get-tough policies and brings to a boil the long-simmering problem: what to do with people nobody, including <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> itself, seems to want? Southeast Asians maintain that many Vietnamese are fleeing these days not because of political persecution but because of deteriorating economic conditions at home. The solution, some officials believe, might be to send them back. People found to have fled because of political persecution do qualify for asylum and eventual resettlement elsewhere. Since the end of the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> War in 1975, neighboring nations have offered temporary asylum to fleeing Vietnamese with the understanding they would be accepted by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and other Western countries. About 600,000 boat people have found new homes since the war, according to <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> statistics. But officials in the region now talk of `` compassion fatigue'' throughout the world so that resettlement does not keep up with the tide of new boat people entering cramped refugee camps. `` What we're finding now is that horrifying phrase, ` compassion fatigue,' is all too true,'' Sir <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, the governor of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, told a recent news conference. `` Whereas we have a continuous flow of Vietnamese refugees coming here, the resettlement countries are not prepared to take so many.'' Under that pressure, the policy of offering temporary asylum to all boat people is crumbling in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> and being re-evaluted in the British colony of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. Earlier this year, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> pushed back to sea Vietnamese boats attempting to land, and several deaths were reported. The new policy brought sharp international criticism. The Thais backed off and reopened its doors but insisted the new arrivals would no longer be eligible for resettlement. <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> recently announced it will begin turning away boat people at some unspecified future date. `` Nobody wants to be hard-hearted about the issue, turning away helpless people to take their chances again with the elements and pirates, but <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> can not afford to provide indefinite shelter for thousands of refugees,'' <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Straits </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> newspaper of <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> said in a recent editorial. In <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, legislators angrily demand the colony no longer offer asylum, while the government seeks elusive alternatives to the current policy that will not result in turning away boat people in unseaworthy craft. Vietnamese boat people began appearing in 1975 but not until four years later did they turn into a human tide. Southeast Asian nations agreed on the temporary asylum policy in 1979, when more than 200,000 boat people poured out of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and were presumed to be fleeing political persecution in their homeland, which now was under a Communist regime. The world opened its arms and most of refugees were resettled within a few years. According to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refugees </ORGANIZATION>, Vietnamese boat people arrivals in the region declined annually from nearly 75,000 in 1981 to about 20,000 in 1986. The number of refugees resettled also declined during that period but always exceeded the number of newcomers. Last year, however, boat people arrivals shot up 30 percent to about 28,000 while resettlement totals declined slightly to about 21,000, the High Commission said. Some countries reported a sharp increase in arrivals this year. As of May 2, more than 2,400 boat people sailed into <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, more than five times the total from the same period a year earlier. About 40,000 boat people were languishing in the region's refugee camps by the end of March, a 27 percent increase from the year earlier, according to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> statistics Nearly 34,000 were in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. Resettlement also was up in the first quarter from the same period last year, but still was not keeping pace with new arrivals, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> statistics showed. One reason why boat people now receive frosty receptions is the widely held view that many are fleeing <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> not for fear of persecution but to improve their economic conditions. `` Those now coming are not the traditional boat people,'' said one official in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>'s capital. `` Most are looking for better economic opportunity.'' Many officials in the region believe the only long-term solution is repatriation for such people. `` I think everybody would agree that a solution that provides for repatriation would be the answer,'' said <PERSON> Fazlul </PERSON> <PERSON> Karim </PERSON>, the leading <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> refugee official in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. `` The problem is we do not have any workable solution yet.'' The main hurdle, officials say, lies in getting the Vietnamese government in <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> to take its boat people back. So far, they say, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has agreed on a case-by-case basis to take back the limited number of people who had volunteered to return. Vietnamese officials maintain that boat people are leaving because they are disaffected and that there is no point in taking them back because they wuld only try to leave again because of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s economic conditions. While <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> says its inability to recover from the war and the paucity of Western economic help may be responsible for these conditions, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> governor, places the blame on <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>. `` The government of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> bears a very heavy responsibility for the appalling situation in which thousands of people continue to risk their lives at sea to get away,'' he said. Even if <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> were to allow the return of boat people, says the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Karim </PERSON>, a system would be needed to screen the economic migrants to be repatriated from genuine political refugees. The Southeast Asian nations also would have to decide what to do about the boat people who have received temporary asylum but remain in refugee camps pending resettlement. The next likely step for the Southeast Asian nations is to seek a long-term regional solution. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations, made up of <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brunei </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, will discuss the refugee situation in June at a meeting also to be attended by <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>.

 They are not soldiers but they live in military barracks; they are not prisoners, but guards watch over them. Soldiers and prisoners usually know when their terms are up, but the 2,000 or so Vietnamese boat people at this camp have little idea when they will find a home. They are not allowed to leave the prison-like camp in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s rural <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Territories </LOCATION>, about 500 miles northeast of the homeland they fled, until the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> arranges for their permanent resettlement elsewhere. For some refugees, the wait already has lasted a decade and the effects of lengthy confinement are reflected on their blank faces. A woman sitting on the top deck of a three-tiered bunk bed stares into space; a man stands motionless outside his barracks. Children who have known no other life run and play. For all the refugees, the matless wooden bunks are the center of their lives. Family pictures, calendars, clothes and other belongings are packed nearby. No one knows how long they will remain. Some meticulously count the days they've been here. `` Nine months and 19 days,'' said <PERSON> Pham </PERSON> <PERSON> My </PERSON> <PERSON> Linh </PERSON>, 29. `` You do n't understand what it's like in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>,'' she said in explaining why she's doing it. `` There are wars in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and all 17-year-olds have to join the army.'' She was happy this day because she had an interview with a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation the day before, although she received no promises of going to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Another refugee, 17-year-old <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Thi </PERSON> <PERSON> Luyen </PERSON>, left <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> five years ago. Her mother and brothers had planned to leave with her but could not find space on the boat. `` I do n't know why I'm here,'' she said. `` I was only 12 -LRB- when I left -RRB-. Everybody left so I left.'' Miss <PERSON> Le </PERSON> said she is willing to return to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> to rejoin her family but dares not ask about doing so. `` Some people have applied to go back in 1984 but were refused,'' she said. Despair also is widespread in the many other camps dotting <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. Two Vietnamese refugees recently hanged themselves, one in a <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> camp and another in <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>. One had complained of being in the camp too long and going nowhere; the other reportedly missed his family in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Fierce fighting is overwhelming foreign relief efforts in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s drought-stricken north, where more than 3 million people are threatened with starvation. The government expelled foreign aid workers and withdrew from much of the northern provinces of <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tigre </LOCATION>, where rebels are waging war against <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s Marxist-led government in <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION>. The government now forbids food distribution to the regions, leaving as many as 2 million people beyond the reach of the foreign emergency aid. A limited emergency operation continues through the government's <ORGANIZATION> Relief </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rehabilitation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and a consortium of Christian and indigenous groups organized under the Joint Relief Project After intervention by a special <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> envoy, the government allowed <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> personnel to return to the area where they coordinate the relief effort's trucking and airlift operations. But officials say that, at most, only 1.5 million people can be reached under current conditions and of that number, just 1 million now are being fed. Overall, an estimated 3.2 million people are in danger of starvation and depend on food aid following near-total crop failures last year. `` We've got a lot of people who are not going to get food,'' said <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Johns </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relief </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, the primary coordinator of the Joint Relief Project's food distribution efforts. Relief officials and diplomats are expecting hungry peasants to migrate from the cut-off areas. All aid officials interviewed in <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION> said such a mass movement almost certainly would create huge hunger camps like those of <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s famine of 1984-86, when diseases caused by overcrowding and unsanitary conditions accounted for many of the estimated 1 million deaths then. This time, people arriving at food distribution centers still looked relatively healthy when the foreign aid workers were expelled, said <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, which has employed about half of the foreigners working in the northern relief effort. However, he and others said the peasants' health could deteriorate rapidly unless they get food. `` We're talking about people who ca n't wait days or weeks'til their next meal,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheek </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> charge d'affaires in <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION>. `` I think we're going to see people moving pretty soon. ... The future looks pretty grim right now.'' An added complication is the thousands of local government officials and leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> Marxist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ethiopia </ORGANIZATION> who are fleeing rebel retaliation in the contested areas. They now are gathered in <LOCATION> Asmara </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION>'s capital, and in <LOCATION> Mekele </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Tigre </LOCATION>. The government's chief relief official in <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Berhanu </PERSON> <PERSON> Jembere </PERSON>, said in an interview that full relief operations would be resumed and foreign aid workers would be allowed to return to the north only after the area is `` cleansed of bandit activity.'' He could not say when that might be. Secessionist rebels in <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION> have been fighting for 27 years in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s longest civil war. In <LOCATION> Tigre </LOCATION>, guerrillas seeking greater autonomy and a say in the government took up arms in 1974. Relief officials fear the foreign aid workers were withdrawn from the northern provices to keep them from seeing what is happening in the war zone. They say the government's exemption of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> personnel from the expulsion order weakened its argument that the foreigners were removed from <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION> and Tigre for their own safety. At best, they say, the government hopes to avoid the embarrassment of foreigners becoming war casualties or the inconvenience of dealing with relief convoys while it tries to fight the rebels. The worst case offered is that the governemnt wants to conceal a scorched-earth policy in the embattled territories, or to hide a policy of genocide by starvation. Despite the limited access, Western diplomats and relief officials said they had been able to confirm a government air strike on an important food distribution center in the Tigrean town of <LOCATION> Wukro </LOCATION>, which in recent weeks had fallen into rebel hands. These sources, citing accounts of eyewitnesses, said the bombing April 8 killed at least 50 people and wounded many more, minutes after several thousand peasants were given emergency food rations. <PERSON> Berhanu </PERSON> said he could not confirm an air attack, but added that the government's policy against the rebels would be `` an eye for an eye, if not more.'' He also said the safety of the drought-sticken peasants depended on their own patriotism. `` They are expected to join hands with the military so that the enemies can be wiped out,'' he said. `` The people themselves, I think, should decide _ and that decision is just to cleanse themselves of bandits.'' The military priorities also are impinging on relief efforts in other provinces less severely affected by the drought but still in need of aid. Relief workers in <LOCATION> Hararghe </LOCATION> province, east of <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shoa </LOCATION>, north of the capital, say some peasants have been afraid to leave their homes _ either to plow their fields or receive food rations _ for fear of being picked up by local officials and taken to the war zone. Sources say an emergency conscription is reaching into all corners of this North African nation to bring tens of thousands of able-bodied young men into military ranks to fight in the north. The military difficulties inhibit a well-prepared relief operation, in contrast to the food disaster three years ago, when foreign assistance arrived too late to save many of those who died. With the drought this time, food distribution began early, before malnourishment reached desperate levels, and enough grain was pledged to fulfill the projected need, estimated at 1.23 million metric tons by the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. But even before the expulsion of foreigners from the north and rebel offensives in March, the war already was hindering the relief effort. Rebel attacks and land mines destroyed more than 100 trucks used in the relief effort and often forced the closing of roads over which food moved. Now, hundreds of governent-controlled trucks that had been hauling relief food have been diverted to the war effort. The transportation shortage exacerbates problems at <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s two Red Sea ports, <LOCATION> Massawa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Assab </LOCATION>, where food is piling up without sufficient storage facilities, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> `` We're particularly concerned it could be diverted to the military,'' said Ambassador <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. Cheek, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomat, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would not allow its relief assistance to be administered by indigenous organizations whose operations were not subject to on-the-scene monitoring by foreign aid officials. `` We now have a war disaster imposed on a drought disaster,'' he said. `` We have yet to solve that, to figure out how, in the context of the double disaster, to perform our humanitarian function.''

 In the mean terrain of northern <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, secessionist rebels and black <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s biggest and best-armed military force are fighting one of the world's longest and most obscure wars. Every so often, the conflict pops to the world's attention, only to fade like a smothered flare. It has gained attention once again because a spate of recent rebel victories, drought and a cut-off of routes for food aid have combined to raise the threat of famine for 3.2 million people in the area. <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION>'s civil war began in 1961 against the feudal rule of Emperor <PERSON> Haile </PERSON> <PERSON> Selassie </PERSON>. Today it is against the Marxist, Soviet-backed government that ousted Selassie in 1973. The original rebel group, the <ORGANIZATION> Eritrean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- ELF -RRB-, broke up into four groups over religious and ideological differences. The largest and most powerful of the splinter groups is the Marxist but anti-Soviet <ORGANIZATION> Eritrean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> EPLF </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, with 30,000 fighters. The ELF, which is predominantly Moslem and conservative, now numbers about 5,000 fighters and has not been effective since its clash with the <ORGANIZATION> EPLF </ORGANIZATION> in 1972-74. The East and the West, particularly the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, have a stake in the outcome of the conflict because of <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s place on the strategic Horn of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Conservative Arab states like <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>, fearful of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s current influence in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, openly support the <ORGANIZATION> EPLF </ORGANIZATION>, even though it is mainly Christian, because it opposes the Soviet presence in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> back the ELF. <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> generally has remained aloof from the conflict. While the Ethiopian government receives weapons from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and troops from <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, the West does not provide any similar support to the rebels. Most of their weapons and supplies are captured from the government. <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, one of the first countries to back the rebels at the start of their campaign against <PERSON> Selassie </PERSON>'s pro-Western government nearly three decades ago, now sides with the central government. <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> followed in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s path. The <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> both train the rebels. President <PERSON> Mengistu </PERSON> <PERSON> Haile </PERSON> <PERSON> Mariam </PERSON> has said his Ethiopian forces soon will launch a major offensive against the rebels. A dozen previous `` major offensives'' failed in the past. The rebels have <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION>'s rugged terrain as their chief ally and they have been able to stand off 120,000 Ethiopian soldiers, 20,000 Cubans and hundreds of Soviet advisers. The rebels main tactics are hit-and-run attacks and ambushes of government troops as they move through narrow, mountainous passes. For most of its 3,000-year history, <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION> has been coveted by foreign powers and neighbors. It is about the size of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and has mineral resources, including gold, iron and copper, none of which is exploited because of the war. Its 3.5 million people are mostly peasant farmers. <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION>'s allure is its geographical position. The province sits strategically at the crossroads of the Horn of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, commanding the gateway to the <LOCATION> Bab </LOCATION> el <ORGANIZATION> Mandab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strait </ORGANIZATION> from the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>, nowadays one of the main routes for Middle Eastern oil. It's 625-mile Red Sea coastline includes the ports of <LOCATION> Assab </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Massawa </LOCATION>. It has the only non-Arab access to the Red Sea. Without <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> would be landlocked.

 `` COLORS'' `` Colors'' marks the return of <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopper </PERSON> to directing, and that should have been news in itself. His 1969 `` Easy Rider'' changed the face of the Hollywood film industry forever, then <PERSON> Hopper </PERSON> fell from grace. After two decades of drugs and booze, he turned his life around and returned as an actor of remarkable depth. Reportedly the insistence of <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Penn </PERSON> resulted in <LOCATION> Hopper </LOCATION>'s chance to direct again A good thing. `` Colors'' reveals <PERSON> Hopper </PERSON> as a filmmaker of great skill, though a glimmer remains of the indulgences that contributed to his downfall. As a director of action, <PERSON> Hopper </PERSON> is superlative. Just when you think you had seen every kind of car chase, he provides one through the streets and back alleys of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> that is truly breathtaking. And a fugitive's rampage through a crowded restaurant, pursued by <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION>, is a kinetic wonder. On the downside, <PERSON> Hopper </PERSON> betrays his existential tendencies, staging confrontational scenes that have no real motivation or payoff. This partly may be due to <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Schiffer </PERSON>'s rather formless script. <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Duvall </PERSON> are unlikely partners on the gang war scene. <PERSON> Duvall </PERSON> is nearing retirement, a cool head who tries to establish a rapport with gang members. <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION> is hotheaded and himself prone to violence. Both try to act as <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacemakers in the growing war between the `` Bloods'' and the `` Cripps.'' `` Colors'' manages to portray the gang members as human beings not senseless criminals. <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION>, who may be the <PERSON> Brando </PERSON> of his generation, continues his string of impressive performances, and <PERSON> Duvall </PERSON> performs with his usual authority. <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Conchita </PERSON> <PERSON> Alonso </PERSON> is wasted as the obligatory love interest. The Orion release was produced by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Solo </PERSON> and scored with fine, thumping style by <PERSON> Herbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hancock </PERSON>. The R rating is well deserved because of the street language, violence, nudity and sex scenes. Running time: 2 hours. _ By <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 `` WHITE MISCHIEF'' While <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> broiled with the ravages of World War II, British colonists frolicked at <LOCATION> Happy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>. The war for them was a distant thunder: Theirs was a life of sex, drugs and endless perversions _ mirroring the downside and downfall of the British Empire. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Radford </PERSON> captures that aristocratic decadence in <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION>'s `` White Mischief,'' a <ORGANIZATION> Nelson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> and Goldcrest release, starring <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Miles </PERSON>, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Dance </PERSON> and <PERSON> Greta </PERSON> <PERSON> Scacchi </PERSON>. The arrogant and carefree Earl of <PERSON> Erroll </PERSON> -LRB- Dance -RRB- leads the pack in a round of parties, costume balls, group sex, club romps, polo matches and horse races. He has had affairs with every white woman in the area and possibly some black African women as well. Into his seedy sphere steps the ever-so-straight Sir Jock Delves <PERSON> Broughton </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Joss </PERSON> <PERSON> Ackland </PERSON> -RRB-, a reserved 57-year-old, and his sensual 27-year-old bride, <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Scacchi </PERSON> -RRB-. With one smoldering glance, <PERSON> Erroll </PERSON> and <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> soon find their way to bed and a tumultuous affair that leads to his murder. <PERSON> Jock </PERSON> is put on trial for the homicide and acquitted. But in the aftermath, his colder, more vicious side is revealed, and the <LOCATION> Happy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> community realizes its last gasp. One would think that decadence and death would be good fodder for a fast-paced flick. But `` White Mischief'' is like a puritanical stripteaser: It promises more than it delivers. Still, there are some outstanding performances and delicious dialogue, especially from <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Miles </PERSON> as the kinky <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Janze </PERSON>. <PERSON> Alice </PERSON>, who bed hops with the best of them, is said to have murdered her first husband. During the trial reference is made to this, without naming her. Later, reporters ask <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> if she's the woman in question. Her response: `` Which one?'' The woman who killed her husband, the reporter says. `` Which one?'' she deadpans. Her straight-faced equal is <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurt </PERSON>, who has a much too small role as the rancher who also sets his sights on <PERSON> Diana </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ackland </PERSON>'s cuckolded <PERSON> Broughton </PERSON> is perfect in his restraint. Dance, however, seems almost miscast: He is not a looker nor particularly sensual. But he makes his character full of indifference with unbridled decadence, and that is the mood we are to feel throughout. There is excellent photography by <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Deakins </PERSON> of the splendid Kenyan landscape, and spritely costuming by <PERSON> Marit </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>. The <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> White-Umbrella </PERSON> Films Production runs 100 minutes and is rated R for language, drug use and adult themes. _ By <PERSON> Dolores </PERSON> <PERSON> Barclay </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Editor </ORGANIZATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> Staley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, seeking to thwart a $ 1.42 billion takeover bid by British sugar refiner <ORGANIZATION> Tate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Lyle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, said Monday it was negotiating with at least one other party interested in acquiring part or all of the company. <PERSON> Staley </PERSON>, the nation's second-largest refiner of corn syrup and a leading producer of food-service supplies, said last week it had discussed selling all or part of the company to third parties and expected to enter into such negotiations. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Satterfield </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> Staley </PERSON>, would not identify the parties. `` The significance here is that we've commenced negotiations,'' he said. `` There is a significant difference between discussions and negotiations.'' The company also said it would continue to explore other options to enhance shareholder value, including a financial restructuring or recapitalization, a joint venture or a leveraged buyout. In a leveraged buyout, the acquirer finances the purchase of the target company with sales of assets of the target or from its cash flow. Also Monday, <PERSON> Staley </PERSON> officials said the <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chancery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> had upheld the validity of the company's shareholder-rights plan and other measures taken to defend against the <ORGANIZATION> Tate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON> takeover bid. Company officials also said a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> upheld the constitutionality of the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> anti-takeover statute as it applied to <PERSON> Staley </PERSON>. Industry analysts have mentioned Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> Kraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> as a company that may have an interest in acquiring <PERSON> Staley </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> CFS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> food-service division. <PERSON> Staley </PERSON> defeated <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> in a bidding war for CFS Continental in October 1984. But several analysts refused to speculate Monday on which companies might be talking with <PERSON> Staley </PERSON>. `` Everything that can be said has been said,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Elam </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Blunt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ellis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loewi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` I'm just waiting for something to occur that's concrete and palpable, and I do n't know what it's going to be. <PERSON> Staley </PERSON>'s board of directors last week advised the company's shareholders to reject <ORGANIZATION> Tate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON>'s second cash tender offer, which totals about $ 1.42 billion, or $ 35 a share Analysts have said <PERSON> Staley </PERSON> has a market value of about $ 40 a share. In composite trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Staley </PERSON> closed up 50 cents to $ 38.75 Monday. London-based <ORGANIZATION> Tate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s second-largest sugar refiner, owns about 5 percent of <PERSON> Staley </PERSON>'s stock and wants to acquire the entire company for its A.E. <ORGANIZATION> Staley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary, which produces corn sweeteners. <PERSON> Staley </PERSON> was based in <LOCATION> Decatur </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, until about three years ago, when it moved its headquarters to <ORGANIZATION> Rolling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Meadows </ORGANIZATION> in suburban <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Tate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON> has promised to move <PERSON> Staley </PERSON>'s headquarters back to <LOCATION> Decatur </LOCATION>, in central Illinois, if its takeover attempt succeeds.

 Export subsidies, liberal credit and food aid have become increasingly important parts of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agricultural trade, efforts the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says are needed to help the American farmer meet foreign competition. The Export Enhancement Program is the hottest program at present, and is being used in a virtual head-to-head confrontation with the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> over trade policy. `` <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exporters operate in a competitive trade environment influenced by other exporters' subsidies and importers' barriers,'' says analyst <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. For example, the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> operates a system of export subsidies which enables high-priced wheat from the 12-nation trading bloc to be sold on world markets at competitive prices, he said. Since 1978, the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> has joined the traditional big four _ <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ as a wheat exporter. It was the use of export subsidies, to reduce high internal prices, that enabled the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> to change from a net importer of wheat to a net exporter. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had used some kinds of export subsidies in the past, but it was the advent of the Export Enhancement Program, or EEP, in 1985 that caught the attention of world traders. Under the program, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exporters are given bonuses, or subsidies, of government-owned commodities to compensate for reduced prices paid by a foreign buyer. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> does this only for the sale of certain commodities to designated countries. As of April 28, exporters had sold more than $ 4.81 billion worth of commodities to foreign buyers. That is the amount paid by the overseas customers. The exporters then collected bonuses of surplus commodities owned by the department's <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Those bonuses, or subsidies, had a CCC book value of $ 2.86 billion _ the amount the <ORGANIZATION> CCC </ORGANIZATION> had paid for them under its domestic price support operations But the actual market value of the bonus commodities was less than $ 2.05 billion, reflecting their estimated worth on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> domestic market at the time. Thus, according to the figures supplied by the department's <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, the commodities sold by exporters for $ 4.81 billion would have cost the foreign buyers at least $ 6.86 billion if it had not been for the $ 2.05 billion in the market value of the bonuses In other words, the bonuses reduced the purchase prices of the <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> commodities by about 30 percent. Since the program began three years ago, more than 40 million metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat have been sold at subsidized prices, the agency said. Although wheat is by far the largest <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> commodity, other items include barley, sorghum, rice, poultry feed, vegetable oil, frozen poultry, live dairy cattle, and eggs. In his report, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said the chief markets for wheat under <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> have been the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> has been the main barley purchaser. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s analysis in the May issue of Agricultural Outlook magazine refers to other export programs as well as EEP. Those include programs for short-term export credit financing; Targeted Export Assistance, or TEA, in which producer groups are helped to carry out overseas promotional activities; and Food for Peace, or P.L. 480 assistance for needy countries. Although the impact of TEA is difficult to measure, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said the other programs account for `` a significant share'' of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commodity exports. In the case of wheat, for example, 60 percent to 70 percent of the exports in the 1986-87 fiscal year that ended Sept. 30 were covered by <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> programs. `` Four of the top five markets for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat in 1987 were chief markets for wheat under the <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION>, CCC credit guarantees, or food aid,'' he said. `` <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the top market in value terms for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat, was the exception, purchasing its wheat outside <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> export programs.'' But the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the second-largest buyer, used the <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> program extensively. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, which were third and fifth last year, bought <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat under a combination of <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> and the export credit program. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, which was the fourth-largest market, also bought significant amounts through credit arrangements. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said that more than half of the 1987 exports of vegetable oils involved <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> programs, primarily credit and food aid. <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> also benefited, including credit sales to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, and food aid shipments to the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Leone </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> holds about 60 percent of the world feed grain trade, up from a low of 45 percent two years ago, he said. Most export sales are without the use of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> export programs. Cotton is another major commodity that is not involved in the programs in a major way.

<TEXT>
 Japanese automakers will claim a larger share of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> automobile market without having to boost exports because they will build more cars in this country, according to a new study. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s market share will grow as that of <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> shrinks, according to <PERSON> Booz </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Allen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Hamilton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a New York-based management firm. The analysis was released last week in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> during a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automotive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION>' Government and Industry panel and reported in Sunday editions of The Detroit News. The analysis predicted that by 1990: _ New plants will add about 30,000 jobs, but not all will be unionized _ <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION> automakers' share of the domestic market will fall to 56 percent, compared with 68 percent in 1987. _ Japanese automakers' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market share will pass 30 percent as production at North American factories increases while import levels stay at 2.2 million a year In the late 1970s, as imported Japanese cars zoomed in popularity, cries of trade protectionism were heard. In turn, the Japanese instituted voluntary restraints on the number of cars exported to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> every year. But since <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> opened an auto assembly plant in December 1982 in <LOCATION> Marysville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, Japanese companies have been building increasing numbers of cars in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, sometimes in joint ventures with one of the Big Three automakers. `` It's going to be more and more difficult to define what is a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> company'' in the near future, said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Mateyka </PERSON>, a vice president with the management firm's office in <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION>, Md. `` After <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> adds its engine and transmission plants -LRB- in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> -RRB-, will it be less American than <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>?'' he asked. By 1990, Japanese production in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will reach about 2.2 million cars a year, about the same as import restrictions allow, said the analysis.

<HEAD>Central Bank Intervenes As Pound Rises On Lawson Resignation
Rumors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Bank of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> intervened in the foreign exchange market to stem a surge in the pound, as rumors flew Monday that Chancellor of the Exchequer <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> was planning to resign, dealers said. The intervention was light to moderate, dealers said. A Bank of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> official declined to comment on the reports of intervention. A <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> official denied the rumors about <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>. Neither official was identified, in accordance with British custom. The pound rose to $ 1.8785 by midday local time from $ 1.8730 in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> on Friday. It was quoted well above 3.1300 West German marks at 3.1587 marks. Dealers said sterling began to climb in overnight trading, in the wake of a bullish report by the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which was highlighted in The Sunday Times. In the report, <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION> chief international economist <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> said the pound was significantly undervalued against the Deutsche mark and could climb over the next few months. The report contended that British industry would still be competitive if the pound rose as high as 3.27 marks. Dealers said the report served as an excuse to buy pounds. Rumors that <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> would resign sent sterling surging in the early afternoon before the intervention took place, dealers said. <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> favors intervention to stem the pound's rise. When <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> stated on March 10 that any further rise in the pound's rise could not be sustained, the pound stood at 3.08 marks. <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> clashed at that time with Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, who said the pound should be allowed to rise in foreign exchange markets to contain inflation. <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>'s report argued that fears that the pound's rise could lead to the devastation of British industry were totally unfounded and he said <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>'s quest for stability was ill-founded. <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> said the British economy's growth rate this year will be double <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s and that while <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has a budget surplus, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is facing an `` exploding budget deficit'' _ higher even than <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s as a percentage of national income.'' At the same time the American economy is on course for higher inflation than <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> by the end of this year, and is saddled with huge trade and budget deficits for the forseeable future, <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> said. He said the pound could surge over the next few months, perhaps to 3.20 marks and $ 2. `` People do n't appreciate how dynamic the British economy has become,'' <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> said. He said that because of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s lack of political worries and its budget surplus, foreign investors see <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> as a more attractive country in which to invest than the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The Sunday Times said the <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION> report `` contradicts a widely held view in the <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> -LRB- of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> financial district -RRB- that sterling will slide in response to a rising balance of payments deficit.'' <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> said the balance of payments deficit in prospect for this year, which he expects to be between 5 billion and 6 billion pounds _ or $ 9.35 and $ 11.22 billion _ can be readily financed without any increase in interest rates. He said <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has no fundamental balance of payments problem.

 <ORGANIZATION> Laventhol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Horwath </ORGANIZATION> has paid $ 15 million in an out-of-court settlement of a lawsuit charging the accounting firm with racketeering. The firm made the settlement last Friday with attorneys for 2,850 investors who lost a total of more than $ 20 million in a failed tax-shelter program audited by <PERSON> Laventhol </PERSON>. The settlement must be approved by a judge in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Laventhol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> Counsel <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Augenbraun </PERSON> told The Associated Press Monday. <PERSON> Laventhol </PERSON>, based in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, is the nation's ninth-largest accounting firm. A jury found in favor of the investors in February, making <ORGANIZATION> Laventhol </ORGANIZATION> the first big accounting firm to lose a jury trial under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. Under the federal law, known as RICO, plaintiffs are automatically eligible for triple damages. Under the racketeering charge, <PERSON> Laventhol </PERSON> was accused of complicity in the tax-shelter scheme. The shelters were offered by Dairy World Genetics Partnerships, a series of limited partnerships, in 1970, 1980 and 1981. The settlement of the class-action suit is entirely covered by <PERSON> Laventhol </PERSON>'s liability insurance, <PERSON> Augenbraun </PERSON> said. Some attorneys believe the magnitude of the <ORGANIZATION> Laventhol </ORGANIZATION> settlement could have negative implications for the accounting profession. `` As long as the plaintiffs allege that accountants are in cahoots with the company in defrauding investors, any accounting firm can get caught up in RICO,'' <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Earle </PERSON>, former general counsel of accounting firm <ORGANIZATION> Peat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marwick </ORGANIZATION>, told the Wall Street Journal.

<TEXT>
 Global economic upheavals such as the October stock market collapse show that the world urgently needs a new monetary system, according to a study released today. The study, sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION>, concludes that the international agreements by which the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has tried to manage the dollar over the past three years have proven `` agonizingly fragile.'' The agreements did not go far enough because of political obstacles in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the study says. `` The possibility of backsliding, over-committing or reneging has continually threatened the credibility of these deals,'' said <PERSON> Yoichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Funabashi </PERSON>, the study's author. The study is titled `` Managing the Dollar: From the Plaza to the Louvre.'' It traces the effort beginning in September 1985 to weaken the dollar as a way of lowering the huge <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficits. The administration reached an agreement with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> at the Plaza Hotel in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in which the five nations pledged to force the dollar lower through a process known as intervention, by which governments buy and sell currencies in the open market to influence their value. The administration, which for years had boasted about the dollar's upward surge, abruptly reversed course after <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> took over as treasury secretary from <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> believed a weaker dollar was needed to fight growing protectionist sentiment in a <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> alarmed by the soaring trade deficit. A weaker dollar makes American products more competitive on overseas markets while making imports more expensive in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its allies switched course again in February 1987 with the <LOCATION> Louvre </LOCATION> agreement which said that the dollar had declined far enough. The nations pledged to intervene in currency markets to defend the dollar against continued downward pressure. Despite that pledge, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency has come under repeated selling pressure because of the stubbornly high <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit, which last year hit a record $ 171.2 billion. The downward pressure on the dollar and efforts by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> to prop up its value by raising <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates last fall were two of the factors cited in the Oct. 19 stock market crash. Financial markets remain convinced that the dollar will have to fall farther to correct the trade deficits. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has become the world's largest debtor nation as Americans have transferred billions of dollars into the hands of foreigners to pay for Japanese cars, Korean television sets and French wines. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s new status as a net debtor makes it imperative for the new administration to intensify efforts at international cooperation, the study said. The study recommended building on the approach established by the <LOCATION> Louvre </LOCATION> agreement, by which each nation's currency is placed in a so-called target zone and any time the currency moves outside the agreed-upon zone, nations launch actions including intervention to bring it back into line. The study said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> bargaining position would be strengthened if the administration made a greater effort to include <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in the economic decision-making process since such needed changes as reducing the federal budget deficit can only be accomplished through congressional action. The study, based on interviews with many of the officials involved, reveals some key details of the secret negotiations over the past three years. The administration's changed position from a hands-off approach to the dollar to actively trying to push it lower was engineered by then-Deputy Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>, a key <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> aide who has been behind many of the administration's most successful economic initiatives. <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> detailed the proposed change in a secret memo to <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> in the spring of 1985, soon after <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, the White House chief of staff in <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s first term, swapped jobs with <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Funabashi </PERSON> says the original goal of the Plaza accord was to drive down the dollar's value by between 10 percent and 12 percent through an intensive six-week intervention effort with a price tag of $ 18 billion. This goal was realized. The Louvre accord, signed in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> in February 1987, sought to stabilize exchange rates, keeping the dollar from falling by more than 5 percent from a base of 153.5 yen to the dollar. The dollar has continued to fall, however, and now stands around 125 yen, down almost 50 percent from its peak of 263.7 yen in February 1985. <PERSON> Funabashi </PERSON>, who has covered economics for 20 years, is the deputy editor of economic affairs for the Japanese newspaper the <ORGANIZATION> Asahi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION>. He wrote the dollar study during a year in which he was a visiting fellow at the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION>, a seven-year-old <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> think tank funded by grants from various foundations including the German Marshall Fund and the <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>.

 The stock market held steady today in another quiet session. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 3.15 to 2,004.31 in the first half hour of trading. Gainers outnumbered losers by less than 5 to 4 in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 505 up, 415 down and 449 unchanged.

More than half of that activity, however, was concentrated in a single issue _ <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>, which was unchanged at 30 -RCB- on turnover of 22.6 million shares. Analysts cited trading strategies keyed to the electric utility holding company's impending quarterly dividend. Otherwise, brokers said the mood of the marketplace remained wary and subdued.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> is drafting a new charter for <ORGANIZATION> Arabian-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, cutting its legal ties to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> but seeking joint ventures with the four <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> oil companies that formerly owned the oil giant, an oil newsletter reported. The Middle East Economic Survey said Monday that <ORGANIZATION> Aramco </ORGANIZATION> will probably be called Saudi National Oil Co.-Aramco. Aramco is the largest oil-producing company in the non-communist world. It is currently incorporated in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>. The restructured company will be `` the vehicle for the kingdom's drive to establish a substantial presence in the downstream -LRB- refining and marketing -RRB- industry overseas by means of joint ventures with the former <ORGANIZATION> Aramco </ORGANIZATION> parents as well as with others,'' editor <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> wrote in the authoritative newsletter He said the new <ORGANIZATION> Aramco </ORGANIZATION> will retain its technical and managerial assistance contracts with the four former <ORGANIZATION> Aramco </ORGANIZATION> parents _ <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> _ but not necessarily with the same contracts or the same terms. There could also be scope for similar assistance agreements with other companies, <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> said. He mentioned press reports of a deal under which <ORGANIZATION> Saudi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arabia </ORGANIZATION> would acquire 50 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s major refining amd marketing assets. The effort to establish joint ventures in refining and marketing in oil-consuming countries is designed to counter oil price instability by `` providing secure outlets for Saudi crude, secure supplies for the non-Saudi partners and good profits for both parties,'' <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> wrote. `` The presence of a foreign partner to provide local know-how in the market concerned is regarded as an absolute prerequisite for the <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> newcomer,'' he said. `` The objective is to have an integrated national oil company controlled, managed and operated by Saudis.'' For years <ORGANIZATION> Aramco </ORGANIZATION>, founded in 1933, controlled the production and sale of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> crude oil, paying royalties to the <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> government. In 1973 <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> bought a 25 percent share in <ORGANIZATION> Aramco </ORGANIZATION> and a year later raised its stake to 60 percent. In 1980 it acquired full control. As recently as 1986, <ORGANIZATION> Aramco </ORGANIZATION> still had nearly 4,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> employees, including many top executives. This year Saudi Oil Minister <PERSON> Hisham </PERSON> <PERSON> Nazer </PERSON> was appointed chairman and another <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Naimi </PERSON>, president since 1984, was named chief executive. <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> said the charter for the restructured <PERSON> Aramco </PERSON> was being discussed by a ministerial committee set up by Saudi King Fahd. Aramco now produces around 4 million barrels of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> oil a day. It refines 450,000 barrels a day at <PERSON> Ras </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanura </PERSON> on <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>'s Gulf coast A barrel is the equivalent of 42 gallons. The company markets crude through its offices at <LOCATION> Dhahran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, and through an international affiliate with offices in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Grain, Soybean Futures Open Mixed To Lower</HEAD>

 Grain and soybean futures opened mixed to lower today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> but prices steadied when it appeared soybean prices could not be pushed more than about 5 cents lower per bushel. The opening drop in the soybean and corn pits was linked to weekend rains over much of the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, analysts said. But the rains were not heavy and the latest forecasts _ calling for dry conditions to prevail until this weekend _ lent support to the markets, said <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Karlin </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` Once values were able to hold at certain levels, that was enough to encourage a little buying,'' he said. Wheat futures were slightly higher in response to dry-weather forecasts for the northern Plains states. Position-evening ahead of Tuesday's winter wheat production report from the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> also helped boost prices, <PERSON> Karlin </PERSON> said. In early trading, wheat was \ cent lower to 2 \ cents higher with the contract for delivery in May at $ 3 a bushel; corn was -RCB- cent to 1 cent lower with May at $ 2.01 a bushel; oats were unchanged to -RCB- cent lower with May at $ 1.60 \ a bushel; soybeans were 3 \ cents to 4 -LCB- cents lower with May at $ 6.89 Livestock and meat futures were mostly higher in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle were .10 cent to .28 cent higher with June at 72.92 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .23 cent higher with May at 80 cents a pound; hogs were unchanged to .50 cent higher with June at 51.65 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .18 cent lower to .18 cent higher with May at 51.82 cents a pound. Cattle futures settled higher on Friday while pork futures retreated.

<HEAD>Pound Surges on Rumors of Lawson's Resignation, Other Factors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The British pound surged Monday in European trading, partly on rumors that Chancellor of the Exchequer <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> was resigning. The rumors were denied later. The sharp rise in the British currency prompted the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> to intervene by selling pounds in the foreign-exchange market, dealers said. The dollar turned mixed and gold prices rose. The pound was supported early in the day by a forecast from investment bank <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, highlighted in the Sunday Times, suggesting that the pound could rise to $ 2 and 3.20 marks. It was further boosted by rumors of huge sterling buy order, dealers said. Estimates of the size of the order ranged from $ 500 million to $ 1.5 billion, and dealers said the buyer was a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investment bank, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investment management firm, or a major <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> bank. The British currency was given a push by rumors, later firmly denied by the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>, that <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> was resigning. <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> is seen as the major government official most opposed to allowing the pound to rise. Dealers said the <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> rumor is frequent usually disregarded, but that in this instance it gave the currency an extra boost. The pound was quoted late in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at $ 1.8790, up from $ 1.8730 late Friday, and at 3.1606 marks, up from 3.1300 marks. The Bank of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> intervened around midday to hold down the pound's rise, dealers said. The bank sold pounds when the currency broke above $ 1.88, dealers said. The French franc was strong following the resounding victory by <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> in the presidential election. The dollar fell to 5.7075 francs from 5.7230 francs. Other late dollar rates compared with late Friday included: 1.6820 marks, up from 1.6805; 1.4010 Swiss francs, down from 1.4015; 1.8805 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8860; 1,250.00 Italian lire, down from 1,254.00; 1.2396 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2375. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where the business day ends as <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s begins, the dollar slipped 0.01 yen to a closing 124.87 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted slightly lower at 124.82 yen. Gold sold in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a late bid price of $ 444.00 a troy ounce, up from late Friday's $ 442.10. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, the late bid price was $ 445.00, up from $ 443 late Friday. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold rose 79 cents to close at a bid $ 446.66. Silver was quoted in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a late bid price of $ 6.43 a troy ounce, up from Friday's $ 6.36.

<HEAD>Better Office Absorption Forecast For Next Four Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The worst is over for <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>'s ailing office market, and a long-term recovery is gaining momentum that should increase occupancy over the next four years, researchers said. Most economic indicators point to a bottoming of the market in the first half of last year, said <ORGANIZATION> Rice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> vice president <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaines </PERSON>, who oversees the organization's <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Real </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estate </ORGANIZATION> Forecasting System. `` Since then, we've had positive absorption, positive job growth and generally positive economic indices,'' <PERSON> Gaines </PERSON> said. `` We are forecasting a good year for office absorption, with just over 2 million square feet absorbed in 1988.'' By 1991 or 1992, the city should not only see marked improvements in employment, but office absorption should increase to between 3.7 million and 6 million square feet, <PERSON> Gaines </PERSON> said. If a national economic downturn occurs in late 1989 or early 1990, however, about 40 percent less space will be absorbed, <PERSON> Gaines </PERSON> said. Yet even during the recession that is predicted by Rice Center's computer models, office space absorption _ the difference between the amount of space at the beginning of a certain period and the amount at the end _ will remain positive, albeit less robust `` Assuming that no more buildings are constructed, the overall occupancy rate in 1992 is projected to be approximately 81 percent, which is halfway between the current rate of 70 percent and a ` marginally healthy' rate of 90 percent,'' <PERSON> Gaines </PERSON> said. `` For Class A office space, however, the occupancy rate is expected to be slightly above 88 percent by 1992.'' A Class A building is generally of a high-quality finish, is new or competitive with new structures, and has a excellent location. The largest office market in terms of square footage if <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>'s central business district. Rice Center forecasts an overall occupancy rate this year in the central district of 80.1 percent, with Class A buildings having more tenants and a better occupancy rate of 84 percent. By 1992, the overall occupancy rate is projected to be 88 percent, with the occupancy level of Class A space pegged at 90 percent. Rice Center's <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Real </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forecasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> was two years in the making.

<HEAD>News-Gazette To Switch To Soy Ink</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHAMPAIGN, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Champaign-Urbana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-Gazette </ORGANIZATION> announced Monday it will begin printing its newspaper June 1 with ink made from soybean oil. Editor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON> said a `` commitment to the farm economy'' was the main factor in the decision to become the first <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> newspaper to use soy ink full time. `` It's an acknowledgement that we can use a product that's produced in <LOCATION> Champaign </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and do something to boost prospects for the east-central <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> economy,'' <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON> said `` If we can do that and if enough papers do it, it's going to make a difference.'' The newspaper conducted a trial in March, printing its annual farm edition with soy ink, and decided the new product worked at least as well as conventional newspaper ink. The most recent estimates indicate soy ink will cost about one-third more than conventional low-rub ink, but as the demand for it increases, the price could decrease. `` It should come down as more people use it,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Stodola </PERSON>, pressroom manager at the Cedar Rapids -LRB- <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> -RRB- Gazette. `` And with the oil situation the way it is abroad, who knows? Someday, soy ink may end up being cheaper than petroleum ink.'' The Cedar Rapids newspaper began using soy ink last year, and <PERSON> Stodola </PERSON> said said the soy oil makes colors brighter and helps prevent the ink from rubbing off on readers' hands. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Tiberend </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soybean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bloomington </LOCATION> praised the <ORGANIZATION> News-Gazette </ORGANIZATION>'s decision. He said he would try to persuade other newspapers to do the same. `` You're going to be using the soybeans that would be grown by a farmer on about 200 acres if he had 50-bushel yields,'' <PERSON> Tiberend </PERSON> said `` And if every daily in the state ... -LRB- the size of the News-Gazette -RRB- changed, it would use up 15,438 acres of beans a year.'' <PERSON> Tiberend </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soybean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> will declare the week of June 26 as Soybean Ink Week in the state in its efforts to get every newspaper to try the new product.

 Share prices on the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> closed lower on Monday on nervousness about the stronger pound, which could hurt British exports and corporate profits. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index ended 6.2 points, or 0.3 percent, lower at 1,794.9 at the close. The index hit a low of 7.8 points off and a high of 4.1 points up during the session. Volume was a low 368 million shares, compared with Friday's 609.4 million shares Participants played it cautiously after sterling began its rise Monday on currency markets. The pound continued to gain against the West German mark on the widespread belief that the West German central bank wo n't raise short-term interest rates, throwing the focus back onto sterling, traders said. Activity continued to cluster around the takeover stocks, dealers said, although less than in previous sessions. `` The only feature of this market is takeover chatter, but we did n't see that much of it,'' said one dealer.

Compact disks, although popular for music, have had trouble catching on in data storage because they could not be rewritten and it took much longer to find pieces of data stored on them. <ORGANIZATION> Maxtor </ORGANIZATION> said its Tahiti I, which uses 5 \ - inch disks, could find a piece of data on a disk in an average of less than 30 thousandths of That makes it more than three times as fast as most other compact disk drives and competitive with all but the fastest magnetic hard-disk drives. The Tahiti I can also erase and rewrite a disk many times without causing deterioration. <ORGANIZATION> Maxtor </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, is a leader in the traditional kind of data-storage devices, which use magnetic heads instead of lasers to read and write information on disks. Compact disks have the advantage of much greater storage capacity. `` The whole industry is going to watch to see if in fact they are on time on that -LRB- September delivery date -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Katzive </PERSON> said. `` But people who have discounted <ORGANIZATION> Maxtor </ORGANIZATION> in the past have eventually regretted it.'' <ORGANIZATION> Maxtor </ORGANIZATION> said its <LOCATION> Tahiti </LOCATION> I would sell wholesale for about $ 2,500. A smaller and slower model, the <LOCATION> Fiji </LOCATION> I, uses 3 -LCB- - inch disks and will sell wholesale for under $ 1,000, <ORGANIZATION> Maxtor </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> Maxtor </ORGANIZATION> said the technology for the <LOCATION> Fiji </LOCATION> I was jointly developed with another company, which it did not name. Disks for that device will be supplied by <ORGANIZATION> Seiko-Epson </ORGANIZATION> and other companies. More than 50 computer companies planned product announcements during the four-day Comdex trade show that opened in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> Monday. The event will draw about 60,000 visitors to the massive <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> and the nearby <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> Apparel Mart, where more than 850 manufacturers will be pushing their wares _ hard and soft. Attention at the show was expected to focus on clones of <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s Personal System-2 computer. <ORGANIZATION> Tandy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Dell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> already have announced their PS-2 clones, and those and others were expected to be on display.

Analysts cited trading strategies keyed to the electric utility holding company's impending quarterly dividend. Otherwise, brokers said the mood of the marketplace remained wary and subdued. Widespread talk continued of the possibility of further increases in interest rates, given the recent strength of the economy and fears of reviving inflation. Interest rates were mostly higher in the government securities market Monday. Over the next three days, the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> will auction $ 26 billion in new bonds and notes, and uncertainty has been running high about what effect that new supply will have on the credit markets. <ORGANIZATION> Murray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> jumped 18 to 53 -RCB-.

 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s pound rose sharply Monday on unfounded rumors the government's key advocate of currency weakness was preparing to quit, reinforcing predictions of a $ 2 exchange rate for sterling in the near future. Elsewhere in foreign-exchange dealings, the dollar was relatively stable, while gold prices rose. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> quoted bullion at $ 447.30 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, up from $ 443.25 late Friday. Money traders said action focused on the pound largely because of rumors, later denied by the British government, that Chancellor of the Exchequer <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> was about to resign. As the top British treasury official, <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> is seen as an important opponent of an expensive pound. In his view, the rising currency could hurt <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s economy by making exports less competitive, similar to what happened in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> earlier this decade when the dollar's value rose. Unconfirmed rumors also circulated Monday of a large commercial order for pounds, which forced dealers who had sold borrowed pounds to buy them back, a price-boosting market influence known as short-covering. Traders also were influenced by a forecast from the investment bank <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, quoted in the <ORGANIZATION> Sunday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, suggesting that the pound could rise to $ 2 and 3.20 West German marks. The pound is now worth about 3.16 marks. With the dollar's recent stability, the market has become preoccupied with the pound because of the relatively high interest rates offered in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, which make that currency more attractive to foreign investors. `` If I tell you exchange rates will be relatively stable, then what do you want to do with your wealth? Throw it to the country with the highest interest rates,'' said <PERSON> Varick </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, vice president of foreign exchange at the <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Switzerland </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> branch In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the pound rose to $ 1.8790, up from $ 1.8730 late Friday. Later in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the pound was worth $ 1.8815, vs. $ 1.8630 late Friday. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Liming </PERSON>, a currency analyst at the commodities futures firm <ORGANIZATION> LNS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, said many traders believed the pound would hit $ 1.92 in the near future. <PERSON> Zlatko </PERSON> <PERSON> Glamuzina </PERSON>, a trader at the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> branch of <ORGANIZATION> Banco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> di </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sicilia </ORGANIZATION>, said he believed the pound would rise significantly after it passes $ 1.90. `` Once we go over that we'll go to $ 2 a pound,'' he said. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar slipped 0.01 yen to close at 124.87 yen. Later in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it fetched 124.82 yen. By the time trading concluded in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the dollar fetched 124.80 yen, lower than the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> price but slightly higher than the Friday closing price in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> of 124.77 yen. Other late-dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> compared with levels late Friday included: 1.6815 marks, up from 1.6793; 1.4000 Swiss francs, up from 1.3995; 1.2385 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2373; 5.7060 French francs, down from 5.7090; and 1,249.50 Italian lire, down from 1,252.375. Late dollar rates in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> compared with late Friday: 1.6820 marks, up from 1.6805; 1.4010 Swiss francs, down from 1.4015; 1.8805 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8860; 1,250.00 Italian lire, down from 1,254.00; 1.2396 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2375; 5.7075 French francs, down from 5.7230. Gold sold in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a late bid price of $ 444.00 a troy ounce, up from $ 442.10 late Friday. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, the late bid price was $ 445.00 an ounce, vs. $ 443 late Friday, and in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> it was $ 446.66 an ounce vs. $ 445.87. On the Commodity Exchange in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, gold bullion for current delivery was quoted at $ 447.30, up $ 3.60 from Friday. Silver was quoted in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a late bid price of $ 6.43 a troy ounce, up from $ 6.36 Friday. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Comex </ORGANIZATION> price was $ 6.47 an ounce, up 8.9 cents.

<HEAD>Fears About South Africa Boost Precious Metals Futures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Precious metals futures prices rallied Monday on fears that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> would react to further <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic sanctions by reducing its exports of platinum and gold, analysts said. On other markets, copper futures also posted sharp gains; soybeans surged to four-year highs while the grains were mixed; cotton futures rallied strongly; livestock and meat were mixed; energy futures were mixed; and stock-index futures retreated. Platinum futures led the precious-metals rally, which analysts linked to rumors that passage of a bill in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to tighten the economic screws on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> would be met with a retaliatory decrease in exports of strategic metals to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Norris </PERSON>, chief metals trader for <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said the rumored retaliation would be `` a tit-for-tat type thing, where if we would tighten sanctions, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> would cut off platinum supplies. And any time you have some concerns about <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, it benefits gold, too.'' Platinum settled $ 12.90 to $ 13.10 higher on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with the contract for delivery in July at $ 539.50 a troy ounce. On the Commodity Exchange in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, gold settled $ 3.50 to $ 4.10 higher with June at $ 448.80 a troy ounce; silver was 8.9 cents to 9.2 cents higher with May at $ 6.47 a troy ounce. Copper futures rallied to their highest levels in about four weeks on the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in reaction to a report showing a drop in warehouse supplies at the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, analysts said. Copper settled 60 cents to $ 2.80 higher with May at $ 1.0065 a pound. Soybean futures surged near the close on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, boosting the near-month contract to $ 7 a bushel for the first time since mid-1984. Wheat also finished higher while corn futures retreated. Despite weekend rains that dampened the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, dry-weather fears provided much of the impetus for the soybean rally, said <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Karlin </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Wheat futures advanced moderately ahead of Tuesday's winter-wheat production report from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Karlin </PERSON> said Corn retreated slightly amid a lack of export demand. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> reported after Monday's close that soybean planting in the 19 major soybean states was 14 percent complete as of Sunday. Corn planting in the 17 major corn states was 70 percent finished, the report said. Wheat settled 2 -RCB- cents to 4 cents higher with May at $ 3.01 -RCB- a bushel; corn was \ cent to 1 cent lower with May at $ 2.00 \ a bushel; oats were 1 -RCB- cents lower to 1 -RCB- cents higher with May at $ 1.59 \ a bushel; soybeans were 7 \ cents to 9 -LCB- cents higher with May at $ 7 Dry-weather fears also sparked a rally in cotton futures on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cotton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Cotton settled 1.42 cents to 1.74 cents higher with July at 63.15 cents a pound. Cattle futures finished mixed on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> as traders sold the deferred-month contracts and bought contracts for near-term delivery, analysts said. Hog futures settled higher on technical factors while pork bellies were lower on fears of a continuing glut of bellies in cold storage. Live cattle settled .20 cent lower to .10 cent higher with June at 72.80 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent lower to .35 cent higher with May at 80.05 cents a pound; hogs were .02 cent to .70 cent higher with June at 51.67 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .25 cent to 1 cent lower with May at 51.55 cents a pound. Energy futures were mixed in featureless trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 3 cents to 20 cents lower with June at $ 17.54 a barrel; heating oil was .50 cent lower to .25 cent higher with June at 47.67 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .07 cent to .25 cent higher with June at 51.59 cents a gallon. Stock-index futures retreated modestly on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where the contract for June delivery of the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 index settled 1.05 points lower at 257.10.

 <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which earned industry-record profits in 1987 and in the first quarter of 1988, is hiring new workers for the first time since the layoffs of the early 1980s, a trade journal reported Monday. In addition, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> is using hiring techniques learned from foreign automakers who have <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factories _ methods that include intense testing, screening and interviewing, Automotive News reported. The so-called transplants _ <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> factories in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ take as many as 100,000 applications to fill 2,000 openings. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, which laid off about 69,000 workers at the beginning of the decade, has only about 2,000 remaining on indefinite layoff. The others were recalled or dropped off the recall rolls after several years. `` In recent months we have in certain locations been able to hire new people because even these 2,000 people with recall rights are limited by certain restrictions to plants in their area,'' <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Foote </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's on a small scale, just a smattering here and there,'' he said. `` It's been going on for a few months.'' The latest hiring process takes about a month, a big change from practices of the past, when a worker hired Friday was put on the assembly line Monday. New workers are put up in a hotel and given a week of orientation by the company and the union. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Novotny </PERSON>, time standards representative at <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Local </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 879 </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s Twin Cities truck plant in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, said it represents `` a totally new way of hiring.'' At the Twin Cities plant, about 50 workers will be chosen from among 2,000 applicants, <PERSON> Novotny </PERSON> said. About 150 workers already have been hired at the plant, most of whom have never worked in an auto plant, said Local 879 Chairman <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Knight </PERSON>. The new workers include former teachers and members of the military. Some of the applicants not selected were children of current workers who failed drug tests, <PERSON> Novotny </PERSON> said. Drug use is one of the biggest problems in auto plants, although few union officials want to discuss it publicly. `` That has caused some heartbreak,'' <PERSON> Novotny </PERSON> said, `` but it will make a better work place in the long run.'' In addition to Twin Cities, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> also has been hiring at its <LOCATION> Wixom </LOCATION> assembly plant, which builds the <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Town </ORGANIZATION> Car and <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>, at its Climate Control Division plant in <LOCATION> Plymouth </LOCATION>, and at its Plastic Products Division plant in <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION>. Those three plants are outside <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. The hiring has been prompted by new <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> contract rules that allow workers who took jobs at other plants to return to their home plants as openings occur. When they leave, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> often has to hire new workers to replace them. By comparison, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest automaker, is doing no new hiring because it still has 60,000 workers on indefinite layoff and is shrinking some of its operations. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has at least 8,000 workers on indefinite layoff.

 <ORGANIZATION> Lucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it has provided confidential information to rival <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in exchange for an agreement that it will sweeten or end its hostile takeover bid by May 17. Lucky said it continues to recommend that its shareholders accept the leveraged buyout offer of $ 61 a share, or $ 2.35 billion, made on April 28 by the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Gibbons </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION>, van <ORGANIZATION> Amerongen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd </ORGANIZATION>. But analysts said <ORGANIZATION> Salt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> remains a strong contender under the new agreement, which Lucky said also provides a number of protections to its stockholders. `` My continuing belief is that <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> will acquire Lucky,'' said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Comeau </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Wood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gundy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` From the beginning, it was apparent that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> badly wanted Lucky, needed Lucky and can afford to pay more for it than anyone else.'' Lucky closed down 37.5 cents a share at $ 61.37 -LCB- on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> stock fell 50 cents a share to $ 59.75. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION>, which initiated the bidding with a $ 45-a-share offer that Lucky rejected in March, is the owner of the <ORGANIZATION> Alpha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beta </ORGANIZATION> grocery chain. With an acquisition of Lucky, the nation's sixth-largest supermarket chain, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> would surpass No 1 <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> to become the industry leader. The Lucky transaction would be by far the biggest ever for the Gibbons-led buyout group, which specializes in leveraged buyouts. If Lucky breaks the merger agreement, the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investment firm must be paid a $ 20 million fee plus expenses. <PERSON> Comeau </PERSON> said a supermarket chain can afford to pay more than anyone making a leveraged buyout. `` When you put supermarket chains together, one plus one equals three'' because of `` synergistic and strategic benefits,'' he said. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Rotter </PERSON>, an analyst with <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Olmstead </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, said he would not be surprised if <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> makes a new offer even though the pending bid is fairly valued. `` If this operation is worth $ 61 to an independent party, it should be worth more to <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION>, which could reap many benefits by integrating Lucky's operations into their operations,'' <PERSON> Rotter </PERSON> said.

 <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it had produced the first fully functioning computer chips to have features measuring just a half micron across. The microscopically compact chips were made for the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> by <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> facility in <LOCATION> Manassas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, the company said. They will be used for such things as capturing and processing radar and sonar signals. `` This is a significant technological milestone for <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Gianopulos </PERSON>, laboratory director of <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Manassas </LOCATION>, said in a news release. `` <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> is leading the pack,'' <PERSON> Sonny </PERSON> <PERSON> Maynard </PERSON>, the director of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Very </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Speed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Integrated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> program, said in the release. <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> TRW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the other two companies that have defense contracts to develop half-micron chips, have not completed theirs yet. <ORGANIZATION> TRW </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dolan </PERSON> said the company was on schedule toward a September 1989 deadline on its self-healing `` super chip,'' which will have about 4 million transistors, compared to about 100,000 for <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s chip. <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Eich </PERSON> said her company was also on schedule. Compact chips run faster because the electricity has less distance to travel. A micron is one-millionth of a meter, or about one-hundredth the thickness of a sheet of typing paper. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s contract with the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> restricts how <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> can use the half-micron technology for its commercial products, spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Root </PERSON> said. Chip companies such as <ORGANIZATION> Intel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Micro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Devices </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> are planning new fabrication lines for half-micron chips, according to <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>, a market research analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Integrated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Scottsdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION> `` This is what all the semiconductor makers are shooting for,'' <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Top Black Companies Are Restructuring to Compete, Survey Says</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: RETRANSMITTING to fix garble in 10th graf.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The nation's largest black-owned companies are restructuring to face competition and an uncertain economy, according to a new survey released Monday by <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> magazine. The magazine's latest annual survey of the top 100 black industrial and service companies shows that, like many <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies in general, leading black businesses are exploring new approaches in order to be competitive. Many black companies have grown recently through mergers and acquisitions, joint ventures, new technology and marketing approaches, and branching out into new industries, said the survey in the magazine's June issue. Taken together, the top 100 companies ranked in the survey had gross revenues of $ 4.1 billion in 1987. All but one of them are privately owned. The competition was fierce enough last year to force into bankruptcy three companies formerly on the list: <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chem-Con </ORGANIZATION>, an electronics manufacturer and defense contractor; hair-care products maker American Beauty Products; and oil products distributor <PERSON> J.R </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Son </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The survey points to black-owned computer and information services companies, construction firms, hair-care products makers and car dealerships as especially successful categories. The biggest and fastest-growing black company is <ORGANIZATION> TLC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beatrice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a food manufacturer and distributor formed from the $ 985 million leveraged buyout of <ORGANIZATION> Beatrice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>. In a leveraged buyout, the acquirer finances the purchase of the target company with sales of its assets or the cash flow of the target company. New York-based <ORGANIZATION> TLC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beatrice </ORGANIZATION>, headed by Wall Street attorney <PERSON> Reginald </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, was the first black company to make more than $ 1 billion in annual sales and reported revenue of $ 1.8 billion in 1987. The company's 61 businesses include Butterball turkeys and Good Humor ice cream. The buyout of <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON> `` places <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> on the cutting edge of corporate finance and gives him access to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, three of the world's fastest-growing markets,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> survey says. Other black entrepreneurs _ such as <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc.-Jones </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transfer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Suburban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Distributors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> _ have used leveraged buyouts to propel their companies into the top 100. The second-ranked company on the list, <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, saw its growth boosted by its cosmetics and hair-care products and its syndicated television show, according to the report The Chicago-based company, which had $ 201.6 million in sales last year, markets Fashion Fair products and publishes Ebony, Jet and Ebony Man. <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bottling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, No 3 on the list, has grown by purchasing several profitable companies and bottling franchises through joint ventures with other black businesses. The company rang up 1987 sales of $ 166 million. Construction firm H.J. <ORGANIZATION> Russell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> continues to show its strength in competitive bidding for contracts and has aggressively branched out into real estate development with <ORGANIZATION> Gibraltar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the survey says. Fourth-ranked <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>, based in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, posted sales of $ 141.9 million. No. 5 <ORGANIZATION> Motown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> has sought to restructure its operations, infusing $ 38 million into its records subsidiary for the development and promotion of new artists. Los Angeles-based Motown managed to record $ 100 million in sales last year. Hair-care maker <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the only publicly held company on the list at No 19, was hit hardest by the stock market collapse on Oct. 19: its stock dropped from $ 4 a share to just under $ 3. The Chicago-based company, like other black hair-care specialists, continues to battle white-owned giants like <ORGANIZATION> Alberto-Culver </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Revlon </ORGANIZATION> for market share. <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION>' 1987 sales were $ 33.9 million.
