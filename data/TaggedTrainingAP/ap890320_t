<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> minister said Monday that he would drop his church's sponsorship of a Boy Scout troop unless the organization reverses itself and allows a homosexual man to serve on the troop's parents committee. `` I believe the Boy Scout law is a correct one _ to serve God and country,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Ostertag </PERSON>, rector of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barnabas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. `` But I do n't think God or my country trashes people. If the Boy Scouts have departed from that, they should let the sponsoring agencies know they have departed from that old law.'' <PERSON> Ostertag </PERSON> said the homosexual man, who has a son in Troop 13, was one of 16 people appointed to the parents committee, which supervises the activities of the 35 scouts in the troop. He said the Boy Scout organization revoked the man's registration after learning that he was an admitted homosexual. <PERSON> Ostertag </PERSON> would not name the father. The Boy Scouts of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has upheld the decision at the district and regional levels. The case now is before the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> of the Boy Scouts, <PERSON> Ostertag </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Barclay </PERSON> <PERSON> Bollas </PERSON>, a spokesman at the organization's national headquarters in <LOCATION> Irving </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, said Monday that the <ORGANIZATION> Boy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scouts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> has a policy barring membership to homosexuals and has invoked that policy before. `` We do not believe homosexuals make appropriate leaders for a youth organization like the Boy Scouts,'' <PERSON> Bollas </PERSON> said. Both the troop committee and the parents of the scouts have voted to support <PERSON> Ostertag </PERSON>'s campaign on behalf of the man. <PERSON> Ostertag </PERSON> said it is not easy finding volunteers who will take scouts on camping trips and oversee their work on merit badges, especially in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> neighborhood, where many residents are single. `` This is Holy Week, and I feel uncomfortable celebrating Good Friday and then having to turn around to this man and say, ` You're trash, and we do n't want you around,''' the minister said `` I do n't go for that.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Monday defended his lifelong membership in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> while voicing support for a `` constitutionally sound'' further crackdown on semiautomatic weapons. `` We are in different times now and I am convinced that reasonable men and women can work together to find an answer to the problem,'' he told a group of women state legislators at the White House. Meanwhile, White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> called for a cooling down of emotions in the gun-control dispute, saying `` the president feels we do n't need to be threatening each other.'' He was referring to news reports that <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> officials had indirectly threatened drug czar <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> with political retaliation if he pursues a course toward more firearms restrictions _ allegations that the gun owner's lobby denied anew Monday. `` This is not a time to be threatening people, but rather a time to try to work together to solve a problem that clearly needs to be solved,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. While considering gun measures, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is also looking at moves to fight the drug problem in the nation's capital, including the possible use of federal troops, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is willing to consider bringing in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> under federal command, or using regular military forces, if the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> police force is unable to curb <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s mounting murder rate, the newspaper reported in its Tuesday editions. The administration has not detailed how the Guard might be used, the newspaper said. The administration last week announced it was banning the import of semiautomatic weapons. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had said the move reflected a `` pulse change'' on his part on the subject of gun control, which in the past he has steadfastly opposed. `` Clearly there's been some evolution of his -LRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s -RRB- thinking'' on gun control, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said Monday. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has directed <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> to review the entire subject of semiautomatic weapons. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said that neither an expansion of the ban nor other new restrictions on guns would be proposed during the overall review that <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> is overseeing. The president told his audience: `` On the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION>, of which I'm a member _ a proud member, I might add _ I believe that we can find accommodation between the legitimate interests of the sportsman and the interest of the police chiefs in protecting their people who put their lives on the line every single day.'' `` The country needs to know that there is some answer to this. I do n't yet know what it is,'' he said. While much of the answer rests with the states, `` we have a responsibility'' at the federal level as well, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` We have got to give the police proper support when they lay their lives on the line for us. And so we'll find some answer that is constitutionally sound and that also protects the lives, as best one can from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, of police officers.'' Sources who spoke on condition of anonymity told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> last week that <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> had been receiving warnings from the rifle association through third parties hinting that <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION>'s campaign fund-raising abilities might be used against him if he ever sought political office. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said through a spokesman, <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, that `` there have been a lot of phone calls, a lot of pressure. Let's cool off.'' <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> LaPierre </PERSON>, legislative director for the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION>, insisted Monday that `` we never made a threat in the first place. It's not the way we operate, it's not the way the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> functions. I do n't know how to be any clearer than that.'' He said that the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> shares the nation's `` heightened outrage about violent crime'' on the nation's streets. `` We want to be a part of the solution, we're going to be in there in a constructive way.'' But, he said in an interview, `` we do n't believe we should be pushed into a cosmetic solution that wo n't address the real issues and wo n't solve the real problems.'' `` There's nothing new about semiautomatic firearms. They've been around for a century,'' he said. He claimed the problem was failure to use existing laws to prosecute drug dealers who use guns illegally. `` It's not that we do n't know who these people are: they glow in the dark.'' Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, meanwhile, said he had not heard about alleged <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> threats against <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> but `` if they're saying that they should n't.'' `` <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s doing a good job. The president is very serious about what he has had to say,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 The right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> claimed victory in Sunday's presidential election scarred by clashes between rebels and troops that left at least 29 dead. Three journalists also were killed. The alliance, known as Arena, said its candidate gained more than 50 percent of the vote. That would be enough to avoid a runoff election next month against the incumbent <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>. `` We are sure and we proclaim oursevles the victors,'' <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Aubuisson </PERSON>, founder of <PERSON> Arena </PERSON>, told a news conference. Arena presidential candidate <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> said the party had results from 75 percent of the polling places and he was assured of victory. Election authorities said preliminary officials results were expected Monday. A boycott by leftist rebels and scattered gun battles between guerrillas and troops trimmed the voter turnout. Six soldiers and 23 guerrillas were killed in battles as the rebels tried to disrupt the voting, according to Col. <PERSON> Emilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON>, chief of the joint chiefs of staff. Two Salvadoran journalists and a Dutch television cameraman also were killed _ one during clash at a rebel-held town and the others at military checkpoints. <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidate <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mena </PERSON> had said he expected to do better in the countryside than in the capital, but <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s Channel 12 television station said <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> was running strongly enough to win a clear majority. The Christian Democrat headquarters was virtually deserted Sunday night and the party provided no results. `` We have the 50 percent that is needed to win and I can assure you there will be no second round,'' said <PERSON> D'Aubuisson </PERSON>. `` I am proud to have been able to carry such a good and capable man as <PERSON> Freddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> to the presidency.'' Critics claim <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> is still controlled by <PERSON> D'Aubuisson </PERSON>, a retired army major who has been accused of having links with rightist death squads. <PERSON> D'Aubuisson </PERSON> has repeatedly denied the allegations. Polls closed at 5 p.m. -LRB- 6 p.m. EST -RRB-. There was no official word on turnout, but a spot check by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> at several polling places in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> showed between 55 and 65 percent of those registered had cast ballots. <PERSON> Ana </PERSON> <PERSON> Guadalupe </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, a rebel spokeswoman in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, said enough people had stayed away from the polls to prove that no election could be held without participation by the guerrillas' <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> She said no polling places or voters had been attacked, as the guerrillas had pledged, but rebel assaults on government installations prevented the army from taking voters to the polls. The guerrillas had imposed a transport ban and sabotaged telephone lines and electricity, which cut or restricted power to 80 percent of the country. Roman Catholic churches were crowded with Palm Sunday worshipers and by midday there were long lines of voters at polling stations in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. Turnout was light in many smaller towns. `` With these problems it's better to stay home,'' said <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortiz </PERSON>, 23. He spoke in front of his home in the capital as guerrillas retreated from an assault on a military post three blocks away. Sporadic rifle fire echoed from the slope of the Guazapa volcano, a guerrilla stronghold north of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, as troops fought insurgents in the 9-year-old war that has claimed an estimated 70,000 lives. There were seven presidential candidates and the three major ones were <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>, <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mena </PERSON> and <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ungo </PERSON> of the leftist Democratic Convergence. <PERSON> Christiani </PERSON> and <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mena </PERSON> were the only contenders with a chance to win. Christian Democrat President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s five-year term ends June 1. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>, barred by law from running for re-election, is <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s staunchest ally in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. He is dying of liver cancer. <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> has vowed to follow free-market policies and reduce state intervention in the eonomy. His party promised to step up the war if the guerrillas of the <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> do not agree to lay down their arms. <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> voted Sunday morning in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and told a group of his supporters, `` I hope the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> realizes that -LRB- Salvadorans -RRB- want democracy, with this effort they're making to vote. We do n't want any more bombs.'' <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mena </PERSON> is a lawyer and heads the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>' conservative wing He struggled against opposition charges of corruption in the government and inability of the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> to deal with the economy and the civil war. Leaders of the Democratic Convergence maintain formal links with the guerrillas. This is the first election since 1977 in which socialist candidates have competed. About 1.83 million people out of a population of 5 million were eligible to vote. Polls opened at 7 a.m. in 243 of the country's 262 municipalities and closed at 5 p.m. Nineteen towns in the north did not set up voting stations because election officials deemed those rebel-held zones too dangerous. In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sebastian </LOCATION>, 30 miles east of the capital, turnout was light. `` The people are frightened,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Doherty </PERSON> of the American <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>. `` There is no question that the intimidation by the -LRB- guerrillas -RRB- is working.'' <PERSON> Doherty </PERSON> is one of 21 congressmen, state politicians and private citizens named by the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to be official election observers. He said turnout Sunday was `` far less'' than during three previous elections he attended this decade. <PERSON> Cornel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lagrouw </PERSON>, a cameraman for Dutch national television, was killed as army troops moved to oust guerrillas occupying the eastern town of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <PERSON> Javier </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Gentile </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> photographer for <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Lagrouw </PERSON> was part of a group of six journalists and two drivers who were in the town. The others dragged him away and fled in two cars, but they came under repeated helicopter fire despite press markings and white flags on the vehicles, <PERSON> Gentile </PERSON> said. The military said it had no immediate information on the report. Two Salvadoran journalists were killed and another seriously wounded when security forces fired on their vehicles. The armed forces said the vehicles failed to heed orders to stop at roadblocks. In the March 1988 elections for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> won 32 seats, the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> 23 and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conciliation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> six. But a group called the <ORGANIZATION> Authentic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> split from the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, taking 16 seats from <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s faction. The next legislative elections are set for March 1991.

 <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldin </PERSON> wants to substitute five words in the state civil code with two words that supporters say would undo years of anti-gay discrimination and opponents say would undermine society's structure. The change <PERSON> Goldin </PERSON> wrote in a proposed code revision, unanimously endorsed by the <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> directors, would define marriage as a `` personal relation arising out of a civil contract between two people.'' Under the law now, it's between `` a man and a woman.'' The change would have let <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkin </PERSON> take a three-day leave after the death of his lover of 11 years. His employer would n't let him off, though a co-worker got time off for the death of a stepmother he had never met. It would have made it easier for <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitchens </PERSON> and her partner to adopt. <PERSON> Hitchens </PERSON>, an attorney, had to become the child's guardian, leaving her partner with no legal parental authority until they successfully challenged the law; ultimately, they legally adopted two children. It also would force hospitals to allow a gay AIDS patient's lover into intensive care. Many only let in relatives. Gay couples live in a `` limbo-like state outside of the law,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Keane </PERSON>, president of the local association. `` It's a pariah-type class that's set up within the law. To me, it's an unfairness issue.'' Redefining marriage to include homosexuals would grant all the rights, privileges _ and burdens _ of marriage to gay couples. Among the areas affected if the proposal is made into law are tax exemptions, inheritance laws, pensions and health plans, as well as parenting privileges and adoption rights. `` We're not for it,'' said <PERSON> Deacon </PERSON> <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, spokesman for Catholic Archbishop <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON>. `` To us, marriage is a sacrament with deeply religious overtones. Our church believes marriage can only be entered into by a male and a female.'' <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> believes some inequities may warrant compensation, but calls for use of contracts `` that do n't establish a quasi-marriage.'' The resolution must survive two local reviews to be considered by the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delegates </ORGANIZATION> in September, when about 500 representatives of the state's 117,000 lawyers will consider and propose new laws and and plan repeal efforts. If it passes, Bar lobbyists will seek a legislative sponsor. The specification of `` a man and a woman'' became law in 1977 after a spate of gay marriages, which were n't prohibited then. Under the amendment signed by Gov. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, homosexuals have little say regarding partners' medical care and can not share insurance coverage or health benefits. In <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> city governed by a majority of gay city officials, unmarried city employees may add their partners to health benefit and pension plans. <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Santa </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON> offer similar benefits. In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, where an estimated 10 percent of residents are gay, <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supervisors </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Britt </PERSON>, the panel's only gay member, has spent years trying to provide sweeping rights to `` alternative families.'' <PERSON> Goldin </PERSON>, who is not gay, is a member of the bar association. She said her proposal also would include child custody, community property and spousal support obligations. Supporters do n't anticipate throngs of gay couples flocking to the altar, but they insist that everyone should have the opportunity _ and equal rights. Auto insurance companies that offer family reductions exclude homosexuals and unmarried heterosexual couples, and income tax laws favor married couples in some ways, according to <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> of the Lesbian Rights Project. `` So long as benefits are given or taken away based on relationship status, then we want access to them as well,'' said <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON>, an attorney with National Gay Rights Advocates. Like many lesbians, <PERSON> Hitchens </PERSON> says she would marry if she could. After 12 years with her partner and two adopted children, she said economics _ not emotion _ would prompt her to tie the legal knot. <PERSON> Brinkin </PERSON>, who lost a court battle against his employer over bereavement leave for the death of <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Reich </PERSON>, is n't sure whether he would marry. `` My commitment comes from my heart and I do n't need a piece of paper to do that.'' Advocates of the change say the issue is purely a question of law, that the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment of the Constitution prohibits discrimination against classes of people and should cover homosexuals. `` My guess is that the debate is going to be much more sociological than legal,'' said <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Wied </PERSON>, president of the State Bar. `` Society would recoil at this idea. My guess is that lawyers will follow suit.''

 <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Braschi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> were regarded by friends as a loving couple, their <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> apartment the home of `` any happily married couple.'' But <PERSON> Braschi </PERSON> faces eviction because their landlord disagrees. When <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> died in <PERSON> Braschi </PERSON>'s arms in 186, <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON>'s name was on the lease to the rent-controlled apartment the two men had shared for a decade. Leases pass from parent to child or spouse to spouse under the rent control laws in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s tight and pricy real estate market. <PERSON> Braschi </PERSON> says that as a `` family member'' he should have succession rights even though his name was n't on the lease. The landlord, <ORGANIZATION> Stahl </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, maintains <PERSON> Braschi </PERSON> had no right to the desirable apartment because he was not a member of <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON>'s `` traditional family unit ... those related by blood, marriage or adoption.'' According to <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoddard </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Lambda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>, a gay rights group, `` The case is about individuals who live in families that vary from the <PERSON> Ozzie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harriet </PERSON> mold.'' State court Judge <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Baer </PERSON> ruled that the men were a family under the rent-control law because of `` the time, love and commitment given by <PERSON> Braschi </PERSON> to <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Baer </PERSON> halted the eviction, but was overturned on appeal. The Court of Appeals, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s highest court, will hear arguments April 26. <PERSON> Braschi </PERSON> is allowed to stay in the apartment while the case is in court. `` It's not just a question for gay people,'' <PERSON> Stoddard </PERSON> said. `` It's an issue about the right of each individual to enter into a non-traditional, non-orthodox relationship and be protected by the law.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> must decide whether people in non-traditional living arrangements _ homosexuals, unmarried heterosexuals, even elderly couples _ have the same protection as married couples and blood relatives. The court ruled in 1984 that one member of a homosexual couple could n't adopt the other to keep from being evicted from an apartment that only allowed family members to live together. `` This is the most important case in the country dealing with non-traditional family arrangements,'' said <PERSON> Stoddard </PERSON>. The court's decision could affect insurance, hospital visiting rights, inheritance and other areas in which the definition of `` family'' is crucial <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> had hired <PERSON> Braschi </PERSON> to manage his exclusive <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> beauty salon and made him sole beneficiary, leaving him $ 5 million. <PERSON> Braschi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> exchanged bracelets in 1977 as a symbol of their commitment. <PERSON> Braschi </PERSON>, 33, now wears both. He cared for <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> during the final months of his life and was holding <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> in his arms when he died in September 1986. <PERSON> Braschi </PERSON>, 33, says he and <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> `` regarded one another ... as spouses.'' `` Their friends regarded them as a ` married couple' and their apartment as ` the home of any happily married couple,''' according to court papers. <ORGANIZATION> Stahl </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> has argued that the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> never extended succession rights to `` members of a non-traditional family unit,'' and has accused <PERSON> Braschi </PERSON> of trying to turn the case into a `` referendum on homosexual rights.'' <PERSON> Braschi </PERSON>'s lawyers say <PERSON> Stahl </PERSON> is trying to create that impression `` to prejudice the atmosphere,'' and that the case is simply about family rights. `` What this case is about is people's relationships, whether they will be protected, based on the strength of the relationship,'' said <PERSON> Nan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>, a lawyer for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, which represents <PERSON> Braschi </PERSON>. `` It -LRB- speaks -RRB- in terms of family relationships.

The anonymous caller told Egyptair that a bomb was set to explode at 10:05 p.m. in the arrivals building, <PERSON> Ebert </PERSON> said. Some 300 to 400 people were evacuated from the east wing of the building at about 8:20 p.m., <PERSON> Ebert </PERSON> said. They were permitted to return at about 10 p.m., he said. <PERSON> Ebert </PERSON> said the scare `` delayed whatever flights were there for several hours, whatever flights would have been going out of the east wing. The Egyptair flight that was going to take off did n't until the whole thing was over. No information was available on the bag's contents and police could not immediately determine its owner, <PERSON> Ebert </PERSON> said.

 Those who doubted opera is for high-brows got a sharp reminder at a casting call for a production of <PERSON> Verdi </PERSON>'s `` Aida.'' About 2,000 people hoping to play soldiers, slaves and other extra roles in the extravaganza planned for next month began lining up in the rain at 6 a.m. Saturday for auditions at B.C. Place Stadium. Ads seeking extras had said the minimum height requirement for women was 5-feet-2 and 5-feet-8 for men. But when the stadium doors opened four hours later, the women were told anyone under 5-foot-6 was out of luck. `` We started a mass rebellion,'' said student <PERSON> June </PERSON> <PERSON> Derlachter </PERSON>, who is 5-feet-4 -LCB-. After haggling, folks 5-foot-4 and above were told they could stay. `` A lot of short people cheated by wearing high heels,'' complained Ms. <PERSON> Derlachter </PERSON>, who made it inside but was not among the 503 people selected. Production manager <PERSON> Serge </PERSON> <PERSON> Bilodeau </PERSON> said he could not explain how the mixup on heights occurred. The two-day production of the opera about <PERSON> Aida </PERSON>'s romance during a war between <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> is scheduled for April 27 and 29.

 This town's one-man police force says officials have idled his squad car because he wo n't turn the town into a speed trap. `` Out of gas: mayor and city council refuse to buy gas'' reads a plywood sign on top of the car parked at <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Villemarette </PERSON>'s house. `` They're wishing that I'd quit. But I'm too old in this game to quit that easy,'' said <PERSON> Villemarette </PERSON>, police chief and only officer in this central <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> village of about 800. <PERSON> Villemarette </PERSON> claims Mayor <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeansonne </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aldermen </ORGANIZATION> want him out of office and have heated up a long-running feud over speeding tickets since he won re-election in October to a third term. He says he encouraged two part-time patrolmen to quit by giving them bad working hours after the board urged the officers to set traps. `` They'd park on the edge of town near the speed zone signs. A person from <LOCATION> Marksville </LOCATION> comes cruising in ... and they would stop that person, no questions asked. To me, that's a big ripoff. `` Or they would be hiding in the brush waiting for a nice little family to come down. I do n't go for all that malarkey,'' the police chief said. But <PERSON> Jeansonne </PERSON> said the board decided to allocate $ 50 a month for gasoline instead of reimbursing the chief an average of $ 275 a month because the squad car is driven much less. `` Most times, his car is parked at City Hall or the Baptist church,'' <PERSON> Alderman </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Gauthier </PERSON> complained. While the dispute simmers, <PERSON> Villemarette </PERSON> said, he will use his own car to answer police calls.

<TEXT>
 The selection of a shrewd, affable pragmatist as President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s successor is contributing to a surge of hope for a peaceful breakthrough in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s political stalemate. So far, however, the optimistic musings are coming almost exclusively from whites. Black leaders make clear they will be relieved when <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> steps down. But they suspect his heir apparent, F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, will preside over changes more cosmetic than substantive. <PERSON> Mangosuthu </PERSON> <PERSON> Buthelezi </PERSON>, the Zulu political leader denounced by many black activists as too conservative, says he will oppose de Klerk until the government gives blacks full voting rights. There is no sign de Klerk contemplates such action. At the other end of the black political spectrum, the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla movement says changes under de Klerk will be in personal style, not National Party policy. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> and <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> `` are pieces of the same carcass,'' spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sebina </PERSON> said from the outlawed movement's exile headquarters in <LOCATION> Lusaka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>. `` If the meat is bad, the meat is bad.'' <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, 73, resumed his presidential duties last week after an eight-week convalescence from a stroke. In the interim, he resigned as <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader and was replaced by <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, the minister of national education. In a dramatic chain of events, Nationalist newspapers and politicians began suggesting that <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> should retire, <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> responded by declaring he would stay in office until next year, and the party's parliamentary caucus resolved that it wanted <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> to be president. However, the party has neither the constitutional power nor the appetite to force <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> from office. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> said Friday he will seek cordial coexistence with the president while urging his party to `` break new ground'' in pursuing political reform. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, who turned 53 Saturday, has never been viewed as liberal. But supporters and skeptics alike depict him as more open-minded and less imperious than <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, who has headed the government since 1978. After becoming party leader, <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> called for a <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> `` free of domination and oppression.'' Other party officials say at least some remaining apartheid laws _ those segregating residential areas and public facilities _ may be modified. <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Suzman </PERSON>, long-serving legislator for the anti-apartheid <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said of de Klerk: `` People are being too optimistic if they think he is going to throw fundamental policy overboard.'' `` But I think he's pragmatic and intelligent,'' she said. `` He realizes that change is absolutely inevitable, that the sooner we get on with it, the more chance there is that change and reform will be accomplished peacefully.'' <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> does not have the same close ties to the military and police that <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> nurtured. But he is committed firmly to segregating neighborhoods and schools for whites who want them, and his proposal for `` genuine power sharing'' with blacks as yet has no substance. His ascendency coincides with other developments that have induced the broadest optimism about <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> since black unrest broke out in 1984. British Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said last week `` encouraging changes'' were unfolding in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. These include major foreign policy initiatives, such as independence for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> and rapprochement with <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> after prolonged hostility. But anti-apartheid leaders view seemingly notable domestic developments with skepticism. For example, a government-appointed law commission attracted international publicity this month by calling for a bill of rights, abolition of apartheid laws and full voting rights for blacks. Human rights activists doubted the proposals would be implemented, and the government reacted with silence. Similarly, black clergymen were unimpressed when delegates from the white <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reformed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, to which most National Party officials belong, issued a statement describing apartheid as a sin. Last week the full policy-making body of the Afrikaner church balked at endorsing the delegates' stance. The government spurned recent suggestions by <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reformed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Johan </PERSON> <PERSON> Heyns </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Beeld </ORGANIZATION>, a major Afrikaans-language newspaper, that it drop its demand the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> renounce violence before negotiations are held. There is no indication jailed <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> will be freed soon. One of the most informed assessments of <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> came in a recent magazine article by his brother, <PERSON> Willem </PERSON>, a former newspaper editor who quit the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> out of disenchantment with apartheid. <PERSON> Willem </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> described his brother as `` fair, friendly and humble,'' but committed to the ideology of separating racial groups. `` If F.W can give the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> a new credibility among all population groups, and in international politics, he will herald a breakthrough toward a new future. But if he continues along the old path, he will merely be a transitional figure who will let us keep treading water,'' he said.

 <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>'s security force often erforms duties such as babysitting, running personal errands and soliciting home telephone numbers from new female acquaintances, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reports. The Post, in its Monday editions, said two city-paid security officials babysat the mayor's son and a playmate while the mayor was in a hotel 20 minutes away during a trip to the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> last year. The paper quoted a model identified as <PERSON> Grace </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shell </PERSON> as saying that one of the mayor's security officers approached her for her telephone number in 1987. About two dozen security officers make up the $ 1 million-a-year detail. The paper said police officials have voiced concern that the mayor often requires the officers to station themselves a few blocks away or at the police garage where the security detail is based. `` The security detail should not be leaving the mayor anywhere,'' the paper quoted one high-ranking police official as saying. Mayoral spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> said he had received no official notification of any practice of using security officers for babysitting or personal errands while <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> is left unprotected. White said it is important for the mayor to be adequately protected, adding, `` From time to time, the mayor has had threats against his life and his family. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> has been dogged by recent allegations that he has used drugs and by charges of drug-selling lodged in the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> against a former associate, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, whom <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> had visited several times at a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> hotel in December.

 By day, she was a lowly House of Commons researcher. By night, she dated a government minister and newspaper editors, and mingled with the upper crust. With the allegation that she's also a call girl, it all adds up to the kind of yarn on which <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s tabloid newspapers thrive. And if the headlines are to be believed, this one even has a <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> connection. According to the stories dominating front pages in recent days, the striking former <ORGANIZATION> Miss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> worked as a part-time researcher for <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> lawmaker <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> from late December to late February. The job, apparently involving research for legislation <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> sponsored to end price-fixing in the book trade, entitled the 27-year-old aide to a security pass that gave her access to much of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION>. On Sunday, the News of the World alleged the woman _ identified variously as <PERSON> Pamella </PERSON> <PERSON> Bordes </PERSON>, <PERSON> Pamella </PERSON> <PERSON> Bardes </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> _ also works as a call girl, charging at least $ 860 a night. The newspaper attributed its information to an `` investigator'' who spoke with her in a hotel bedroom. Other newspapers rushed into print with an array of pictures of dark-maned Miss <PERSON> Bordes </PERSON> hobnobbing with the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> glitterati. They reprinted pictures of her as Sports Minister <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON>'s date at the Conservative Party Winter Ball. There were photos of her out and about with <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Neil </PERSON>, editor of The Sunday Times and at a party with <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trelford </PERSON>, editor of the rival Observer. No one has suggested there is anything wrong with <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Bordes </PERSON> seeing the high and mighty after hours. But on Friday, the tabloid <ORGANIZATION> Evening </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> introduced a new element: <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. Quoting a close, unidentified friend of Miss <PERSON> Bordes </PERSON>, the Standard said she `` is believed to have close social links with one of revolutionary <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> leader Colonel -LRB- <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>'s closest aides.'' It said she made regular trips to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> to meet <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadaff </PERSON> <PERSON> al </PERSON> <PERSON> Daim </PERSON>, whom the paper identified as a cousin of <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> and a major in the <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> security service. The paper quoted a security source as confirming that <PERSON> al </PERSON> <PERSON> Daim </PERSON>'s movements are monitored in the West and claimed Miss <PERSON> Bordes </PERSON> made several visits to <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION> by private jet `` The news will have grave security implications for the British government,'' opined the Standard, and some lawmakers were quick to agree. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Leadbitter </PERSON> of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, an expert on espionage, said: `` The persistent reports linking <PERSON> Pamella </PERSON> <PERSON> Bordes </PERSON> with people in prominent positions _ and more recently actually touching upon areas of possible security risk _ suggest, if true, the urgency of the government undertaking the fullest possible pressing and penetrating inquiry.'' The Today newspaper has already dubbed Miss <PERSON> Bordes </PERSON> `` the new <PERSON> Keeler </PERSON>,'' referring to the former call girl whose simultaneous affairs with War Minister <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Profumo </PERSON> and a Soviet diplomat rocked a <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> government 26 years ago. On Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s largest circulation newspaper, quoted an acquaintance, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, as saying Miss <PERSON> Bardes </PERSON> told him: `` My secrets could bring down the government, just like <PERSON> Christine </PERSON> <PERSON> Keeler </PERSON> did.'' What these `` secrets'' might be, nobody knows. Miss <PERSON> Bordes </PERSON> has not publicly commented on her newfound notoriety and has not surfaced in public. But if she was correctly quoted, said <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell-Savors </PERSON>, `` then I'm sure many members of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> will wonder, to put it bluntly, what the hell is going on.'' Her security pass was yanked as soon as her name hit the headlines, and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION> security rules are to be tightened next month.

<TEXT>
 Christian-in-Wonderland did it again. After the patchwork blaze of color in his winter ready-to-wear collection last week, <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Lacroix </PERSON> topped his own act Sunday with a second show, the more expensive and sublime `` luxe'' collection. Often capping the outfits with his favorite `` Mad Hatter'' hat, he showed rich clothes in the line he nicknamed `` jogging to Byzantium.'' <PERSON> Lacroix </PERSON> led off with a bronze taffeta belted trench coat with a grand fox collar, followed up by a tangerine long wraparound skirt topped with a beaver-collared raspberry jacket. Soft imitation leopard added more deluxe touches to jacket linings, big stoles and an occasional turban cap. Little short fitted suits with flared bell skirts came out in stained-glass shades of <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Killim </LOCATION> rug patterns. His favorite trapeze-shaped topper looked great with deep mink cuffs on hot orange-red bouclette wool over a mildly flared skirt. A fabulous, egg-shaped, carnation pink, iridescent taffeta coat over a salmon satin suit was breathtaking. For evening wear, rich women might choose the strapless dresses in `` Fortuny'' panne velvets with strapless bosoms draped in lame. The gold of <PERSON> Byzantium </PERSON> was shot through the collection, even for evening blazers with paisley patterns in the brocade. And Goldfinger himself could n't have faulted the shimmering lame trouser outfit with flared pants. Never one to shy away from color and opulence, <PERSON> Lacroix </PERSON> laid on both in plenty, especially for evening. But he did it with such a light touch that the audience was dazzled. The grand finale was a group of Oriental `` odalisque'' outfits with harem pants in turquoise, red and gold iridescent panne velvets. Meanwhile, this versatile designer is already well into his next project: designing 350 costumes for a spectacular production of `` Carmen'' to take place in early July in the ancient arena at <LOCATION> Nimes </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Lacroix </LOCATION>'s native <LOCATION> Arles </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Provence </LOCATION>. This time, he's putting all his inventiveness into costumes for the American stars of the opera, <PERSON> Grace </PERSON> <PERSON> Bumbry </PERSON> and <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Shicoff </PERSON>, singing `` Carmen'' and `` <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Jose </PERSON>.'' `` I grew up with <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON>, a very sexy lady and the first woman in my life,'' <PERSON> Lacroix </PERSON> said in an interview. `` Her outfits will be in gold and white, coral shades and earth colors, depending on the act.'' One sure thing: with <PERSON> Lacroix </PERSON> dressing her, <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Bumbry </PERSON> wo n't look like the down-and-out cigarette girl she will play. Japanese designer <PERSON> Hanae </PERSON> <PERSON> Mori </PERSON> showed a gently demure collection under the rotunda of the old commodities market. The most `` French'' of Oriental designers and the only one to show haute couture as well went in strongly for feminine shapes and soft fabrics. Her navy pinstriped coat-dresses, suits with skirts and pants could n't have been more classic. Diagonally-striped black and turquoise knit outfits were lively but never out of line, lengths just around knee level. Like designers all over town, <LOCATION> Miss </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mori </LOCATION> is seeing spots for next winter, and imitation leopard surged up here in flyaway trapeze shortie coats over narrow black skirts and animal-spotted stockings. For a touch of hot jazz, she showed puffy Tibetan lamb coats dyed in amethyst, royal blue and shocking pink. Iridescent taffeta dresses with cloche-shaped skirts over mounds of crinolines harked back to tea-dances for debutantes in the 1950s. More interesting were the evening outfits in <PERSON> Hanae </PERSON> <PERSON> Mori </PERSON>'s forte, flower-printed silks. This time they were beautiful and bold, in turquoise, peacock, flame with gold, borrowed from the best of Japanese kimono fabrics. On Easter Sunday, Miss Mori will celebrate the opening of her new shop in <LOCATION> Monte </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carlo </LOCATION>, by presenting the collection at a charity gala for `` Les Oeuvres de Soeur Marie,'' which benefits underprivileged and elderly people. Princess <PERSON> Caroline </PERSON> will host the event for about 700 guests. <PERSON> Maryll </PERSON> <PERSON> Lanvin </PERSON>'s collection was eclectic, bright and attractive, aimed at women who frequent the best shops, clubs and restaurants. As usual, the clothes were young and well-cut, mainstream rather than trend-setting. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and big bands of violet piping were combined happily in a daytime group that had short flannel skirts, pants, shetland blazers and boleros. Worth noting were her big, bold diagonal plaids, in shades of yellow, red, emerald, purple. Fuzzy plaid mohair coats and flyaway short trapeze coats looked outstanding over suits with long shetland jackets and lean dark skirts. Another new plaid was multicolored windowpane style on a dark boucle fabric. It was striking in suits with both pants and short or longer skirts - the easy alternatives here. The shimmering dresses with hip-bloused tops and leg o'mutton sleeves or shifts were looked pleasingly different in their outsized paisley patterns. Sleekly fitted moire dresses in gem colors with short skirts flaring at the hem are made to order for little dinners or big cocktail parties. And <PERSON> Lanvin </PERSON>'s late-day wear was best in fitted quilted silk jackets with splatter motifs on very bright colors over dark silk jersey skirts or flowing pajamas.

<DATELINE>OXFORD, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The 5,000 `` new'' words in the second edition of the Oxford English Dictionary say more about the glacial pace of lexicography than about the age of the words. There are freshly minted terms such as AIDS-related, antiquark, fax, <ORGANIZATION> Filofax </ORGANIZATION> and ghetto-blaster; words or word senses redolent of the 1960s such as acid, downer, grok and chopper, and jazz-age coinages such as Big Apple. There's even one new word from Anglo-Saxon: `` ash,'' the symbol that combines the letters A and E. The second edition, to be published March 29, reflects more than a century of scholarly labor. It pulls together the 400,000 entries in the first edition, completed between 1879 and 1928; the first supplement of 1933; the four-volume second supplement of 1972-1986; and the 5,000 new entries. That chronology explains why the OED took so long to catch up with `` Big Apple,'' <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s nickname. The first use of the term recorded by the dictionary is in 1927, though `` we've since heard there was record of it in 1906,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, the co-editor responsible for new words in the second edition. `` Now, in the first edition of OED the letter B came out in 1885, 1886, so -LRB- Big Apple -RRB- was n't available for inclusion then. `` I think it was a pity it was n't included in the supplement. Perhaps it was n't really widely well known. I do n't know.'' <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> also does n't know why his entry for `` Pythonesque,'' inspired by the satirical lunacies of comedy troupe called <PERSON> Monty </PERSON> <PERSON> Python </PERSON>'s Flying Circus, was ultimately rejected by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Burchfield </PERSON>, editor of the second supplement. `` So I thought, I've had enough of that, so I put it back in again for the second edition,'' <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> said. `` Nobody objected so it's gone in.'' Also inducted: acid rain, acupressure, barf, bleeper, creation science, detox, <ORGANIZATION> Diner </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, dingbat, duty-free, endangered, est, fast track, foxy, Great Leap Forward, greenmail, lap-top, nose job, passive smoking, plastic money and Visa. From now on, the 20-volume dictionary will be subject to rapid updating because this edition was prepared on a computer. <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> hopes to offer it on computer discs by 1991. The computer version will solve the age-old problem of looking up a word you ca n't remember. The computer can look for definitions, and much more. The basic work of lexicography, however, is still done on index cards, now numbering in excess of 3 million, each containing a quotation found by a paid or volunteer reader to illustrate the use of a word. The method is the same used by <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A.H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON>, the first editor of the OED, who took on what was supposed to be a 10-year task in 1879 and had completed the letter T at his death in 1915. <PERSON> Murray </PERSON>, who appears in photos looking like an Old Testament figure in mortarboard and long white beard, instructed his researchers to `` make a quotation for every word that strikes you as rare, obsolete, old-fashioned, new, peculiar, or used in a peculiar way.'' They were also asked to produce as many quotations as possible for ordinary words. The OED surveys English from the middle of the 12th century, and the research net covered the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australasia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and the English-speaking parts of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>. `` We regard the OED as an international dictionary now,'' said co-editor <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON>. That's reflected in its production. The dictionary was edited in <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION>, the computer program was developed by the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Waterloo </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>, the text was keyboarded in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, and the 10,000 sets, each weighing 137.7 pounds, were printed in <LOCATION> Taunton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. It's hard to explain exactly when a word becomes so widely used that it qualifies for the OED, <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON> said, but in practice words are almost always added by consensus, based on citations from printed sources. `` It is not our job to lay down what standard English is,'' said <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON>, but to produce a photograph of English as it is used. `` The dictionary records the language, warts and all,'' <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> said. `` I would say we do n't prescribe ourselves, but we try to make it obvious in the entries if you are dealing with a particular use that a group of people dislike.'' If a word is misused enough, it may rate an entry. Thus, contractural, a common misspelling of contractual, earned a citation in the OED, <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> said. Some day, it may be the standard spelling. ` Over history, over and over again, you see what was originally a non-standard variation becoming standard, and the standard one becoming old-fashioned and falling out of use,'' <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON> said. `` These days, ` disinterested' is condemned when being used in the sense of not interested, but actually it's older in that sense. ... `` We can only report that people, grammarians or whatever, said that a usage was wrong,'' <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON> said. `` But very often you will find in the quotations that <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON> or <PERSON> Dryden </PERSON> or whoever actually did use this supposedly wrong usage, and that rather confounds the extreme prescriptivist point of view.''

<HEAD>U.S. Agencies Apparently In Conflict Over Rocket Fuel Bound For Iran</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Customs officials are trying to block a shipment of a rocket fuel component allegedly headed for <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, but a lack of cooperation between federal agencies could help free the chemical soon, it was reported. A shipment large enough to fuel 300 military missiles was seized in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in February 1988 when <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agents said it was being loaded onto an Iranian freighter, according to Sunday's <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. But the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> issued a special export license to the chemical's owner, blocking Customs' court fight to forbid the shipment, the newspaper said. A federal judge in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> issued a temporary injunction requiring the government to release the 1,144 drums of ammonium perchlorate last week. Another hearing is scheduled for today. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Sim </PERSON> <PERSON> Lake </PERSON> ruled the rocket fuel ingredient was not among munitions restricted for shipment to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> by the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and that Customs failed to prove the shipment was bound for <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The 286,000 pounds of the rocket fuel component shipped from <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> in January 1988 by <ORGANIZATION> Grindius </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, was seized the following month as it was being loaded onto an Iranian freighter in the <LOCATION> Dutch </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Rotterdam </LOCATION>. The shipment was being sent during the Iran-Iraq war, when those countries were using surface-to-surface missiles. <PERSON> Grindius </PERSON> contends it never intended to sell the chemical to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The shipping bill of lading shows it was bound for a buyer in <LOCATION> Basel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. Following the seizure, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> issued a special export license covering the shipment. The <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> has urged the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to revoke the license. The department has declined to do so and would n't comment on the case pending its court outcome. Customs officials also said the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is not sure whether it will pursue the agency's case because of <PERSON> Lake </PERSON>'s initial ruling. Lake blamed a lack of cooperation and communication between the various governmental agencies for the apparent conflict. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> exports between 1 million and 2 million pounds of ammonium perchlorate every year, mostly to friendly nations. The compound has been in short supply since May when an explosion in <LOCATION> Henderson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, destroyed a plant operated by <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Production </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the primary manufacturer of ammonium perchlorate.

<HEAD>Documentary Shows Troubles of Elderly Poor</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 `` That's my problem, I'm a survivor,'' said the old woman. As she said it, she raised her blue eyes so they made contact with the social worker sitting across the table and, coincidentally, with the camera. There was a smile on her face as she talked about how strong she was, how strong she had been all her life, how she had always taken care of herself _ and of her husband before he died. But now, she was alone and sick and poor and beyond finding much to look forward to on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. The more she talked the sadder she became until she concluded that `` 68 is long enough to live.'' And then she wept. It is but one of several such scenes from a television documentary _ `` On the Other Side of Easy Street'' _ airing this week on Public Broadcasting System stations across the nation. Without exception, the old people put on faces of strength, even humor for the camera. But they are not actors and, also without exception, their eyes reflect despair and, in some cases, a bewildered sense that they thought it was n't supposed to turn out this way. Indeed, that is the central point to the film: that despite the Social Security program that has helped keep an increasing proportion of elderly Americans from the poverty that afflicted their own elders, those who remain poor _ well over 3 million _ do so with little hope. `` The film shatters the stereotype that elderly persons are well off and none are poor,'' said <PERSON> Horace </PERSON> <PERSON> Deets </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retired </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Persons </ORGANIZATION>. `` ... So many people struggle every day to retain some dignity in the face of extreme poverty.'' <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Villers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, which financed the film along with <ORGANIZATION> AARP </ORGANIZATION>, said after a preview screening that the problems portrayed in the film `` are not insoluble.'' `` Frankly, it's a question of political will,'' said <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON>, who made the point that _ unlike younger and healthier people _ the elderly have little prospect of working their way out of poverty. While not a pleasant viewing experience, the film drives home the point that even the best laid plans do n't always turn out. And it shows that cutting through government red tape to get available benefits is not the easiest thing to do, especially for a new widow reeling from the death of her husband from a long illness that wiped out what they thought would be a financial cushion. <ORGANIZATION> AARP </ORGANIZATION> issued a study in conjunction with release of the film that showed fewer than half the elderly people eligible for the Supplemental Security Income program, which is supposed to provide a safety net for the poorest of the poor, actually get their benefits. The reasons vary widely from state to state and individual to individual but, in most cases, result from failure of the bureaucracy make the program easily available for those too unsophisticated or too proud to seek it out. For those who do, the maximum benefit is $ 368 per month for an individual and $ 553 per month for a couple.

<TEXT>
 In the aftermath of the brutal <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> battle over former Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>'s attempt to run the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, the tenor of a confirmation hearing seems to be getting, as one senator says, a little bizarre. As evidence, here are a few questions put by Sen. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, to <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> during his confirmation hearing last week to be deputy secretary of state: <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>: Well, let's get to the important questions, Mr. <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON>. ... First of all, have you ever drunk anything stronger than warm milk? <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON>: Yes, sir. -LRB- Laughter -RRB- <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>: Strike one. I notice you smoke, too. Strike two. ... Have you ever in public or private pinched a woman's behind? <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON>: Can I divide that into two questions? -LRB- Laughter -RRB- ... No, sir. The nominee, a man to whom laughter came as easily as diplomatic analysis during the drawn-out hearings, apparently took no offense at <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>'s questions and went on to discuss with him the tragedy of hunger that is gripping the African nation, <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>. The 30-year veteran of government service, who'd accumulated a massive store of goodwill among senators, was swiftly confirmed a day later by the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. But all kidding aside, <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON>'s two days of confirmation hearings served to point out that much confusion remains about what is required of a nominee for high public office, whether in personal standards of conduct, or in attempting to deal with questions of real or apparent conflict of interest. It was clear that the shadow of Tower's ruined quest for confirmation, which foundered on allegations of alcohol abuse, `` womanizing'' and the nominee's $ 1 million in fees as a consultant for defense contractors, haunted <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON>'s nomination, and may well haunt others in the future. Some of the most tense questioning during the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Foreign Relations Committee hearings came from Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, R.-N. He prodded <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> about the more than $ 900,000 in income, bonuses and severance the nominee received during his last of four years with the international consulting firm headed by former Secretary of State <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON>. `` You know the big deal that was made about <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> told <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON>. `` He was a piker compared to your income.'' <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, an arch-conservative who had been a vocal critic of <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON>'s policy of pursuing detente, said he was worried about possible influence by the firm's foreign clients. `` There are a lot of people who wonder whether the advice you might give to the president or the secretary of state might be colored by the ongoing interest of firms, foreign firms ... who have been paying you substantial fees,'' <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> told <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON>. <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> said he had provided analyses of political, economic and societal developments for his clients, many of them multinational corporations, but that he never lobbied the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government on their behalf or engaged in any political activity for them. To return to government and avoid `` even the appearance of a conflict of interest,'' <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> said he cut all ties with <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> <PERSON> Associates </PERSON>, sold all his investment stocks, and volunteered to disqualify himself for a year from any dealings with the 15 clients he'd worked for while at <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON>'s firm and been paid more than $ 5,000. This, his attorney <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> argued, went `` far beyond'' what has customarily been required from government appointees, such as cutting all ties with their former business associates and then being recused on a case-by-case basis on the advice of government ethics attorneys. But <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON>'s actions did not satisfy <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, who said he wanted the names of all of the <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> clients made public, whether <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> had worked for them or not. <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> argued that since <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> had been paid out of a company pot of funds, and not just by the clients he served, it was necessary for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel to have such information. <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> said that was difficult for him, since the list was considered confidential by the company. <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>' request proved too much for Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, D-Del., who argued that `` it's bizarre'' to require a nominee to disqualify himself from all dealings with any client that paid part of his income, even though he'd had no business dealings with them He said such a requirement would have disqualified former Secretary of State <PERSON> Cyrus </PERSON> <PERSON> Vance </PERSON>, former deputy secretary of state <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>, Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>, many of whom had extensive business contacts with huge investment or law firms. `` I think we're getting a little daffy. ... We'll be assured that the only person who'll we'll ever have as a secretary of state will be someone who has a career that is distinguished by doing nothing,'' <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> argued. <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> sought to defuse the problem by offering to disqualify himself from any possible future dealings with any client of the <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> firm from the past two years, even those he did n't work with As well, an `` informal'' arrangement was worked out, <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> said, that did not require the nominee to meet a higher standard than what is required under the law. <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> agreed to disclose the names of the clients to the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> legal adviser, who is obligated to keep them private under an attorney-client relationship, and provide the list to the committee chairman, Sen. <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, who agreed to treat it as a classified document.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Film, Book Focus Attention on History of Congress</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 As <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> goes into its third century, the history of the first two is coming in for some increased attention. It has been a neglected subject, with much more scrutiny focused on the White House at the other end of the central stretch of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION>. Now, however, there is a 724-page book on the history of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, made up of speeches by former Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. Va.. And tonight, most public television stations are carrying a 90-minute special called `` The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' using paintings, photographs, newsreels, sound recordings and narration to depict the 200 years since the first <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> met in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on March 4 Historian <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leuchtenburg </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION>, speaking at a recent gathering at the Capitol to launch <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>'s book, lamented that members of his profession have paid relatively scant attention to congressional history. Others whose business it is to get a balanced view of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> agree with him. `` Few good books have been written about <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> despite the richness of the subject matter,'' <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, who covers the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, wrote recently. In tonight's television program, writer <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> McCullough </PERSON>, the narrator and co-author, stands before a backdrop of the Capitol and says, `` We are so accustomed to seeing our history measured by the presidency that we forget the extent to which the real story of our country takes place right there.'' And it is in fact the building that is in many ways the star of the film, whose producer, <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>, won Academy Award nominations and other honors with previous documentaries about the <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> and Statue of Liberty. Roaming around the Capitol, the camera fixes lovingly on the glowing rotunda, presents speeded-up images of tourists passing the building's monumental statues, focuses on the hands of <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Clay </PERSON> in a 19th-century portrait. It picks out the bust of <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, tucked away in an alcove off the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor along with those of others who presided over the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> as vice president. There is also the voice of <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> MacArthur </PERSON>, interrupted by applause as he tells a joint session of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, `` Old soldiers never die; they just fade away.'' There is even a shot of <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, awed by his first sight of the Capitol dome as he arrives in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to take up his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> duties in the movie classic, `` Mr. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> Goes to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.'' The film deals with the silliness and the back-room deals on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> as well as such high drama as the civil rights debates of the late 1950s and early 1960s. On the whole it is, as <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> told a preview audience at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, `` a very uncynical, though not entirely uncritical, view of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' If all of this sounds to you like a Valentine to an institution that is so often a whipping boy, surely we can count on the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> reporters, those hard-bitten men and women who cover the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, to provide a more realistic and perhaps cynical view. Well, <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> and his colleagues interviewed some of them, so listen: <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> McDowell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> Times-Dispatch and <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, speaking of the Capitol dome. `` It's a hat. It's a very majestic nice hat, but a little bit ludicrous, on something that we all care very much about. ... The people are being represented under that thing; and I can live with that corny thought.'' <PERSON> Cokie </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>: `` It would be a true disaster if the modern demands of security keep <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> children from the ability to just sort of roam the Capitol Building.'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Broder </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Post: `` It's also a kind of a wonderful place, if you just let yourself have the freedom to do it, to stand still for a moment and look at the people who are coming there to see their <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> at work. It's marvelous to see their expressions as the dignity and the beauty of that building reach them for the first time.'' Ms. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> again, on how the lawmakers go about their work: `` I think quite frankly, by the time the whole messy business is over with, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> after <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, that they've done a pretty good job of it.'' So much for cynicism. The film was underwritten by the information industry giant <ORGANIZATION> Ameritech </ORGANIZATION> and co-produced by <ORGANIZATION> WETA </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and Florentine Films. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>'s book, `` The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, 1789-1989,'' is available from the <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Printing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and its depositories around the country for $ 55.

<TEXT>
 Citing a report that found the Superfund program ripe for a contracting scandal, a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel chairman says the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> must avoid the `` morass of abuses'' that have plagued <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> purchasing. The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> concluded in a new report that the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> is letting the growing number of contractors in the Superfund program police themselves on potential conflicts of interest. Procedures are so lax that the agency might not discover a company it hired to investigate a hazardous waste dump also was working for the polluter of the site, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said in a report obtained over the weekend by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mich </LOCATION>., who requested the study, wrote <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> on Friday, `` The Superfund contract program must avoid at all costs the morass of abuses and conflict of interest problems that plague the defense procurement system `` While it is important ... for contractors to have effective internal procedures in place, it is also important that <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> personnel have the independent capability to police the Superfund contract system.'' <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON> is chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and the panel's investigations subcommittee, which has been investigating the Superfund program. The report concluded, `` This system is currently dependent on contractors' identifying and informing appropriate <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> officials about conflicts.'' It warned that a company working for both sides could feed the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> biased data, thereby weakening legal efforts to recover cleanup costs from a polluter. The report said the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> `` relies heavily on contractors to avoid conflicts, but does not review contractors' performance to ensure compliance with <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s conflict of interest requirements.'' The investigators said few conflicts have been found so far, but cautioned, `` This risk is a growing possibility in light of <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s continuing efforts to expand the number of contractors used to perform remedial and technical enforcement activities. In the 1988 fiscal year, more than $ 600 million in contracts were approved by the agency for Superfund projects, compared to $ 97.3 million in fiscal 1982. Superfund, an $ 8.5 billion program to clean up hazardous waste sites, relies increasingly on private companies for the preliminary investigations of polluted sites, because the government has neither the manpower nor the expertise to do the work. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s procurement and contracts management division, said, `` We're not in a position to police every situation with every firm out there. The amount of effort required to do that would just be overwhelming.'' He said a company caught working for both the agency and polluters at the same site could face a ban on <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> work or termination of the contract. `` We could take the position of being purists,'' he said, by prohibiting even `` the appearance'' of a conflict. But he asked, `` How strict can we get in appearance situations and still have companies that will work for us? There is a limited industry. We do n't want to set up private sector contractors vs. public sector contractors.'' The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> investigators looked at seven contracts valued at $ 745 million and involving work at sites all across the country. Five of the contracts were for studies that led to recommendations on how to clean up the sites. Two contracts were for investigating the parties responsible for pollution, so legal cases could be developed for recovery of cleanup costs.

 First Dog <PERSON> Millie </PERSON> and her litter of six pups were reported to be doing fine after a weekend delivery at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, and the Bushes even got congratulated on the new arrivals at a Palm Sunday church service. The First Family _ with the six new canine arrivals _ spent a quiet Sunday close to home after the 2-year-old brown and white English springer spaniel gave birth to one male and five female puppies on Friday night and early Saturday. The Bushes have said they will give away the puppies, with some of them to go to grandchildren. White House aide <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Zanca </PERSON> said Sunday that the pups were expected to remain at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> with <PERSON> Millie </PERSON> for about six weeks. President and Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> attended an early morning worship service at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday, a block from the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, then spent the rest of the day at home. `` Congratulations on the puppies,'' the Rev. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, a rector at the church, said as he greeted them. <PERSON> Millie </PERSON> lost neither her appetite nor her energy from the ordeal and was eating `` several times as much as usual'' and bounding around the White House grounds, according to Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The president, who joined his wife to watch one of the six puppies delivered, described the experience on Saturday as `` really beautiful, it was unbelievable.'' `` The president and I cried when we saw one of them being born. ... We had a tear. It was really sweet,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` It was so beautiful to see her.'' She added that the puppies are `` really cute.'' She said it had been an easy delivery and that, while she played midwife, <PERSON> Millie </PERSON> `` did all the work.'' `` Millie is apparently a very good mother,'' said <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s press secretary. `` The puppies started nursing immediately.

<HEAD>Minimum Wage Up For Floor Debate; GOP Reshuffles House Leadership</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The action in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> this week is in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, which has a minimum wage debate on its agenda as well as items that could reshape the leadership of both parties in the chamber. Little legislation has moved through the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> so far this year, with most of the time spent on the failed plan to raise congressional pay and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> battle over the nomination of <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> lost that one, but his nomination of Rep. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> to the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> post sailed to confirmation last week before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> shut down for a two-week recess. In the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, another fight between majority Democrats and the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> looms. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been adamant in saying he will agree to raise the minimum wage to no more than $ 4.25 an hour by 1992 and only if an accompanying `` training wage'' provision is approved allowing employers to pay new workers $ 3.35 _ the present minimum _ for up to six months. Democrats, mindful of former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s success in blocking any increase, are moving toward accepting some form of training wage but are refusing to scale back their bill, which would boost the minimum to $ 4.65 in three years. Debate in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> is scheduled to begin Wednesday or Thursday, when Republicans will try again to substitute <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal for the Democrats' bill and Democrats tack on their own version of a training wage, one unlikely to meet White House standards. `` I think they want to play hardball with this bill and test the president's mettle,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Armey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>, an aide to Rep. <PERSON> Augustus </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, D-Calif., the sponsor of the bill and chairman of the labor panel, said <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> was reviewing a handful of Democratic proposals for a training wage and, despite his longstanding opposition to such provisions, will choose one to add to his bill That is a tacit admission Democrats do not believe they could override a threatened veto. The provision would require certification of training and have a life span considerably shorter than the six months espoused by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal requires no skills training; Republicans argue that would discourage hiring in low-skills, entry-level jobs. Democrats argue that those paid the minimum wage _ frozen at $ 3.35 for eight years _ have seen their buying power erode by nearly 40 percent and that even an increase to $ 4.65 will lag behind inflation. Republicans counter by saying that raising the minimum wage will result in dramatic job losses, cost the federal government millions if not billions and fail to help the working poor. Democrats have played down the employment implications of their bill, which the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration says would cost 650,000 jobs. A <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> analysis released Friday put the number at 125,000 to 250,000. Backers of <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> bill also have dismissed talk about the potential budget cost, but Republicans last week asserted that <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>' bill would result in the loss of more than 430,000 jobs in four popular government programs alone unless another $ 570 million is spent on them. The programs are College Work Study, <ORGANIZATION> Head </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Start </ORGANIZATION>, Community Service Employers for Older Americans and the federal summer jobs program for youths. `` The Democrats are trying to represent the minimum wage as having no cost to the government,'' <PERSON> Armey </PERSON> said. `` My point is if you believe in these programs, do you want to cut thousands of people from them?'' <PERSON> Armey </PERSON> failed in an attempt to amend the legislation to exempt those programs from having to pay any increase in the minimum wage. Another bill due for floor debate this week would expand the rights of federal employees who blow the whistle on fraud. The measure sailed through the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> supports it. Similar legislation was the subject of a controversial <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> veto. The week also should bring changes to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> leadership and include debate that ultimately could reshape the Democratic leadership as well. <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> lawmakers are expected to choose Wednesday between two candidates vying to replace <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> in the No. 2 leadership post, pragmatist <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Madigan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and flamboyant conservative <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. The balloting in that race will come as the chamber's ethics committee deliberates whether Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> violated <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules through his financial dealings, which have been the subject of a nine-month panel investigation. Budget negotiations also are expected to continue this week and the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> banking subcommittee will hold a final hearing on the savings and loan crisis before writing a $ 100 billion bailout plan likely to be drawn heavily from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s recent proposal.

 Now that <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> has completed its third straight successful post-Challenger shuttle flight, <ORGANIZATION> Atlantis </ORGANIZATION> will be rolled to the launch pad Wednesday for a mission that will include a planetary probe. Packed in Atlantis' cargo bay for the scheduled April 28 liftoff will be the <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Venus </ORGANIZATION> spacecraft, the first planetary probe to be carried by a space shuttle and <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s first planned planet flight since 1978. <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> is to be released from the cargo bay. After 466 days, it is to orbit <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> and map its cloud-shrouded surface with high resolution radar. Discovery's return to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> on Saturday following a successful five-day mission buoyed the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s ambitious plan to launch seven shuttles this year as it continues its recovery from the 1986 Challenger explosion and builds toward a launch rate of 12 a year by 1992. `` Our goal is to fly again and again,'' with safety always a prime consideration, said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Truly </PERSON>, shuttle program director. He said Discovery returned in better condition than any other shuttle and that bodes well for maintaining a vigorous launch schedule. Truly said one stumbling block may be the extensive modifications being made to <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, the oldest shuttle. That shuttle's July 1 target launch date with a classified military payload already has slipped about two weeks. Any additional holdup could push back another military shuttle flight planned in August, and that could begin affecting the high priority October launch of Atlantis with the <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> probe to <LOCATION> Jupiter </LOCATION>. `` We want very much to launch <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> in July,'' Truly said. `` If not, we'll delay it to meet the Galileo window.'' `` This is the third successful flight of the space shuttle since we have returned to flight,'' Truly said after Discovery landed Saturday. `` It shows again what a marvelous and capable vehicle this is.'' It also demonstrates, he said, that <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> has the capability of flying a busy and safe launch rate. <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> are high-priority missions because there is only a month or so every two years when their planetary targets are in the proper alignment for a launch. Here's the launch schedule for the remainder of the year: April 28 _ Atlantis, with the Magellan-Venus spacecraft. Mid-July _ <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>, with a <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> payload. Mid-August _ Discovery with a <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> payload. Oct. 12 _ Atlantis, with the Galileo-Jupiter spacecraft. Nov. 13 _ <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>, whose crew is to deploy a communications satellite and retrieve for return to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> a scientific satellite orbiting since 1984. Dec. 11 _ Discovery, with the Hubble Space Telescope. Ten flights are scheduled in 1990.

<HEAD>1990s Look Good for US Farm Exports</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Do n't look for the super-heated exports of the 1970s to return soon, but an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> economist says rising global demand for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agricultural products could bring at least a miniboom in the 1990s. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Trostle </PERSON> of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> says the growing demand is n't expected to match the fast pace of the 1970s when the volume of farm exports rose an average of 9 percent a year. The world's economic growth rate in the 1990s simply is not expected to support that kind of growth. But incomes in other countries are likely to rise faster in the next decade than they have in the 1980s, <PERSON> Trostle </PERSON> said. And higher incomes should translate into greater demand for agricultural products. `` The best markets for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will be the developing countries,'' <PERSON> Trostle </PERSON> said in an article prepared for the April issue of Farmline magazine. `` More of the world's population will seek higher quality diets,'' he said. `` We will see a continuing gradual change toward higher valued and processed products, such as meats, fruits and vegetables, and dairy products.'' People with rising incomes will want more protein, and that will generate a growing demand for livestock feed, such as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn, so the countries can produce more meat, <PERSON> Trostle </PERSON> said. Foreign use of feed grains is expected to climb faster than food grains, which include wheat and rice. <PERSON> Trostle </PERSON> and his agency colleagues say they ca n't make a flat prediction about the'90s being the start of a golden era because `` the future demand for American farm products could be either stifled or stimulated'' by any number of factors: _ Last year's crop-depleting drought in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> could trigger larger production by some export competitors wanting to cash in on the higher commodity prices _ Developing countries could let domestic food prices rise, thus encouraging farmers to produce more food for their own people In general, that would tend to boost import demand by raising incomes _ and when incomes rise, demand usually outruns a country's ability to produce. _ The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s import needs, particularly for soybean meal and other high-protein feeds, are unknown at this time _ The outcome of current negotiations under <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION>, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and the future of trade barriers and export subsidies <PERSON> Trostle </PERSON> said the years 1981-88, when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> shipments abroad tumbled, showed that exports are critical to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> agriculture, and when they suffer, so do farmers. `` The production from about one of every three acres harvested in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is marketed to consumers in other countries,'' <PERSON> Trostle </PERSON> said. `` In recent years, the value of total <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agricultural exports averaged more than $ 16,000 a farm.'' <PERSON> Trostle </PERSON> said foreign demand for agricultural products will probably grow more slowly in the 1990s than it did in the 1970s _ but faster than it did in the first half of the 1980s. He cited several forces that help shape this outlook: _ World population growth has slowed from a peak of 2 percent annually in the 1960s to about 1.7 percent now, and the trend is expected to continue Even so, the slower growth will add about 80 million more mouths to feed each year. _ Many countries will have slower income growth than in the 1970s, but the increases in the'80s are projected to be faster than in the early 1980s, particularly in the developing countries _ Surpluses will continue to be more common than shortages in world markets, so most commodities will be priced competitively, often with favorable credit terms _ Debt problems will continue to hold back both income and import demand in debtor countries, but to a lesser degree over time as debt is gradually retired, restructured, forgiven or otherwise resolved

 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is trying to move the issues of affordable housing and homelessness to the forefront of the national agenda, after eight years of cutbacks under the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. More than a quarter of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> last week co-sponsored a bill that seeks to address the housing concerns of everyone from first-time home buyers to the homeless. The bill, called the National Affordable Housing Act, seeks `` to set the framework for a new national housing strategy'' said Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif., chairman of the Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs subcommittee on housing `` It is imperative that we reverse a decade of neglect in housing. ... I sense a growing impatience to raise housing back to the place it deserves in the nation's priorities,'' said <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, the bill's primary sponsor. The act would require states and local governments to submit five-year housing plans to the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> and update the plans annually. It also would create a single institution within <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> with the authority to provide direct assistance to government agencies. It would establish an assistant housing secretary post to administer programs for the elderly, handicapped and homeless. For individuals the bill would seek to reduce the size of down payments and allow first-time home buyers to use funds from individual retirement accounts or 401K retirement plans for the investment, reduce <ORGANIZATION> FHA </ORGANIZATION> mortgage rates while increasing the ceiling of loan amounts in many cases and set limits on the percentage of income paid by tenants receiving rental assistance. Low-income tax credits for developers set to expire next year would be made permanent through provisions set forth in an earlier bill co-sponsored by <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> and Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON>, R-Mo. There have been `` no specific commitments'' from the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration but housing secretary <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> likes many of the bill's elements is `` very interested in the measure,'' according to <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, who has met with <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> several times. `` We're going to enact housing legislation this session,'' declared <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>. The subcommittee will begin hearings on the proposal next month. As the <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> bill came out of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Subcommittee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, held the second in a series of all-day hearings on the need for permanent housing for the homeless. Earlier in the month, Sen. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, D-Tenn., challenged <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` to show the leadership this issue demands'' and called for a White House conference on homelessness In addition, Sen. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Mikulski </PERSON>, D-Md., is set to challenge the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration if it intends to replace rental assistance certificates with vouchers as proposed in former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Mikulski </PERSON> has released a study by the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, the research arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, which `` presents compelling evidence that the administration's housing voucher program will cost as much as $ 9.6 billion more over the next 12 years than the rental assistance certificate program it was designed to replace.'' And Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON>, D-Calif., said <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> has agreed to appear before the Government Operations subcommittee on employment and housing which <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> chairs <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s appearance would follow his expected selection as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Interagency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> for the Homeless. The council, the government's chief coordinating agency for homelessness programs, was roundly criticized by lawmakers last week as a do-nothing panel under <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Baker Nearing Decision on Envoy to Afghan Rebels</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> appears close to making a decision on sending a special ambassador to the U.S.-backed rebels fighting the Soviet-supported regime in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, administration officials say. The move is aimed at broadening <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> influence among the long-feuding Moslem rebel factions, the officials said over the weekend. A White House official said the envoy's role could be seen as attempting to limit <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s influence among the Afghan guerrillas, in particular its backing of radical Moslem fundamentalist rebels over more moderate factions. He said <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> has the matter `` under consideration'' and that he `` may be close to a decision point.'' The official, who spoke on condition his name not be used, said the proposal `` is still on <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s desk'' and has not yet reached President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. A <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official, who also spoke privately, said the proposal has been `` under consideration for a long time,'' but said he was uncertain of the timing of the decision or its possible announcement. The first official emphasized that the move would not imply <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> recognition of any interim government established by the rebels, also known as mujahedeen, or Islamic holy warriors. Civil war has ravaged <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> for more than 11 years and divisions among the rebel units could prolong the fighting. The seven main guerrilla groups are members of an alliance based in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, but have been deeply divided as their leaders struggle for power and attempt to form a transitional regime leading to a postwar Islamic republic of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Throughout the war, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has funneled aid to the rebels through <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. That nation has directed the lion's share of support to one of the most successful rebel groups, the radical fundamentalist unit headed by <PERSON> Gulbuddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON>. He not only has sought domination over the other groups, but also advocates restructuring Afghan society along strict fundamentalist Islamic lines. The Soviets, who entered <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in 1979, withdrew in February under an agreement mediated by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. Last week the Soviets renewed arms shipments to the communist regime in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, saying they will continue to supply equipment to President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s troops as long as <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> supply the guerrillas. Last year, Sen. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, pushed a law through <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that required the appointment of a special ambassador. On Friday, senators renewed the call for the appointment in a resolution. The resolution, which was referred to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, also said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should not cut the amount of military equipment it gives the Afghan guerrillas until it is `` absolutely clear'' that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has ended assistance to its proxies. Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, authored the resolution, which was signed by <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, and Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan.,

 The right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> claimed victory in the presidential vote Sunday, a day of fierce clashes between leftist rebels and troops that left at least 29 people dead. Three journalists were among those killed. The alliance, known as Arena, said its candidate gained more than 50 percent of the vote _ enough to avoid a runoff election next month against the incumbent <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>. `` We are sure and we proclaim ourselves the victors,'' <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Aubuisson </PERSON>, founder of <PERSON> Arena </PERSON>, told a news conference. Arena presidential candidate <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> said the party had results from 75 percent of the polling places and he was assured of victory. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, which surveyed 21 polling places in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> that it considered would predict results for the entire city, found <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> getting 60.5 percent, the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> 31.7 percent, and the leftist Democratic Convergence 5.7 percent. `` Is it now quite possible that <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> is headed for a first-round victory,'' the embassy said in a cable addressed to Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> that was obtained by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. The document, which cited no raw vote figures, predicted turnout would be 58 percent. Election authorities said preliminary official results were expected Monday. A rebel boycott and scattered firefights between guerrillas and troops trimmed the voter turnout. Six soldiers and 23 guerrillas were killed in battles as the rebels tried to disrupt the voting, according to Col. <PERSON> Emilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON>, chief of the joint chiefs of staff. Two Salvadoran journalists and a Dutch television cameraman also were killed _ one during clash at a rebel-held town and the others at military checkpoints. <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidate <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mena </PERSON> had said he expected to do better in the countryside than in the capital, but his party's headquarters was virtually deserted Sunday night and the party provided no results. `` We have the 50 percent that is needed to win and I can assure you there will be no second round,'' said <PERSON> D'Aubuisson </PERSON>. `` I am proud to have been able to carry such a good and capable man as <PERSON> Freddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> to the presidency.'' Critics claim <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> is still controlled by <PERSON> D'Aubuisson </PERSON>, a former army major who has been accused of having links with rightist death squads. <PERSON> D'Aubuisson </PERSON> has repeatedly denied the allegations. There was no official word on turnout, but a spot check of several polling places in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> showed about 60 percent of registered voters cast ballots. <PERSON> Ana </PERSON> <PERSON> Guadalupe </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, a rebel spokeswoman in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, said enough people had stayed away from the polls to prove that no election could be held without participation by the rebel <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. She said no polling places or voters had been attacked, as the guerrillas had pledged, but rebel assaults on government installations prevented the army from taking voters to the polls. The guerrillas had imposed a transport ban and sabotaged telephone lines and electricity, which cut or restricted power to 80 percent of the country. Roman Catholic churches were crowded with Palm Sunday worshipers and by midday there were long lines of voters at polling stations in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. Turnout was light in many smaller towns. `` With these problems it's better to stay home,'' said <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortiz </PERSON>, 23. He spoke in front of his home in the capital as guerrillas retreated from an assault on a military post three blocks away. Sporadic rifle fire echoed from the slope of the Guazapa volcano, a guerrilla stronghold north of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, as troops fought insurgents in the 9-year-old war that has claimed an estimated 70,000 lives. There were seven presidential candidates and the three major ones were <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>, <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mena </PERSON> and <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ungo </PERSON> of the Democratic Convergence. Christian Democrat President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s five-year term ends June 1. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>, barred by law from running for re-election, is dying of liver cancer. <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> has vowed to follow free-market policies and reduce state intervention in the economy. His party promised to step up the war if the guerrillas do not agree to lay down their arms. <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mena </PERSON>, a lawyer, heads the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>' conservative wing He struggled against opposition charges of corruption in the U.S.-backed government and inability of his party to deal with the economy and the civil war. Leaders of the Democratic Convergence maintain formal links with the guerrillas. This is the first election since 1977 in which socialist candidates have competed. About 1.83 million people out of a population of 5 million were eligible to vote and polls were open in 243 of the country's 262 municipalities. Nineteen towns in the north did not set up voting stations because election officials deemed those rebel-held zones too dangerous. In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sebastian </LOCATION>, 30 miles east of the capital, turnout was light. `` The people are frightened,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Doherty </PERSON> of the American <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>. `` There is no question that the intimidation by the -LRB- guerrillas -RRB- is working.'' <PERSON> Doherty </PERSON> is one of 21 congressmen, state politicians and private citizens named by the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to be official election observers. He said turnout was `` far less'' than during three previous elections he attended this decade. <PERSON> Cornel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lagrouw </PERSON>, a cameraman for Dutch national television, was killed as army troops moved to oust guerrillas occupying the eastern town of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <PERSON> Javier </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Gentile </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> photographer for <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Lagrouw </PERSON> was part of a group of six journalists and two drivers who were in the town. The others dragged him away and fled in two cars, but they came under repeated helicopter fire despite press markings and white flags on the vehicles, <PERSON> Gentile </PERSON> said. Two Salvadoran journalists were killed and another seriously wounded when security forces fired on their vehicles. The armed forces said the vehicles failed to heed orders to stop at roadblocks. In the March 1988 elections for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> won 32 seats, the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> 23 and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conciliation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> six. But a group called the <ORGANIZATION> Authentic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> split from the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, taking 16 seats from <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s faction. The next legislative elections are set for March 1991.

 They're at it again _ those bickering states who share the <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and a hearty animosity. They've battled over Westway, the Statue of Liberty and the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Giants </ORGANIZATION>. The latest provocation in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York-New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> border war: a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> tax law, passed in 1987 and discovered just recently, which will tax Jerseyans' <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> income at a rate based on their total income. Translation: If you make $ 25,000 a year in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, and your spouse makes $ 75,000 annually west of the <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION>, you're taxed on the $ 25,000 as if you're in the $ 100,000 bracket. Adding insult to usury -LRB- or so say the Jerseyans -RRB-, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> invited irate New Jerseyans to sue and suggested any commuter who did n't like the law could quit `` and leave those jobs for New Yorkers.'' After pulling his foot from his mouth, <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> called <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> and apologized. But it was too late to stop angry residents of the Garden State from some nasty Cuomo-bashing. `` His arrogance has infuriated <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerseyans </LOCATION>,'' said <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> Republican <PERSON> Assemblyman </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardwick </PERSON>, who has filed suit on behalf of his state. `` He's supposed to be the compassionate governor? He's made it clear his compassion ends at the <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>.'' Agreed <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Golden </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kean </PERSON>'s press secretary: `` To people on this side o the <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> _ commuters, legislators, whoever _ this is seen as another attempt to step on the people of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>.'' The level of bile gets even higher among those who will be actually hit by the tax. `` Can you believe this guy? We do n't get education, do n't get welfare. What do we get for our tax dollars?'' asked commuter <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Middletown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> `` We get sewer service _ and that winds up on the <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> shore anyway!'' <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> heads up the Taxpayers' Revolt, an ad hoc committee that has encouraged <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> commuters to stop spending money in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> until the law is rescinded. `` They did a real <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> job on us. They passed this in'87 to take effect in'88 and told us about it in'89,'' said <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON>. But this dispute is just the latest round in a seemingly endless struggle between the two neighbors. <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> commuters affected by the tax are n't screaming for <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>'s head _ but then, they've been able to stand by and enjoy these NY-NJ spats: _ <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>'s courting of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> businesses and the city's subsequent battle to keep the A highlight of this continuing competition: a newspaper ad depicting Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, hammer in hand, boarding up the <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tunnel </LOCATION> to prevent defections. _ The moves to the <LOCATION> Meadowlands </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rutherford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, by the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Giants </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- from Yankee Stadium -RRB- and the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jets </LOCATION> -LRB- from <LOCATION> Shea </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stadium </LOCATION> -RRB- A split decision in this fight: <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> got the teams, but both still use <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in their names. _ Both sides claimed the Statue of Liberty, which stands in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> between the states The courts finally ruled in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s favor. Another slap at the Garden State: the statue stands with its back to <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. _ <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> complains <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> factories are poisoning its air; <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> claims <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> landfill _ known as `` <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Koch </LOCATION>'' in the Garden State _ is polluting waterways _ A delegation of <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> congressmen helped sink Westway, the $ 2 billion highway development planned for <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION> One of the controversial project's biggest boosters: Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>. After that defeat, the governor pointed directly at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and affixed the blame: `` The people from <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> did it in response to a war with <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>.'' Obviously, that war continues. But <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> does n't have only bad things to say about <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>; just last month, he told an interviewer, `` I love <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. My father's first job was as a ditch digger in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>.'' Which, of course, would have made the elder <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> eligible to join <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> in the Taxpayers' Revolt.

<HEAD>Thousands Rally To Support Maverick Reformer's Election Bid</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Hundreds of people rallied in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to vent anger at the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> elite's alleged campaign to discredit ousted city party boss <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, a maverick reformer who is running for national office. In a rare display of political passion, about 3,000 people marched on city hall Sunday to drum up support for the popular candidate. Police made no move to break up the unauthorized gathering. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> is seeking a seat in the new national parliament, the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, in elections next Sunday that will represent the country's first experiment with contested elections. `` He's against the party mafia, and that's why the party mafia is against him,'' declared marcher <PERSON> Taras </PERSON> <PERSON> Osipov </PERSON>, a 65-year-old retired engineer. `` <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> is with the people, and for the people.'' <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, 58, is running to represent the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> capital, where he headed the local party apparatus for almost two years before President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> fired him for criticizing the slow pace of reform. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> has charged that the party machine is conspiring to derail his candidacy and restricting voters' access to his campaign. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>'s opponent in the election is <PERSON> Yevgeny </PERSON> <PERSON> Brakov </PERSON>, director of the Zil automobile factory. As the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> lurches toward Sunday's vote, it is clear that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms have brought amazing latitude in public debate to a country that only recently punished unorthodox ideas with harsh prison terms. Pravda reported on Sunday that even <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and other members of the party's ruling Politburo failed to win unanimous support in their bids for seats on the new legislature. Providing unusual insight into divisions in the policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper said that of 641 <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> members and alternates who voted Thursday, 12 opposed <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s candidacy. <PERSON> Yegor </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>, reputedly a conservative force on the Politburo, recieved the most `` no'' votes of any Politburo member _ 78, Pravda said. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and some other organizations are entitled to directly choose 750 of the 2,250 members of the legislature. The other 1,500 will be chosen March 26 in nationwide elections. Although party members proposed 31,000 candidates for its 100 seats in the legislature, the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> chose to nominate all 100 people suggested by the Politburo, then elected all their nominees. The <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> vote showed there is considerable opposition not only to <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>, but also to Politburo members closely linked to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. Prior to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, such votes were customarily unanimous. Thousands of <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> supporters had planned to rally Sunday at <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s Gorky Park. When they were told permission for the meeting had been refused, they set off for the city center. Their anger was kindled by a <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> decision last week to form a special commission to investigate charges that <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, who is still a <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> member, opposes some party policies. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> won support from many Muscovites with a campaign against corruption and spirited attacks on the privileges available to the government and party elite. At one point during the march, scores of police officers barred the crowd from getting near the Kremlin, the seat of Soviet power. Police and <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> agents along the route directed the marchers but made no attempt to halt them, even though their protest violated city regulations that require seven days' notice of any demonstration. The street resounded with the chant of `` Hands off <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>!'' as the marchers approached city hall. There, a cordon of police barred their way. In unison, the protesters shook their fists and chanted their demand to meet with <PERSON> Lev </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaikov </PERSON>, a Politburo member and the current <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party boss. <PERSON> Zaikov </PERSON> leads the party machine <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> claims is working for his defeat. One pro-Yeltsin speaker near the building's doorway shouted, `` Shame on our Soviet democracy. Shame on our leaders.'' When the elderly man called for a one-day strike across <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> if <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> is defeated, the crowd roared and raised its hands in approval. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Oct. 21, 1987, that faith in <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms was waning and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was becoming the subject of `` intolerable'' glorification. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, who had been named <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party boss in December 1985 and a non-voting member of the Politburo two months later, lost both posts as a result of his remarks. He was later named to a ministerial-rank job in the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Construction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>.

 Americans widely expect the federal government to fail in its search for a lasting solution to the savings and loan crisis, a national survey by <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> has found. The poll of 1,108 adults also revealed a considerable lack of confidence in the beleaguered S & amp; L industry: Only half the respondents called thrifts safe and a third of those with <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L deposits feared losing their money. Half those surveyed favored greater government regulation of the industry, and a majority preferred bailing out failing thrifts to closing them. But most opposed having the public bear the brunt of the costs. Federal insurance is insufficient to cover accounts at the estimated 350 savings and loans that are failing, and the government so far has taken over 166 of them while <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> devise a rescue plan. The nation has 2,955 savings and loan associations in all. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has proposed using $ 50 billion in government-backed bonds to help cover the accounts, in addition to $ 40 billion pledged last year to sell or prop up failed thrifts. But in the poll just 27 percent said the government should pay most of the costs of salvaging the industry. Instead, a 42 percent plurality said the S & amp; L industry should bear most of the costs by paying higher insurance premiums on its accounts, a lesser feature of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan. Just 14 percent supported a fee on S & amp; L depositors, an idea the administration considered and dropped. Whatever the eventual plan, only 31 percent believed the government will find a long-term solution to the crisis. Thirty-nine percent expected `` only a temporary solution'' and 19 percent predicted no solution. The rest expressed no opinion. The survey did find support for the government program of giving <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls financial assistance to attract buyers. Of those who had an opinion, 51 percent favored such bailouts while 29 percent preferred closing down failing thrifts and paying off their depositors. Of the 35 percent of respondents who had S & amp; L accounts, only 9 percent said they were withdrawing money because of the industry's problems But a fifth said they were considering that step and as many said they were holding off on new deposits. S & amp; Ls have sustained record withdrawals lately, but federal analysts have chiefly blamed the higher interest rates that are available elsewhere rather than concern about the industry's financial problems But while the poll found that the S & amp; L crisis had not yet prompted many depositors to reduce their accounts, others said they were staying away. Of those who have not had money in S & amp; Ls during the past year, 18 percent said they were keeping their money out because of the thrifts' woes. The industry problems were widely recognized: Only 53 percent overall regarded S & amp; Ls as a safe place to keep their money, compared with 93 percent who saw banks as safe. Thirty-six percent called S & amp; Ls unsafe and 11 percent were n't sure. A 48 percent plurality blamed the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L crisis on bad management by the thrifts; among other respondents with an opinion, 21 percent blamed general economic problems and 11 percent blamed fraud by <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L managers. Only 10 percent blamed a lack of government regulation. But 53 percent nonetheless favored bolstering goverment regulation, twice the number who said current regulation was `` about right.'' The survey, conducted March 6-15, found relatively little variation in opinion across the demographic spectrum. In the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, where thrifts have fared worst, 49 percent rated them safe; in the Northeast, 56 percent called them safe. That gap slightly exceeded the margin of error plus or minus 3 percentage points. The poll was conducted by the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a communications company based in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, that publishes the Richmond Times-Dispatch, the Richmond News Leader, the <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> -RRB- Journal, and operates TV stations <ORGANIZATION> WXFL </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, WCBD in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> WJKS </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>.

A preliminary examination indicated only 10 thermal protection tiles will need to be replaced, in contrast to the last shuttle flight, in December, when nearly 200 tiles were severely damaged. `` This is one of the best yet,'' said <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lodge </PERSON>, who works on the shuttle's tile system. `` We've had no major damages, there's a few dings ... around the nose cap, nothing severe at all.'' The tiles shield orbiters during the fiery re-entry into Earth's atmosphere Five tiles were damaged when wires connected to a tire pressure monitor snapped as the right main landing gear dropped, Ms. <PERSON> Lodge </PERSON> said. Only one of those five tiles will need to be replaced, she said. The brakes, which have caused problems during previous shuttle landings, also performed well, engineers said. `` The brakes looked the best ever. No signs of any heat; there was no damage whatsoever,'' said <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s Tip Talone, who coordinates processing of the orbiter for each flight. The mission ended with a picture-perfect landing that was watched by a near-record crowd of 460,000. Five hundred people cheered the astronauts' return to <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> later in the afternoon. `` We've had one fun time and we really enjoyed this flight,'' said mission specialist <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchli </PERSON>, who had been on two previous Discovery missions. The flight was commanded by <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Coats </PERSON>, who had flown one previous shuttle mission. The other crew members _ pilot <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blaha </PERSON> and mission specialists <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Springer </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bagian </PERSON> _ made their first voyages. Discovery's flight, the 28th shuttle mission, was the third since Challenger exploded shortly after liftoff on Jan. 28, 1986. Seven astronauts died in the explosion, which brought shuttle flights to a halt for nearly three years. Discovery blasted off from <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, a week ago today. Six hours into the mission, the crew accomplished its primary mission _ the deployment of a $ 100 million communications satellite. The satellite completes a network that will enable the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> to have nearly constant contact with space shuttles and other satellites. The astronauts also photographed the Earth. Their film will be edited into a movie that will document environmental damage by man and nature. Four rats that were aboard as one of the experiments, were killed shortly after touchdown so researchers can study how their intentionally cut legs healed in microgravity. Many of the 32 fertilized chicken eggs that were aboard will be allowed to hatch to see how space affected embryo development. Other experiments included growing protein crystals as part of a project to develop new drugs and seeing how plants grow in microgravity. The results will be studied by the researchers who designed the experiments. The only problem during the flight concerned an erratic pressure reading from a hydrogen tank that helps supply electricity to the orbiter. The astronauts conserved electricity for a day until ground controllers corrected the difficulty. The next shuttle to fly _ <LOCATION> Atlantis </LOCATION> _ is expected to be rolled out to a <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION> launch pad Wednesday for its scheduled April 28 liftoff. The Atlantis astronauts will deploy a probe that will map the surface of <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 The devastating drought of 1988 is still fresh on farmers' minds, and insurers say they're getting a bumper crop of business this year _ a lot earlier than usual. More than 100 million acres of farm land are expected to be insured this year, compared with about 75 million acres in 1988, says <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Gantz </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurers </ORGANIZATION>. `` It is a gigantic record,'' he said, adding that up to 150 million acres could be covered if conditions remain dry through the April 15 deadline for signing up for federally subsidized multi-peril crop insurance. Rainfall has been in short supply so far this year, scaring many farmers who watched their fields and pocketbooks shrivel during last year's long, hot and dry summer across the Farm Belt. The drought resulted in a $ 3.9 billion federal bailout. `` When the house burns down down the street, most people get out their homeowners policy to check and see if they're covered,'' <PERSON> Gantz </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, office of the trade group. `` And if you do n't have a policy, you get one.'' <PERSON> Gantz </PERSON> said some insurers already are reporting two to three times their normal farm business. Joy Tegels, general manager of <ORGANIZATION> Agri-Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consultants </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> in the central <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> community of <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, said crop insurance business already is up 25 percent. She said that in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, where 44 percent of the crop land was covered by federal crop insurance last year, an estimated 60 percent of crops would be covered this year if there's no substantial rainfall soon. `` We have not -LRB- yet -RRB- seen the deluge we're going to see if the weather pattern stays the same,'' she said. `` Our office will be like <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, you'll have to take a number'' to be served. The selling point this year, said <PERSON> Tegels </PERSON>, is that people collected on federal crop insurance policies. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> reported paying claims of nearly $ 1.2 billion on $ 435 million in premiums collected last year, said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Forgash </PERSON>, a spokesman in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for the government-supported program. The program insures against drought losses and protects against insect infestation, plant disease, and damage from hail, winds and flooding. The biggest payout to any state went to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, where $ 550 in claims were paid for every $ 100 in premiums collected, covering a total of $ 187.1 million in damages. <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> ranked second, with $ 127.7 million, or $ 320 in claims for every $ 100 in premiums collected. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has warned that it wo n't be so willing to stage a rescue this year for those who failed to insure themselves against losses last year. `` I would n't count on it in 1989,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Tauke </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Iowa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Tauke </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was able to help drought-plagued farmers last year because there were `` a couple of billion dollars to play with'' after a miscalculation of the cost of the farm program, `` and it was an election year.'' Fueling the pressure to buy coverage was a requirement that those who received federal emergency assistance last year be insured this year. Bankers, too, are demanding borrowers to carry drought policies as collateral on crop loans. Federal crop insurance plans allow farmers to choose coverage that will pay the equivalent of 50 percent, 65 percent or 75 percent of the 10-year average yields on production. <PERSON> Forgash </PERSON> said premium rates wo n't change this year as a result of last year's heavy claims. He said the system is not geared to reacting quickly to such payouts. `` It would be patently unfair to recover an entire catastrophic loss in one insurance year,'' he said. The rush to insure apparently has not been affected by allegations last year that an insurance company had reneged on drought-insurance policies. The <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> wound up agreeing to pay $ 48 million to settle a class-action lawsuit on behalf of about 8,000 farmers in 10 states.

<HEAD>Dream Fuels Native Runner's Quest For Sacred Object</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Cree Indian driven by a vision has led a 2,700-mile run to meet with museum officials and request that a cloth-wrapped bundle sacred to the tribe be returned to his people in western <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. `` We've been running every mile of the way. ... It's Indian custom to send foot messengers,'' <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Thunder </PERSON>, 38, said Friday as he and two companions neared the American Museum of Natural History. At stake is a bundle assembled by Chief Big Bear more than 150 years ago to give his people spiritual guidance and protection. Complicating the quest is a competing claim for the relic and museum's reluctance to part with it. `` In 1979, I had a dream in which Chief Big Bear appeared to me and offered a ceremonial pipe with the request that I bring the bundle home from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Thunder </PERSON> said. `` I made a vow that I would do it.'' The calico-wrapped bundle _ about the size of two opened hands and containing a bear claw, a clump of sweet grass and a plug of tobacco _ was acquired by the museum in 1934 when a son of Big Bear gave it to an anthropologist for safe keeping, said museum spokesman <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Kurz </PERSON>. The bundle, never put on display, has remained in storage as part of a collection studied by scholars, <PERSON> Kurz </PERSON> said. It's also made available to Indians who occasionally want to see it. Thunder, saying the sacred object is `` homesick,'' maintains it should be returned to the Native Americans who would use it in their religious ceremonies. <PERSON> Kurz </PERSON> said staff anthropologists would meet with Thunder on Wednesday, but the spokesman held out little hope the museum would surrender the bundle. `` This object was given to the museum by a son of the Chief Big Bear. He asked the museum to keep it,'' <PERSON> Kurz </PERSON> said. `` The museum does n't usually give away objects that were acquired legitimately.'' Thunder views himself as Big Bear's great-great grandson but admits he's not a blood relative. `` In 1985 I was adopted by an old Indian woman who was a great granddaughter of Big Bear,'' he said. Indians who oppose Thunder have asked the museum not to give him the bundle. `` We want it. We're the descendants of this great man,'' <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Standing </PERSON> <PERSON> Rock </PERSON>, 36, said in a telephone interview from his home on the Rocky Boy Indian reservation in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>. `` He is my great-great grandfather.'' `` We do n't even know <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Thunder </PERSON>,'' he said. Standing Rock said his family and other Indians in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> have asked the museum to reject Thunder's claims and give the object to them instead. But <PERSON> Thunder </PERSON> said: `` I'm not doing this because I'm a descendant of Chief Big Bear. I'm doing it because Big Bear requested of me to bring this bundle home. This is not something I chose for myself.'' Big Bear, who created the bundle when he was 13, wore it into battle in 1885, when the <PERSON> Cree </PERSON> joined Canadian rebel <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Riel </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Metis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> of central <LOCATION> Saskatchewan </LOCATION> to fight white settlers. Legend has it that the bundle helped Big Bear and his people escape after the revolt failed. In the more than 50 years the museum has had the bundle, no one made any attempt to return it to the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> people before Thunder began his run from <LOCATION> Edmonton </LOCATION> on Sept. 1. Thunder, a two-pack a day cigarette smoker, and companions <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON> <PERSON> Cote </PERSON> and <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Basil </PERSON>, set out with a pace car, some money and words of discouragement from critics who said they had little chance of success. `` We were a determined little bunch. We left on faith and $ 135,'' <PERSON> Thunder </PERSON> said. Throughout, they depended on people they met for money, food and shelter. At the Mohawk reservation near <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>, Indian leaders raised nearly $ 5,000 for the effort, he said. They occasionally had to wait out blizzards, but on the days they could travel they averaged 20 miles a day, taking turns running across southern <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> in a series of relays. If the object is surrendered by the museum, a council of three chiefs, three elders and descendants of Big Bear will meet to decide who will be named the keeper of the bundle, <PERSON> Thunder </PERSON> said. `` To us, it's not just a historical artifact. It has a lot of ceremonial value, what you call spiritual significance,'' <PERSON> Thunder </PERSON> said. And, if the museum refuses? `` We're going to honor that,'' <PERSON> Thunder </PERSON> said. `` We're not here to have a protest rally, go on a hunger strike or do anything drastic. It's just a simple request and all we want is an answer.''

<HEAD>Roh Cancels Referendum On His Performance</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo announced today that he is postponing a national referendum on his performance _ a campaign promise _ and claimed leftist forces are trying to overthrow the government. In a nationally televised address, <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> said the nation faces a major threat from radical groups and that going ahead with the referendum now would risk plunging <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> into new chaos. `` Violent leftist forces are trying to overthrow the government,'' he said. The former general said the referendum would be held sometime in the future, but gave no indication of when or how. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> had been expected to announce this week that the referendum would be held about April 12. It was not clear if <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> was backing away from the referendum because of concern about potential unrest or because he feared the government could not win the vote and might be forced into new elections. Some government officials had expressed concern about <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s ability to win a referendum. The government had said earlier that <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> would not resign if he was defeated, but some administration officials conceded a defeat would put pressure on <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> to call elections. Critics said <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> could not win a referendum. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> said on television that `` it would not be of help to the country to hold a national referendum for my performance in office at this juncture.'' The main opposition parties said they accepted <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s decision, but would watch to ensure the government does not attempt to retreat on any other promises to bring in full democracy. `` We feel sorry for the people to have such a president who has unilaterally postponed the referendum without presenting a concrete alternative,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> Reunification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, one of the two main opposition groups. Dissidents groups denounced <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s decision, saying it proved the government never intended to hold a referendum and proved that the administration knew it could not win a popular vote. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's main dissident alliance, said it would proceed with plans to campaign for <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s ouster. `` <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s postponement of the referendum is an act deceiving the people,'' the alliance said. Several hundred radical students shouting `` Punish <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo'' attacked two police stations with firebombs today in the southern city of <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> news agency <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION> reported. No arrests or injuries were reported. Radicals have organized a series of violent anti-government protests, but they lack broad public support. `` Leftist forces are trying to use the mid-term appraisal as a foothold for overthrowing the free democratic system,'' <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> has introduced broad democratic reforms since winning office in late 1987, but many South Koreans distrust the government because of its ties to the authoritarian regime of former President <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON>. The Party of Peace and Democracy of <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON> welcomed the referendum delay. The Reunification Democratic Party of <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Young-sam </PERSON> said it would accept only a temporary delay. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Young-sam </PERSON> had been pushing for a referendum after predicting <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> would lose. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON> opposed a referendum, apparently because <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Young-sam </PERSON>'s party had overtaken his party in opinion polls and could win presidential elections. The Kims are bitter rivals who split the opposition vote in the December 1987 elections, allowing <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> to win with 36 percent of the vote. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> promised during the election campaign to hold a referendum after his first year in office to give voters a chance to evaluate his performance.

<HEAD>FBI Says Mafia Families Argued Over Proposed Film About Crime Figure</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A film proposal to depict the story of the late mob leader <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> <PERSON> Lansky </PERSON> reportedly triggered a struggle between two powerful Mafia families, according to federal court documents. Recently unsealed <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> affidavits revealed evidence that <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Genovese crime family wanted to win the lead role for actor <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Caan </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported Sunday. A prominent Hollywood executive backing a different script about <PERSON> Lansky </PERSON> turned for help to the rival Gambino crime family, according to the affidavits. The present status of the rival concepts were n't reported. The involvement of the Genovese and Gambino crime families demonstrated the fascination mobsters have with their image, as well as with potential profits from box-office successes, the Times said. The bickering over the <PERSON> Lansky </PERSON> film began in 1987 when `` The Untouchables,'' a film about <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Agent <PERSON> Elliot </PERSON> <PERSON> Ness </PERSON>' campaign against <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Capone </PERSON>, already had grossed nearly $ 75 million, the newspaper said. <PERSON> Lansky </PERSON> died in 1983 at age 81 as what investigators called the undisputed patriarch of an organized crime syndicate founded on drugs, loan sharking, gambling and prostitution. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bacow </PERSON>, a writer, producer and labor negotiator, claimed to have known <PERSON> Lansky </PERSON> personally and said in 1987 he already had a <PERSON> Lansky </PERSON> script in hand. <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Giaquinto </PERSON>, then president of <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s Home Video Division, tentatively offered to pay <PERSON> Bacow </PERSON> $ 4.5 million for the video and pay-television rights to the film if it was made, the newspaper said. But <PERSON> Bacow </PERSON> said <PERSON> Caan </PERSON> was proposing his own <PERSON> Lansky </PERSON> project and allegedly told several reputed members of the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Mafia family during a dinner party that the rival movie would `` never be distributed,'' according to the newspaper. <PERSON> Caan </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Santarelli </PERSON>, said the actor dined with Mafia figures but neither made nor was aware of any attempt to interfere with <PERSON> Bacow </PERSON>'s project. He called the dinners actor's research, saying <PERSON> Caan </PERSON> has had a fascination with organized crime figures since his Oscar-nominated performance in `` The Godfather.'' There is no evidence he knew that the mob tried to intercede on his behalf, the newspaper said. But the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> is investigating whether <PERSON> Genovese </PERSON> family members tried to pressure <PERSON> Bacow </PERSON> and <PERSON> Giaquinto </PERSON>. Federal agents also contend <PERSON> Giaquinto </PERSON> said in a telephone call that he had thwarted Genovese pressure tactics by getting help from the Gambino crime family. <PERSON> Giaquinto </PERSON> was unavailable for comment Sunday. He was put on forced leave of absence from <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION>, and his attorney, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crain </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, does not have a local telephone listing. A call to <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> was not answered.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> observers called <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON>'s presidential election a success despite widespread violence and a rebel intimidation campaign. `` Based upon our observations, our determination is that the election was free and fair,'' the 21-member delegation said in a report released late Sunday. The presidential commission arrived in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> on Saturday and was to leave today. They visited about 50 of the nation's 262 precincts. `` I think I'll call it a successful election. It was n't peaceful, but it was successful,'' Sen. <PERSON> Mitch </PERSON> <PERSON> McConnell </PERSON>, R-Ky., the delegation chariman, told a news conference Sunday evening after the polls closed <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> praised the voting as a victory over leftist rebels who have been at war with the U.S.-backed government for nine years. `` This nation wants to govern itself with the most powerful ammunition there is: the vote,'' the Republican governor said. Despite widespread fighting between government troops and the guerrillas, the observers were never exposed to combat or attack, officials said. The observers said they talked to voters, election workers and soldiers. `` What we have observed in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> is a passionate commitment of a people to participate in the democratic process despite being faced with: intimidation, threats, violence and death from persons outside the political process,'' the report said. Still, observer <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Doherty </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> said rebel intimidation hindered the voting. `` We have still got a long way to go until we call this a democracy,'' he said. The White House named the official delegation of <ORGANIZATION> congress </ORGANIZATION> members, state politicans and private citizens. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> selected the precincts the observers visited by motorcade and helicopter. Earlier in the day, delegation members said the balloting appeared to be conducted under conditions designed to prevent fraud. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said the rebels `` did n't stop a lot of people voting today. We saw nothing but essentially a civic fiesta.'' Delegation member Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dornan </PERSON>, R-Calif., said he welcomed a victory by the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, or <PERSON> Arena </PERSON>, over the incumbent <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> `` Now I see that the momentum has changed to the Arena party,'' <PERSON> Dornan </PERSON> said. `` I'm a conservative. It's time for my guys to win.'' Rep. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, D-Calif., said <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> supporters apparently turned out strongly, lining up at polling stations in the capital and countryside `` It looks like they -LRB- the voters -RRB- were chosen by the Arena party,'' he said. <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> said disputes may arise in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> after the election because current policies have not brought an end to the war and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will need to debate whether military and economic aid to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> should continue at present levels.

 Nineteen Marines were killed and 16 injured today when a helicopter crashed in remote mountains, officials said. It was the second Marine chopper disaster in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> in four days. The troop-carrying CH53-D Sea Stallion helicopter crashed near the port of Pohang on the southeast coast while taking part in exercises with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> forces, a <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>. spokesman said. All 34 Marines aboard the aircraft were killed or injured, the spokesman said on condition of anonymity. Those hurt included 15 Marines aboard the helicopter and one hurt on the ground during rescue operations. Nine of the injured were listed in very serious condition with burns, four were in serious condition, and the status of three was undetermined, hospital officials said. Marine officials initially said 22 Marines were killed in the crash, but later lowered the figure to 19 because of confusion in early reports from the crash site. The helicopter was carrying four crewmen and 30 infantrymen when it crashed, the spokesman said. The infantrymen were from the 1st Battalion, 5th Marines of the 1st Marine Division based at <LOCATION> Camp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pendleton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, he said. Marine officials said they had no immediate word on what caused the crash. Little of the helicopter was left but charred pieces of wreckage. <PERSON> Yonhap </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> news agency, cited <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> military officials as saying the helicopter exploded in the air and burst into flames before slamming into the ground. The report said the helicopter appeared to have a problem in its engines. A <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> newspaper, the <ORGANIZATION> Kookmin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ilbo </ORGANIZATION>, quoted a farmer who saw the crash as saying two helicopters were hovering about 250 feet above the ground when one suddenly turned upside down and plunged into a creek. About 10 soldiers leaped out of the helicopter as it hit the ground, the report said. Investigators were sent to the crash site to try to determine what happened, but no quick results were expected, the Marine spokesman said. It was the second fatal crash involving a <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> helicopter in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> in four days. All four Marines aboard a CH-46 helicopter were killed Friday when their craft crashed in a rice paddy on the east coast. Marine investigators are still trying to determine the cause of Friday's crash. Both helicopters were taking part in annual `` Team Spirit'' exercises involving about 200,000 <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops. The exercises practice bringing in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> reinforcements in the event of a communist North Korean attack. Both aircraft were operating temporarily from the <ORGANIZATION> USS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Belleau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wood </ORGANIZATION>, a Marine assault ship located off the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> coast during the joint maneuvers, which began Tuesday. Marine officials withheld the identity of the victims in today's crash pending notification of relatives Some of the injured were taken to the <LOCATION> Belleau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wood </LOCATION>, and others were evacuated to a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hospital in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. The helicopter itself was assigned to the <ORGANIZATION> 1st </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wing </ORGANIZATION> based at <ORGANIZATION> Futenma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the officials said. The helicopter involved in the crash Friday was assigned to the 13th Marine Expeditionary Unit, also based at <LOCATION> Camp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pendleton </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has about 43,000 troops based in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> under a mutual defense treaty. About 30,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other parts of <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> are in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to take part in the maneuvers.

<TEXT>
 The top judges in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>'s federal district, state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> and state <ORGANIZATION> Appellate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> are women, but the members of this unique judicial troika say women still have ground to make up. <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Bree </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> is chief judge for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ash </PERSON> <PERSON> Peters </PERSON> is chief justice of the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Antoinette </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dupont </PERSON> is chief judge of the <ORGANIZATION> Appellate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. The state attorney general also is a woman. <PERSON> Clarine </PERSON> <PERSON> Nardi </PERSON> <PERSON> Riddle </PERSON> was promoted to acting attorney general when her former boss, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lieberman </PERSON>, won a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat in November. No other state has a similar combination of top female jurists, and the judges say the distinction underscores not how far women have come, but how far they have to go. `` Overall, one ca n't be overjoyed by the fact that a few of us do have positions that are conspicuous,'' said <PERSON> Peters </PERSON>, 58, who was appointed to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in 1978 and became chief justice in 1984. `` There's more to be done and the fact that I'm the chief justice, <PERSON> Antoinette </PERSON> <PERSON> Dupont </PERSON> is the chief judge in the <ORGANIZATION> Appellate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Bree </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> is the chief judge in the federal district and <PERSON> Clarine </PERSON> <PERSON> Nardi </PERSON> <PERSON> Riddle </PERSON> is attorney general, does n't mean it's over. The country's only other female state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> chief justice is <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Comstock </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. In the federal system, <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> serves as chief judge for the <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>. Of the state appellate courts, only <ORGANIZATION> Dupont </ORGANIZATION> serves as a chief judge, said <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lattimore </PERSON>, staff director for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judges </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Williamsburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION>. Nationally, 1,200 of 25,000 state judges are women. These include 30 women <ORGANIZATION> supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> court </ORGANIZATION> justices and 66 appellate judges, <PERSON> Lattimore </PERSON> said. `` We are at a point in our history where women are entering the state courts of last resort -LRB- supreme courts -RRB-,'' he said. The ranks of female jurists is bound to increase because about half of the students in law schools now are women, <PERSON> Lattimore </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, an assistant political science professor at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said women are bringing a fresh perspective to courtrooms. `` Some say they are more compassionate and others say they are more attuned to gender bias,'' said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, who has a $ 10,000 grant from the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Politics </ORGANIZATION> to study the influence of women in the nation's state supreme courts. A state task force is preparing a report on gender bias in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> courts based on testimony gathered during public hearings last year. The report is expected to cite examples of bias including male attorneys frequently addressing female witnesses by their first names while being more formal with male witnesses. Members of the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> have asked female judicial candidates whether their family life would interfere with judicial affairs. One candidate was asked if she would be able to meet mortgage payments on a judge's salary. The three judges say signs of continuing gender bias do n't suprise them They saw plenty while breaking into the legal profession in the 1950s. `` You were often told: ` We do n't hire women because our clients do n't like women lawyers,''' said 60-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Dupont </ORGANIZATION>, recalling her days as an attorney in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>, 65, recalled the cold reception she got at lawyers' function years ago `` I went to a <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Haven </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> meeting and they told me I was in the wrong place,'' she said. `` I assured them that if this was a bar association meeting, then I was in the right place.''

 Rioters broke windows and spray-painted buildings in a Moslem neighborhood of this northern city with slogans of support for <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, whose novel `` The Satanic Verses'' has enraged many Moslems. Reporters saw windows smashed, small trees pulled up, paint sprayed on cars, homes and religious centers, and painted slogans demanding <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> be left in peace. No injuries were reported after the rampage Sunday night. Many Moslems believe <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s novel blasphemes their religion. After protests in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, and other countries against the book, <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> on Feb. 14 called on Moslems to seek out and kill <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>. The novelist, a naturalized Briton born to a Moslem family in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, has since gone into hiding. The <LOCATION> Sheffield </LOCATION> neighborhood where the rioting occurred is mainly inhabited by Pakistanis. The words, `` Pakis die,'' were scrawled on a mosque. Police said they made no immediate arrests. `` Community relations in this area are good. We can not say what is behind the incidents at this stage,'' said a police spokesman who would not give his name. `` So many cars and homes were attacked it seems like the work of an organized gang,'' said city councilman <PERSON> Choudry </PERSON> <PERSON> Walayat </PERSON>. Local lawmaker <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> said: `` In the context of the <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> affair, it is very alarming.'' At least 19 people have been killed in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> in riots protesting the novel.

<HEAD>Socialist Party Gains in Several Large Cities</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFFREY ULBRICH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Socialists wrested control of several large cities from conservative and center-right parties in municipal elections that party leaders said represented a vote of confidence in President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterand </PERSON>. `` It's a very beautiful and very ample victory for the president, the government and the presidential majority,'' Socialist Premier <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> said of the results in Sunday's vote. `` It is the first time that we have seen a government receive a powerful, popular encouragement during the municipal elections,'' said Socialist Interior Minister <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Joxe </PERSON>. The first round of the municipal elections was held last week. In communities where no slate won 50 percent of the vote then, all slates that won at least 10 percent were eligible to participate in the second round. Turnout in this ninth trip to the polls for the French in less than a year was estimated at between 72 and 73.5 percent. Conservative bastions such as <LOCATION> Strasbourg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mulhouse </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brest </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Dunkirk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Blois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Avignon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Quimper </LOCATION> fell into Socialist hands on Sunday. The right made some inroads into leftist territory, but in general won fewer, smaller cities. Many of the conservatives' problems were caused by the extreme right <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, which siphoned votes from the traditional rightist parties in the runoffs. The conservative Rally for the Republic -LRB- RPR -RRB- and the center-right <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- UDF -RRB- refused to deal with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> for second-round support. `` It would be an exaggeration to believe that we are seeing a grassroots wave for the presidential majority,'' said <ORGANIZATION> RPR </ORGANIZATION> Secretary General <PERSON> Alain </PERSON> <PERSON> Juppe </PERSON>. `` It's true that the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is retaking a part of the terrain that it had lost in 1983, but only a part.'' The overall number of municipalities with a population of more than 30,000 lost by the right was small, but the right lost important cities while taking smaller, less important ones from the left. The right had made serious gains in the country's city councils in 1983, two years after the Socialists came to power nationally. Said former conservative Premier <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>, mayor of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> who turned in one of the few smashing victories of the night: `` On the national level, we have seen the Socialists win back cities they lost six years ago. And it is a victory for them. On the other hand, the number of abstentionists, the large number of votes for the Ecologist and <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> slates, expresses a malaise.'' Perhaps the Socialists' most satisfying victory came in <LOCATION> Strasbourg </LOCATION>, where they ousted an incumbent center-right mayor in an election in which the Ecologist slate also won 12 percent. The results confirmed the leftist trend that re-elected <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> last spring and gave him a leftist majority in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. Frequently, local elections are used as a means of protesting government policy, but that was not the case this year. Races largely were fought on local issues. There was a little good news on the right, however. <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>, who won a `` grand slam'' in 1983 by taking all 20 of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>' districts, repeated the feat, despite a cliffhanger in the 20th district where <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Jean-Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON>'s slate drew away a lot of votes. It was satisfying for <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>, who took a battering from <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> in presidential elections last May. Another `` grand slam'' was registered by <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noir </PERSON>, a conservative deputy in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> and former foreign trade minister. Noir, a dynamic, 45-year-old politician, won all nine of the districts in the southeastern city of <LOCATION> Lyon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s third-largest municipality, defeating a center-right incumbent <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON> said the traditional right's strategy of refusing to deal with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> had failed yet again. `` The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> has shown by its sucess that it -LRB- accepting the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- is unavoidable.'' The Front's campaign focusings largely on anti-immigration and law and order issues.

<TEXT>
 A 43-hour hostage siege ended in tragedy when a `` mentally deranged'' gunman killed his girlfriend, critically wounded her sister and then fatally shot himself, authorities said. The bodies were discovered Sunday evening after police fired tear gas into the heavily barricaded house. `` We thought that it got to the point after 40 hours of negotiating that we had done all that we could and we were concerned about the lives of the two remaining hostages,'' said Police Chief <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Walton </PERSON>. Police fired the first of two tear gas volleys into the house about 20 minutes after the gunman, <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> `` Dougie'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, had discarded the phone he had been using to talk with police, <PERSON> Walton </PERSON> said. `` The negotiations got to the point where it was n't negotiating,'' <PERSON> Walton </PERSON> said `` He never had any demands. He never had anything. He was mentally deranged.'' Police rushed the house after they heard <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> singing, <PERSON> Walton </PERSON> said. Two wounded hostages were found by the front door under several quilts, the chief said. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> and his girlfriend, <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Lambert </PERSON>, both 20, were dead of gunshot wounds when they arrived at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, said <LOCATION> Sangamon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Coroner <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Richter </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Lambert </PERSON>'s 14-year-old sister, <PERSON> Nicole </PERSON>, was in critical condition today after surgery for a gunshot wound to the head, hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Agnes </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayner </PERSON> said. During the standoff, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> released unharmed his girlfriend's 4-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Katrina </PERSON> <PERSON> Lambert </PERSON>, after police cut off electricity and gas to the house, said police Cmdr <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Searcy </PERSON>. Another hostage, <PERSON> Kelisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Lambert </PERSON>, the 2 -LCB- - month-old daughter of <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> and his girlfriend, was released Saturday, police said Police did not know what led <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> to take the hostages, <PERSON> Walton </PERSON> said. Heavily armed police had surrounded the house, which <PERSON> Searcy </PERSON> said is the home of the <PERSON> Lambert </PERSON> sisters and their mother. More than 30 families were evacuated Saturday from neighboring houses. Police were called to the house late Friday in response to a report of a domestic disturbance. Police spokesman <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> was hospitalized recently for depression, and police believe he had been taking medication that might have affected his moods. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> spent a year in prison for shooting two men at a dance in 1985. A judge reduced charges of attempted murder to two counts of aggravated battery, because a question existed about whether <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> intended to kill the men.

 A political game of musical chairs has some Republicans fearing they could be left standing in the cold while the Democrats plop into a <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> congressional seat. On March 28, for the second time in less than five months, voters will elect a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> representative from northeast <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>'s 4th District. Last November, the seat was again a Republican shoo-in, little-watched as political interests focused on closer races. The good fortune of two <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> Republicans, however, may have changed that. With the election of <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> to the vice presidency and the appointment of incumbent Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Coats </PERSON> to fill <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s vacated <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat, Republicans were forced to pick a special election candidate from a field of relative unknowns. Against the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> choice, the Democrats already had decided to run <PERSON> Jill </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON>, a candidate with a mixed resume. Long already had lost two races for federal office, both by wide margins: <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> defeated her in 1986 to win a second <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> term and Coats repeated the drubbing in 1988 for his fifth House term. The Republicans picked <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Heath </PERSON>, a 36-year-old aide to <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Helmke </PERSON>. <PERSON> Heath </PERSON>, an attorney with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> experience as a member of Coats' staff, had never sought elective office. He began the campaign largely unrecognized outside <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION>, where he had served <PERSON> Helmke </PERSON>'s administration as public safety director, Republicans concede. Long, on the other hand, despite her defeats, was better known among voters when the campaign began in mid-January. With both parties predicting an extremely low voter turnout, Republicans fear a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidate could slip through the lines. `` There's nothing we'll need to do that we wo n't do,'' said <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Galen </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` We're not going to lose this seat.'' The committee has given <PERSON> Heath </PERSON>'s campaign access to active contributors, help with voter turnout programs and phone banks. The <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> committee and the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> may spend an estimated $ 50,000 in cash and even more with in-kind contributions on the campaign. Democrats concede the circumstances of a special election mean problems for their candidate as well. A low voter turnout in a district that has voted 2-1 Republican in past congressional races may still favor the GOP. And Long, as well as <PERSON> Heath </PERSON>, has had trouble igniting enthusiasm among party stalwarts during the relatively brief period between nomination and election, both sides say. Neither candidate has a lengthy public record to run on, or to attack. Long has attempted to play on a perceived resentment of attorneys, frequently pointing out that <PERSON> Heath </PERSON> holds a law degree and contending that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> does n't need another lawyer. <PERSON> Heath </PERSON> reaches back more than a decade to critize Long for supporting a local tax increase while a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Valparaiso </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> in the 1970s. He has attempted to tag Long as a liberal, with one advertisement combining photos of Long and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the 1988 Democratic presidential candidate whose unsuccessful campaign was wounded by the same label.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> have decided not to advertise any more on <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Nightingales,'' which has provoked criticism from women because it has shown scantily clad nurses. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> advertised on one episode of the Wednesday night series about student nurses because <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> owed it time, said <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Houston </PERSON>. But, `` based on the response we got from viewers, which was obviously negative,'' the company reviewed the show and decided not to continue, <PERSON> Houston </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> ran a few commercials about its new pricing strategy, but `` we pulled the one more that we had because we decided that the program did not meet our guidelines as suitable for family viewing,'' said a spokeswoman, <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Gucfa </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nursing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said last week it has circulated lists of `` Nightingales'' advertisers to its 189,000 members, urging them to `` communicate their concerns'' about the series, which began Jan. 25. `` Nightingales'' exploits women, said association spokeswoman <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Grimaldi </PERSON>. `` It uses nurses to show these very pretty girls in their underwear and in the shower,'' <PERSON> Grimaldi </PERSON> said. `` It shows very lax educational standards _ when it does say anything about nursing education.'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> responded that `` ` Nightingales' is a continuing drama about the personal lives of fictional people who happen to be nurses.'' The network noted that a registered nurse reviews every script and consults with the production company on nursing procedures and other medical aspects. `` It's a drama about young women coming of age in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> today,'' added <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> publicist <PERSON> Merry </PERSON> <PERSON> Aronson </PERSON>. `` It's very focused on their personal lives.

 An angry crowd chanting `` Devil!'' drove away family members from their house, where authorities said the body of a neighborhood teen-ager had been found two weeks earlier. The dead girl's uncle, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Player </PERSON>, said Sunday that neighbors will `` never allow these people to ever live here again.'' More than 40 people taunted the <PERSON> Golub </PERSON> family outside the <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> residence where the body of <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> <PERSON> Tinyes </PERSON>, 13, was found March 4. The <PERSON> Golub </PERSON> family returned to the house Saturday night for the first time since investigators ordered them out. `` Monsters! Seed of the devil! Get out,'' jeered members of the crowd, which included the dead girl's father, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Tinyes </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Tinyes </PERSON> was seen entering the <PERSON> Golub </PERSON> home March 3, but was never seen leaving. Her body was found in the basement, authorities said. Investigators had ordered the Golubs to vacate their house because it was the scene of the crime. Police have said the only two suspects in the case were the two <PERSON> Golub </PERSON> brothers, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON>, 21, and <PERSON> John </PERSON>, 14, but no arrests have been made. The <LOCATION> Nassau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> district attorney plans to present evidence to a grand jury on Wednesday. The two-hour verbal assault on the family began when <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Golub </PERSON> left the house on foot and was followed by <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Tinyes </PERSON> and an angry crowd. A <LOCATION> Nassau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> police spokesman, Officer <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Koller </PERSON>, said a patrolling officer saw <PERSON> Golub </PERSON> being followed and called for assistance. When <PERSON> Golub </PERSON> reached a grocery store about six blocks from his home, some of those following repeatedly called him a `` devil.'' Eight police cars arrived, and officers protected <PERSON> Golub </PERSON> as he left the store with his older sister, <PERSON> Adele </PERSON>, who had come to pick him up in a car. The shouting continued, with one member of the crowd calling out to Ms. <PERSON> Golub </PERSON>, `` You are a devil for being with him.'' Ms. <PERSON> Golub </PERSON> yelled back, `` My brothers were innocent,'' then broke into sobs. As neighbors continued to shout outside the home, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Adele </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> and their mother, <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>, left the house and drove away. About 10 minutes later, their father, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, left in a separate car, to the applause of the crowd. The Golubs' destination was not known, said <PERSON> Koller </PERSON>. The family's lawyer, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Grady </PERSON>, said: `` They pay taxes on the house there, so why should n't the Golubs go back home? Where else are they supposed to go? ... Should they be deprived of going home?'' He said the family had not requested police protection. One neighbor, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> DeLuca </PERSON>, told reporters: `` We're not vigilantes; we would not have killed them. We are aware they have due process of law. But based on the circumstantial evidence, how could you just come back?''

 The dollar was mixed in thin European trading today. Gold prices were little changed. Foreign currency dealers said interest in dollar-buying was dampened by fears of central bank intervention. Central banks in several <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> countries reportedly intervened in the currency markets on Thursday and Friday. `` It's very quiet,'' said a trader at a large West German bank in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>. `` I do n't think the dollar is going to do much today.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> wants to upgrade the level of its talks with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> so <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> can take part, the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Riyadh </LOCATION> said today. Ambassador <PERSON> Rafik </PERSON> <PERSON> Natsheh </PERSON> reiterated the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> position while denying a published report that said <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> would participate at the next round of the PLO-U.S. talks on Wednesday in <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>. `` <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> will not take part in the talks with the Americans at the level of ambassadors,'' said <PERSON> Natsheh </PERSON>. `` We are demanding that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> upgrade the level of the talks so that <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Ammar </PERSON> can take part.'' <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Ammar </PERSON> is an <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> nickname. To upgrade the talks would be place them on a level `` commensurate with the developments in the region,'' said <PERSON> Natsheh </PERSON>, who also expressed `` strong displeasure ... at the slow pace'' of the dialogue to date. He added: `` We look forward to serious American-Palestinian talks through which we can reach a just settlement that guarantees the Palestinian people's rights.'' The dialogue began formally on Dec. 16 when <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lifted a 13-year ban on official dealings with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> after <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, which acts as a parliament-in-exile, made clear their acceptance of the state of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and renounced terrorism. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> is seeking to create a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, where Palestinians have been demonstrating for 15 months against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 21-year military occupation. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelletreau </PERSON>, is the highest ranking American diplomat authorized to handle discussions with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. The session in <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> on Wednesday will only be the second formal session, but there have been informal contacts between <PERSON> Pelletreau </PERSON> and the Palestinians. His PLO counterpart in the talks has been <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Abed-Rabbo </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> executive committee. A weekend report in the Kuwaiti newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Al-Rai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Al-Aam </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> would sit opposite <PERSON> Pelletreau </PERSON> at the Wednesday session. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> is presently in the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> capital of <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> has military headquarters. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Salah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalaf </PERSON>, <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s second-in-command in the mainstream <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> group <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION>, was quoted as saying that no particular agenda has been fixed for the Wednesday session. <PERSON> Khalaf </PERSON>, in statements published in the <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Okaz </ORGANIZATION>, said the talks will be open to deal with `` all issues and measures related to developments of the Palestinian case and the practical American steps to solve the problem.'' <PERSON> Khalaf </PERSON> also disclosed that <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> will be holding a summit session with President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in April. Under the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> umbrella are several organizations which sometimes battle among themselves. In Damscus, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, the dissident <ORGANIZATION> Palestinian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fatah-Uprising </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla group threatened Sunday to assassinate Palestinians who make direct contact with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leaders. In a statement sent to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, Fatah-Uprising particularly mentioned people `` considered by the enemy close to the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>.'' It gave no names in the threat, which apparently was designed to jeopardize <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s peace initiatives. On Friday, <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Bassam </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON> said several Palestinians have been meeting with the Israelis. <ORGANIZATION> Fatah-Uprising </ORGANIZATION>, a Syrian-backed group led by Col. <PERSON> Saeed </PERSON> <PERSON> Mousa </PERSON>, broke away from <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s mainstream <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> movement in 1983.

 Two children were rescued unharmed when police stormed a townhouse, shot a blind escaped murderer to death and captured his partner to end a 34-hour standoff. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> was holding a knife at the throat of 6-year-old Cameo <PERSON> Platt </PERSON> when officers stormed the house early Sunday and an officer fired a single shot that struck <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> in the face, said police Capt. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Erickson </PERSON>. The girl's 8-year-old brother, <PERSON> Dominic </PERSON>, was nearby when the shooting occurred. Police had detonated two `` flash-bang'' grenades before bursting into the home. Such grenades are designed for shock value rather than to cause injury. <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, an inmate at <LOCATION> Stillwater </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prison </LOCATION> east of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION>, escaped from a medical office Friday morning while he was being escorted by two guards to an appointment for a replacement of his glass eye. His accomplice, <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, armed with a handgun and wearing a Halloween mask, appeared at the downtown office and helped him overpower the guards and escape, police said. The men then went to <PERSON> Lois </PERSON> <PERSON> Platt </PERSON>'s house in this town south of Minneapolis-St. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> and initially held her and her children Police grabbed <PERSON> Platt </PERSON> when she left the house Saturday morning to start a car. She struggled with officers when they refused to let her return to her children, said Police Capt. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>. Police decided to move into the house early Sunday after the men threatened to kill one of the children if they were n't allowed to leave. `` They said they had to be allowed to leave. If they did n't, they were going to throw a dead child out,'' said <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>. `` We basically had a hard decision to make as to when the best opportunity would present itself and we had to be ready to go when it did.'' The special weapons and tactics team moved in when the door opened for soft drinks to be delivered. `` The children seemed perfectly fine when we found them. They cried and said they missed their mother,'' <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Platt </PERSON> had corresponded with <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> in prison, but her sister-in-law, <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Platt </PERSON>, said she broke off the relationship more than 18 months ago when she discovered <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> had been convicted of strangling his girlfriend. <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, 49, was sentenced to 27 years in prison on a charge of second-degree murder in 1982 and was serving his fifth prison stint, said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Dowdle </PERSON>, associate warden at the <LOCATION> Stillwater </LOCATION> prison. He also had convictions for rape, robbery, criminal sexual assault, burglary and illegal handgun possession. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a former inmate at the <LOCATION> Stillwater </LOCATION> prison, sustained a minor injury and was treated at a hospital before being jailed, said Police Chief <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivers </PERSON>.

 Thousands of people welcomed the return of the swallows to Mission San <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Capistrano </PERSON>, but they were a little late: The birds arrived in February. Tourists came from as far away as <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to witness the traditional St. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>'s Day arrival. There may have been few swallows, but 94-year-old <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Arbiso </PERSON> began his annual rite of ringing the mission courtyard bells on schedule on Sunday, which also marked the 50th anniversary of <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Rene </PERSON>'s 1939 song, `` When the Swallows Come Back to <PERSON> Capistrano </PERSON>.'' `` For the air fare that I paid from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, I wanted swarms,'' said <PERSON> Colleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunn-Holzworth </PERSON>, 21, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Rutgers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> student spending spring break in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Yolonda </PERSON>'s first lesson about guns was almost her last. It happened two years ago while she was taking a nap, the third-grader said. `` I felt something very, very hard under the mattress,'' she said. `` I picked up the mattress and I saw a big old gun and it almost went off.'' In the <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> public schools, children are no strangers to guns. Thirty-eight students died of gunshot wounds in the first 11 months of 1988. The public school system has gotten into the business of gun education, launching a `` Say No to Guns'' program modeled after the `` Just Say No To Drugs'' campaign. `` It's just another ` no,''' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, safety and driver education supervisor with the <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Public Schools. Superintendent <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> issued a memo alerting staff that gun safety would be a priority. Last Dec. 9 was proclaimed `` Gun Safety Awareness Day.'' Principals in all the county's schools delivered messages on firearm safety to kick off the program, which was supported by posters. At <PERSON> Yolonda </PERSON>'s elementary school in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Overtown </LOCATION>, notorious as the scene of civil disturbances, high crime rates have given the neighborhood an atmosphere reminiscent of frontier days in the last century. `` It's very scary sometimes,'' first grade teacher <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Banky </PERSON> said. `` Some of the parents come in and they're actually carrying guns.'' One of her students, a 6-year-old, has been instructed in how to use a gun by a guardian, who told the teacher, `` If they're left alone they have to know how to protect themselves.'' <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said the typical gun casualty is `` a 10 - to 12-year-old male playing with a gun with a friend at one of their houses. When the county decided to address the issue of gun safety, school board members wanted to investigate existing programs. They checked with other school systems and learned there were none. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> offered its program, which features a coloring book and a poster. The poster instructs children not to touch a gun if they find one. Instead, it tells them to leave the area and tell an adult. But the art work shows a gun lying on a table. `` Some of the senior staff believed the message was subliminal,'' telling children it's OK to have guns left out, <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said. The gun lobby is concerned that the <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> program teaches children to fear guns. `` Some of it may instill fear among children,'' <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said. `` We do n't have any problem with that. `` We want to teach them to have respect for guns _ so much that they do n't touch them.''

The official start of Spring was this morning at 10:28 a.m. EST, and it meant springlike storms for parts of southern and western <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> as moist air surged north from the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and strong thunderstorms developed in the unstable air mass. Showers and thunderstorms also broke out northeast of a low centered over the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Panhandle </LOCATION>, stretching from <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> across central Missouri into southern <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. Elsewhere, winter held on. The <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Panhandle low sent snow across the central and southern <LOCATION> Rockies </LOCATION>. Snow was expected to accumulate up to 8 inches today along the front range of the <ORGANIZATION> Rockies </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>.

A mixture of snow and rain fell in northern <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. Winter storm watches were posted for tonight for the south central mountains and central highlands of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and portions of northwest <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. A cold front dipped into the central <ORGANIZATION> Rockies </ORGANIZATION> and the central Plains this morning and continued to head south toward the <LOCATION> southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>. Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms from the southern Plains across the middle <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> valleys to <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and across to the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>; widespread rain in the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>; and snow in northern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> region, the central High Plains and southern <LOCATION> Rockies </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 West German authorities showed British experts a bomb disguised as a radio-cassette player five weeks before a similar device blew up <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 and killed 270 people, an official said today. The statement by <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Bachmeier </PERSON> came amid criticism that British authorities knew such a bombing was possible but failed to warn airlines prior to the Dec. 21 disaster. British authorities acknowledged Sunday that a warning about such a disguised bomb was not mailed to airlines until after the tragedy. Also today, West German authorities denied a report by <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Sunday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> that said a Libyan terrorism mastermind known as `` The Professor'' was believed to have plotted the tragedy <PERSON> Bachmeier </PERSON> said British authorities attended a briefing by the West German <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> on Nov. 15 at which an explosive device hidden in a radio-cassette player was demonstrated. The radio-cassette player contained a plastic explosive and a timing device that authorities have said are the same as those used in the bomb that destroyed the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 over <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. The bomb shown to British authorities had been seized by West German police during an Oct. 26 raid on a hideout of the <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine-General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> in the city of <LOCATION> Neuss </LOCATION>. `` They were in possession of all the information,'' <PERSON> Bachmeier </PERSON> said, adding that the British security experts took photographs and made detailed notes on the disguised bomb. Both <PERSON> Bachmeier </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Prechtel </PERSON>, a spokesman for the West German Federal Prosecutor's Office, denied that authorities had identified the perpetrator. The Sunday Express, quoting unidentified West German detectives, said authorities believe the bombing was plotted by a Libyan nicknamed `` The Professor'' by international security agencies. The weekly said Lebanese student <PERSON> Khalid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaafar </PERSON>, 20, of <LOCATION> Dearborn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, probably unwittingly carried the bomb on board hidden in a radio-cassette player which the Libyan had given him. He was killed in the crash. Earlier news reports in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> have quoted unidentified sources as saying <PERSON> Jaafar </PERSON> may have carried the bomb when he boarded Flight 103 in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> has questioned his father, <PERSON> Nazir </PERSON>, who has denied those reports. The flight originated in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, then changed planes in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> for a flight to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The Sunday Express said the <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> _ whom it did not name _ flew to <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> on Dec. 13 and met an <LOCATION> Iranian </LOCATION> diplomat who let him work from the Iranian Embassy. It said he stayed in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> at least until Jan. 6. He was seen three weeks ago driving a car with German license plates in <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>, the report said. The report said `` The Professor'' trained as a member of an elite squad in the Libyan army in the 1960s and called him a master of electronics, explosives and forgery. The Sunday Express said the Libyan trained recruits for a Libya-backed group headed by <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON>, who has been blamed for attacks on the <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> airports in 1985 and other terrorist incidents. The paper said the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> has confirmed the man was being hunted in connection with the bombing. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Gladis </PERSON> on Sunday declined to comment on the report. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Channon </PERSON> was under pressure to explain or resign over his department's handling of warnings received before the bombing. `` Unless he comes to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION> at the earliest opportunity next week and is competely candid in every detail, the demand for an official inquiry on both sides of the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> will become irresistible,'' said <PERSON> Paddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashdown </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Channon </PERSON> said Sunday he told <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> `` as much as it is in my power to tell.'' Government ministers `` should not go around revealing things that might be against the national interest,'' he told the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> confirmed last week it prepared a warning dated Dec. 19 that included photographs of a bomb hidden in a radio-cassette player but did not mail it until after Christmas. A department spokesman said the warning was not sent until the New Year because the accompanying photos had to be prepared. The spokesman, who demanded anonymity, did not give the exact date of the mailing. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> has said it received the letter Jan. 17.

<TEXT>
 A small circulation Soviet magazine has printed an essay <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Solzhenitsyn </PERSON> wrote shortly before he was forced into exile in which he appeals to his countrymen to cast off officially-sanctioned lies. The magazine also carried a commentary crediting the Nobel laureate for helping prepare the way for President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms. The publication represents another step in the gradual rehabilitation of an author whose major works remain banned in his homeland. However, the magazine did not publish <PERSON> Solzhenitsyn </PERSON>'s most trenchent criticisms of Soviet politics, including his charge that repression has been a key element of <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> policy since the days of <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>. Moreover, the essay was printed in a magazine destined in part for foreign markets, selling 50,000 copies abroad in Russian, English, French, Spanish and German, and with only a 100,000-copy circulation at home. The 2 -LCB- - page essay `` Live Not by Lies! was published in the February bulletin of the officially sanctioned <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s monthly, Twentieth Century and Peace. It was written shortly before <PERSON> Solzhenitsyn </PERSON> was arrested and expelled from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for his writings. In the essay, which was circulated at the time in thousands of illegal self-published copies, <PERSON> Solzhenitsyn </PERSON> called on his countrymen to display courage and resist pressure from the country's rulers. An honest man, wrote <PERSON> Solzhenitsyn </PERSON>, `` does not raise his hand to vote for a proposal that he does not sincerely sympathize with, does not vote either openly or in secret for a person he believes is unworthy or doubtful.'' That sort of language, considered anti-Soviet and seditious under President <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>'s rule in the 1970s, is now fully in line with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s calls for greater openness, civic responsibility and democracy. Author <PERSON> Igor </PERSON> <PERSON> Vinogradov </PERSON>, in the commentary appended to <PERSON> Solzhenitsyn </PERSON>'s essay, called the arrest and banishment of the 1970 Nobel Prize winner `` a shameful act'' and lauded the writer's `` high spiritual and civic courage.'' Without such brave people who spoke out against abuses of the Soviet rulers of their time, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s drive for `` perestroika,'' social and economic reforms, may never have come about, <PERSON> Vinogradov </PERSON> said. `` Those changes which started in our country three years ago _ could they be possible if in our society, in all its strata, contempt and loathing had not ripened among nearly everyone for those who personified the ruling evil and violence, and for their miserable servants, flooding the country with lies and demagoguery?'' he wrote. In an interview published today by <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Solzhenitsyn </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Natalia </PERSON>, who often speaks for him, said she was disappointed that the essay was published in such a small-circulation journal because the piece was written as a broad, national appeal. `` Given that this was meant as an address to the people, this is not the place it should be published,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Solzhenitsyn </PERSON> was quoted as saying in a telephone interview from her home in <LOCATION> Cavendish </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vt. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s ideology chief, said late last year he favored a continued ban on publishing works by <PERSON> Solzhenitsyn </PERSON> because they would undermine Soviet society `` I am against the publication of a number of works by <PERSON> Solzhenitsyn </PERSON> and in the first place such works as ` <ORGANIZATION> Lenin </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>' and ` The Gulag Archipelago,'' the Politburo member told a Nov. 29 news conference `` To publish <PERSON> Solzhenitsyn </PERSON>'s works would mean to, in effect, undermine the foundations on which today's life rests,'' <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> said. His remarks indicated there are still limits on the amount of openness allowed under <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms. <PERSON> Solzhenitsyn </PERSON>'s `` One Day in the Life of <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Denisovich </PERSON>,'' a chronicle of life in Soviet labor camps under dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>, was published in 1962 during the thaw allowed by <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> following <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s death. Some Soviet writers, artists and activists have clamored for the publication of <PERSON> Solzhenitsyn </PERSON>'s works and his return to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. In October, the filmmakers' union asked for a review of his 1974 expulsion.

<TEXT>
 The farm chemical Alar has for four years been a symbol of industrial arrogance and regulatory foot-dragging to followers of the consumer movement. But despite activists' efforts, it's a safe bet most Americans knew little or nothing about Alar, which is used to grow crisper, more colorful apples, and which has been linked to cancer in animal tests. That's changed dramatically in the last two weeks. The Alar-apple debate quickly gained public-policy star status through a `` 60 Minutes'' television report, the involvement of actress Meryl Streep and surprise moves by educators in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> to yank apples from school lunchrooms. Despite reassurances from the government and health establishment that Alar is n't all that unsafe, signs of alarm have mounted: _ By the end of last week, the heads of the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> both felt compelled to defend the nation's apple supply They were joined by Surgeon General <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Koop </PERSON>, who released a statement Saturday saying: `` I wish to send a message to mothers across the country: It's OK, Mom, apples are good for your kids!''' _ Apple growers in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state blamed the controversy for a drop of nearly 10 percent in shipments of apples out of state in two weeks _ Grocers and apple processing companies across the country reiterated policies against accepting apples sprayed with Alar Meanwhile, the manufacturer of the chemical, <ORGANIZATION> Uniroyal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Middlebury </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, has repeatedly cited research showing Alar in the concentrations found in apples does n't pose a cancer threat. The Alar debate has been around with varying degrees of fervor since August 1985, when the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> considered but rejected a ban on the chemical, used to control ripening and improve quality, consistency and shelf life of apples. In early February, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> finally did propose a phaseout of use of the chemical, which would take it off the market starting probably next year. But the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said the threat of Alar was not so severe that the ban had to start right away. Consumer groups, including <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nader </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, have campaigned for an immediate ban instead. The periodic consumer campaigns have prompted many big supermarket chains and apple processors across the country to quit accepting Alar-treated apples. As a result, use of the chemical fell to an estimated 5 percent to 10 percent of the crop from a high around 50 percent. Many growers hoped controversy was behind them. But on Feb. 26, the dormant controversy erupted anew. The <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> television show `` 60 Minutes'' reported a study by the Natural Resources group suggesting children, because of low body weight and proportionately high consumption of apples, had a heightened risk of cancer from Alar. Then Miss Streep appeared on TV talk shows and gave interviews about her fears for her three children's health. The resulting blast of publicity prompted officials in the nation's two biggest school districts, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, to temporarily pull apples and apple products from their cafeterias. Reports of the apple bans quickly spread. `` In our democratic process, an angry mob will be listened to no matter what the facts are,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Helmke </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, consultant with the <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lake </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lerer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> public relations firm. `` That's what's happened in this case _ this story has struck a nerve,'' <PERSON> Helmke </PERSON> said. Studies show Alar, a trade name for the chemical daminozide, could be linked to cancer in laboratory animals. A breakdown product of Alar called <ORGANIZATION> UDMH </ORGANIZATION> also was shown to cause cancer when give to test animals in large amounts. The American <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pediatrics </ORGANIZATION> adopted a position paper March 11 calling for an end to Alar use but said parents should n't worry about farm chemicals applied in legal amounts.

 Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> opened the annual session of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s legislature today by calling on Chinese to work harder and make more financial sacrifices to collectively overcome worsening economic woes. `` Both government and people should be mentally prepared for a few years of austerity,'' <PERSON> Li </PERSON> told more than 2,000 delegates at the Great Hall of the People in central <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. He urged officials to give up their `` vested interests in favor of the interests of the whole. `` If we set a good example and explain clearly to the people the need for tightening our belts, they will surely understand and support it,'' he said. The only exceptions <PERSON> Li </PERSON> made to the tight-money policy were agriculture and education. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said the education budget would be increased and more loans would be made to farmers. Sitting behind <PERSON> Li </PERSON> on the rostrum were other government and Communist Party leaders. Senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>, 84, was absent, but there was no official explanation. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> attended last year's opening session. The chair normally filled by <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>, next to <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON>, was filled by President <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Shangkun </PERSON>. Next to <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> sat <PERSON> Li </PERSON> and next to him sat Vice Premier <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Zheng </PERSON>. Two chairs were empty. The tone of <PERSON> Li </PERSON>'s speech contrasted with last year's, when he called for bold new efforts to move the economy away from rigid central planning that long stifled growth. Since then, however, inflation has climbed to a post-war record annual rate of 36 percent, and overheated demand has caused shortages, hoarding and several bank runs. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> blamed the economic problems on `` a tendency to be too impatient for quick results. `` More often than not we tended to ignore the fact that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has a huge population, is relatively short of resources and has an unevenly developed economy,'' <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said in a criticism of policies that he helped shape. `` We ... did not pay sufficient attention to taking comprehensive and coordinated measures and failed to tighten control and supervision at the right moment,'' he said. `` We were too optimistic.'' <PERSON> Li </PERSON> was interrupted by applause when he reaffirmed <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s claim to sovereignty over <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> and denounced foreign support of Tibetan separatism as `` outrageous interference in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s internal affairs.'' He also reiterated <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s position that it was justified in imposing martial law in <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> on March 8 after three days of anti-Chinese violence in which at least 12 people died. <LOCATION> Tibetan </LOCATION> activists claim the region was independent before the Communist takeover in 1950. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> did not mention letters sent to the congress by more than 100 intellectuals appealing for an amnesty for political prisoners, or the growing public clamor for greater freedom of speech. Most of <PERSON> Li </PERSON>'s speech was devoted to economic problems and austerity measures, including strengthening control over price increases, loans and new construction. However, he said the state would increase its grain purchase price by 18 percent beginning April 1 in an effort to end a four-year slump in production. Banks will increase agricultural loans, he said. `` Agriculture stands out as the weakest link in the national economy at present,'' he said. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> also announced a 15 percent increase in the education budget, to $ 10 billion. `` This figure is the best the government can do under the present tight budget, although it still falls far short of actual needs,'' he said. He said alternate sources of funding would have to be found. The congress meets through April 4 to hear more government reports and discuss proposed laws. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> delegates are elected by provincial congresses, which in turn are chosen by municipal and county congresses in each area. Citizens actually vote only for representatives in the lowest-level local congress.

 Republican political activists and business people from across the country contributed $ 105,000 to an unusual limited partnership that then paid to promote a book co-authored by Rep. <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, according to a published report today. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, R-Ga., has been a chief accuser of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> in an ethics investigation focusing on issues including a book deal for the speaker <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> also is a candidate in this week's Republican race to become <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> minority whip. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported today that <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> and his co-authors of a 1984 book set up the limited partnership that raised money for a promotion budget. The <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> asked the newspaper if he could delay his responses to its queries because a story that described his book deal as `` equally as weird as <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s'' would be to his `` disadvantage'' before the vote for minority whip, the No. 2 Republican leadership post in the House. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> has been accused of using a congressional aide to edit his book and of using bulk sales of the volume to interest groups as a way to make money while skirting limits on outside income. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> had acknowledged last summer, even as he raised questions about <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s ethics, that he once had a congressional aide work on `` Window of Opportunity,'' which he co-authored with his wife, <PERSON> Marianne </PERSON>, and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Drake </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> said his aide did much less work than <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s staffer did on the respective volumes. House Democrats last year also attacked <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> for a 1977 deal in which he allegedly was paid $ 13,000 for a book he never produced. Questioned on Friday about the limited partnership, <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> that it was set up with the idea that a large promotion budget could `` force a best-seller. I was real naive.'' Publishers normally pay promotion costs. The 21 investors each put up $ 5,000 and were to split half of the publisher's profits. However, the publisher lost money and the investors thus were able to take a tax writeoff, the paper said. Mrs. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> told the paper she had a share of the partnership and was paid almost $ 10,000 by it for her work as general partner. The congressman said the partnership was his idea. It spent $ 70,000 for promotion, while most of the rest of the money went for expenses, including the payment to Mrs. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>. The book sold about 12,000 hardcover copies and another 17,000 in paperback. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> is running against Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Madigan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>., for the minority whip post vacated by former Rep. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Wyo </LOCATION>., who was sworn in Friday as secretary of

 Four black activists escaped from South African custody today and requested refuge at the West German Embassy in <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>, an embassy official said. Embassy Counselor <PERSON> Klaus </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonnemann </PERSON> said the men, all detainees who had been on hunger strikes, arrived at the embassy this afternoon and said they belong to the banned <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, the country's largest anti-apartheid coalition. The men said they escaped from <LOCATION> Hillbrow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, where they were being treated for fasting to protest their detention without trial, <PERSON> Bonnemann </PERSON> said. Hundreds of detainees have taken part in hunger strikes since January, demanding they be released or put on trial. <PERSON> Bonnemann </PERSON> declined to say exactly what the men want from the West German Embassy and added no decision had been made concerning them. South African police confirmed four detainees escaped from <LOCATION> Hillbrow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> today, but declined to give any additional details. In <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, the West German <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said the four men were in `` administrative custody.'' Spokesman <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumacher </PERSON> indicated he did not know precisely what the men were seeking. The West German Embassy did not release the names of the men, but human rights lawyer <PERSON> Azhar </PERSON> <PERSON> Cachalia </PERSON> identified them as <PERSON> Job </PERSON> <PERSON> Sithole </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ephraim </PERSON> <PERSON> Nkoe </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mpho </PERSON> <PERSON> Legoro </PERSON> and <PERSON> Clive </PERSON> <PERSON> Radebe </PERSON>. <PERSON> Cachalia </PERSON> declined to say how the men left the hospital and traveled to the West German Embassy. <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> is about 40 miles from <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. Journalists were not allowed inside the embassy this afternoon, but from the street, the four black men could be seen standing in the foyer of the building, clad in T-shirts and jeans. People have escaped from South African custody and taken refuge in foreign diplomatic missions several times in recent years. Most recently, three detainees escaped from a hospital in September and holed up in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Consulate in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> for more than 40 days before deciding to leave. The South African government promised that the three men, all <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> members, would not be detained or restricted once they left the consulate. The three have regularly spoken on behalf of the front in recent months. In another incident, <PERSON> Klaas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Jonge </PERSON>, a Dutch citizen accused of smuggling weapons for the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla movement, took refuge in the Dutch Consulate in <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> for more than two years before he was returned to the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> in September 1987 in an exchange involving in four countries.

 Journalists were harassed by gunfire from an army helicopter as they rushed a fatally wounded Dutch television cameraman to the hospital after a firefight, the reporters said. It seemed as if soldiers in the helicopter were `` playing a game'' by firing ahead of and behind the journalists' car, said producer <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Elenbaas </PERSON>, who was among those trying to save his co-worker, <PERSON> Cornel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lagrouw </PERSON>. The military said it regretted the deaths of <LOCATION> Lagrouw </LOCATION> and of two <LOCATION> Salvadoran </LOCATION> journalists killed in separate incidents while covering the presidential vote. It said a soldier was arrested in one of the slayings. The deaths brought to 15 the number of foreign and <LOCATION> Salvadoran </LOCATION> journalists killed covering the nine-year civil war. <PERSON> Lagrouw </PERSON>, 30, of the Dutch television church network <ORGANIZATION> IKON </ORGANIZATION>, was shot Sunday during a clash between army troops and leftist guerrillas in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <PERSON> Javier </PERSON>, a town about 70 miles east of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. He was standing next to guerrillas when he was struck in the chest by a bullet fired from an army position as troops moved in to take back the town, said journalists who were with him. `` He was pale but still alive,'' said photographer <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Gentile </PERSON> of Newsweek who, with <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Robles </PERSON> of JB Photos and free-lance newsman <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON>, pulled Lagrouw out of the area and into a car to rush him to a hospital. `` I was cradling him. He was dying in my arms,'' <PERSON> Gentile </PERSON> said. `` We're not sure when <PERSON> Cornel </PERSON> died _ on the ground or in the car.'' Two cars rushing Lagrouw to the hospital in <LOCATION> Usulutan </LOCATION> came under repeated fire from a helicopter, <PERSON> Gentile </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robles </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Elenbaas </PERSON> told a news conference: `` The moment we were out of the village, the helicopter started pursuing us. It's probable they were playing a game with us. If they had wanted to hit the car, they probably could have hit it.'' <PERSON> Robles </PERSON>, who was in a jeep ahead of the car carrying <PERSON> Lagrouw </PERSON>, said, `` We had signs, and we had four white flags.'' Under established protocol generally respected by both army and guerrillas, reporters and photographers in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> travel in vehicles marked `` Press'' or `` TV'' with white flags affixed to car doors. Dutch Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> den </PERSON> <PERSON> Broek </PERSON> today called <PERSON> Lagrouw </PERSON>'s death an `` extremely regrettable incident. However, he told reporters in <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> that it was an apparent accident and his government was not considering diplomatic steps against <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. The dead Salvadoran journalists were identified as <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Navas </PERSON>, 30, a photographer who worked for the <ORGANIZATION> Reuters </ORGANIZATION> news agency; and <PERSON> Mauricio </PERSON> <PERSON> Pineda </PERSON>, 26, of Channel 12 television in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Galdamez </PERSON>, another <ORGANIZATION> Reuters </ORGANIZATION> photographer, was with <PERSON> Navas </PERSON> on a motorcycle when the two were fired on by soldiers at a checkpoint Saturday night on the outskirts of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Galdamez </PERSON>, who was wounded, told doctors at the <ORGANIZATION> Rosales </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> before emergency surgery that he and <PERSON> Navas </PERSON> were shot without warning. <PERSON> Pineda </PERSON> was with a mobile TV unit traveling to the coastal city of <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, 115 miles from the capital, when a soldier shot at the pickup truck, according to station spokesman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Figueroa </PERSON>. The van was identified as a television vehicle and carried a white flag, <PERSON> Figueroa </PERSON> said. It passed through a checkpoint early Sunday to get to a regional airport and deliver film. On the way back, as it passed the checkpoint in daylight, a soldier fired three shots from behind the vehicle, killing <PERSON> Pineda </PERSON>. Responding to the three killings, the <ORGANIZATION> Salvadoran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correspondents </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement: `` In these three incidents, we note with alarm a tendency on the part of the armed forces that appears aimed at intimidating and frightening the press corps in order to make their work more difficult. Col. <PERSON> Emilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON>, head of the joint chiefs of staff, said the armed forces `` genuinely laments'' the deaths and promised to investigate the slayings and said the corporal who shot <PERSON> Pineda </PERSON> was under arrest. `` Though they happened in a brief lapse, this kind of incident is isolated. It does not represent any policy or desire on the part of the armed forces to intimidate journalists or keep them from doing their job,'' <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON> said. Defense Minister Gen. <PERSON> Eugenio </PERSON> <PERSON> Vides </PERSON> <PERSON> Casanova </PERSON> said <PERSON> Navas </PERSON> and <PERSON> Galdamez </PERSON> did not heed orders to stop at checkpoints. He offered `` condolences and most sincere apologies to their families.'' Four Dutch TV journalists were killed on March 17, 1982, in the northern province of <LOCATION> Chalatenango </LOCATION>. The government said they were slain during a gunbattle between rebels and army troops, but the Dutch government said it had evidence security forces were responsible.

 Ten people criminally convicted for their participation in a 1985 protest demonstration at a <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> abortion clinic lost a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> appeal today. The justices, without comment, refused to hear arguments that the defendants wrongly were barred from asserting medical justification as a defense for their crimes. The appeal also urged that the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> case be used to reverse the high court's 1973 decision legalizing abortion. The justices already have under study an abortion-regulation dispute from <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> in which they are being asked to reverse or limit the 16-year-old ruling in a case called <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>. In the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> case, the 10 were convicted of `` defiant trespass'' and acquitted of all other charges stemming from an Aug. 10, 1985, anti-abortion demonstration at the Northeast Women's Center A state appeals court said the 10 `` pushed their way'' into the clinic and occupied several rooms. `` Once inside, they damaged two aspirator machines and other medical instruments, threw equipment out of a third-floor window and placed ` pro-life' stickers on the doors, walls and ceilings,'' the state court said. After refusing to leave, the 10 protesters were carried away by police officers. Each drew a sentence of one day to three months in jail. A state appeals court upheld the convictions and sentences last May 2, and the <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> refused to hear their appeal last Oct. 20. In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for the 10 protesters said their clients are among `` thousands of law-abiding citizens ... now engaging in heightened demonstrations or ` rescues' at abortion clinics throughout the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' The appeal said that each of the protesters `` knew that his or her conduct would otherwise be criminal except for the defense of justification sought to be interposed in this case.'' The appeal was filed in behalf of <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Markum </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Walton </PERSON>, <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Silcox </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Breen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Tenagolio </PERSON>, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> and <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Gies </PERSON>.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Florida-based company wanting to require all its employees to attend weekly <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> devotional services lost a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> appeal today. The justices, without comment, left intact rulings that the requirement violated the rights of an atheist who worked at the company's plant in <LOCATION> Eloy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>. Lawyers for the company argued that its owners' constitutionally protected religious freedoms were violated `` Unless ... employers -LRB- may -RRB- operate their businesses in accordance with their sincerely held religious beliefs, the private workplace will increasingly become void of religion,'' the appeal contended. J.O. -LRB- <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> -RRB- and <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Townley </PERSON> control and manage the <ORGANIZATION> Townley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Candler </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>. The couple are born-again Christians who said they promised God their mining-equipment manufacturing company `` would be a Christian, faith-operated business.'' The company, founded in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> in 1963, since has opened other plants, including one in <LOCATION> Eloy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>. Employees at <LOCATION> Townley </LOCATION> plants for years were required to attend weekly devotional services <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelvas </PERSON>, identified in court documents as an atheist, began working as a machinist at the <LOCATION> Townley </LOCATION> plant in <LOCATION> Eloy </LOCATION> in 1979. Mandatory attendance at devotional services was not required there until 1984. <PERSON> Pelvas </PERSON> attended several and then asked to be excused because he was an atheist. His supervisor told <PERSON> Pelvas </PERSON> that he had to attend but that he could sleep, read a newspaper or otherwise engage himself durng the services. <PERSON> Pelvas </PERSON> continued to attend the services, which usually lasted 30 to 45 minutes during the work day, but in October 1984 he filed a religious-discrimination complaint with the <ORGANIZATION> federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opportunity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Pelvas </PERSON> left the company two months later, saying he was offered a transfer that amounted to a firing. The commission in 1986 ruled that <PERSON> Townley </PERSON> violated a part of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 barring on-the-job religious discrimination. A federal trial judge in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> barred <PERSON> Townley </PERSON> in May 1987 from continuing mandatory devotional services at the Eloy plant. The 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> upheld the judge's injunction last Oct. 20 The appeals court noted that the federal law imposes a duty on employers to accommodate an employee's religious practices unless doing so would cause undue hardship. The appeals court said <PERSON> Townley </PERSON> had failed to prove any undue hardship in <LOCATION> Pelvas </LOCATION>' case, and rejected the company's argument that it is a `` religious corporation'' <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> intended to exempt from the law. `` The <ORGANIZATION> EEOC </ORGANIZATION> does not seek to enjoin the services altogether; rather it only objects to their mandatory nature,'' the appeals court said. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration urged the court to rule against <PERSON> Townley </PERSON> and its owners. `` Any minor burden on the Townleys' religious practices is justified in this case,'' government lawyers said. The case is <ORGANIZATION> Townley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> vs. <ORGANIZATION> EEOC </ORGANIZATION>, 88-988.

<HEAD>Court Overrules Botha's Decision To Halt Murder Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today overruled South African President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s order to halt the murder trial of six soldiers charged in the stabbing death of a black activist. It marks the second time in four months that <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s highest court has overturned a decision by <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> to grant immunity to soldiers accused of murder in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, also known as <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. A three-judge panel said the soldiers of <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s South African-led army will have to stand trial for the Nov. 30, 1986, killing of <PERSON> Immanuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Shifidi </PERSON>. Those accused are four white officers _ two colonels, a commandant and a lieutenant _ and two black enlisted men, a corporal and a private. <PERSON> Shifidi </PERSON>, 56, was stabbed fatally at a rally outside <LOCATION> Windhoek </LOCATION> staged by the legal political wing of the <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Shifidi </PERSON> was a founding member of the organization, which has fought a 23-year bush war for independence from South African administration. The organization's military wing is outlawed. <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s attorney general has said the soldiers arranged for 54 black soldiers to dress in civilian clothes and disrupt the rally in <LOCATION> Katutura </LOCATION>, a black township outside <LOCATION> Windhoek </LOCATION>, the capital. The six pleaded not guilty to charges of murder and public violence. But before the trial could begin, <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> last March invoked a section of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s Defense Act that empowers him to grant immunity to any soldier for any action committed `` in good faith ... in connection with the prevention or suppression of terrorism in any operational area.'' <PERSON> Harmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruppel </PERSON>, a lawyer representing the <PERSON> Shifidi </PERSON> family, has said there is no evidence <PERSON> Shifidi </PERSON> was a pre-selected target for assassination. He said it appears the soldiers sought to discredit the guerrilla organization and intimidate its supporters by provoking violence at its rally.

<HEAD>Oregon Case to be Used to Test Enforcement of Environmental Law</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today agreed to decide a narrow, but potentially significant, point of environmental law that may affect the effectiveness of enforcement by private citizens. The justices said they will consider reinstating a lawsuit against a <LOCATION> Tillamook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, landfill by the couple who own an adjacent dairy farm. A federal appeals court threw out the 1982 suit because the farm couple failed to notify everyone they were required to under the environmental law they used to sue the county. <PERSON> Olaf </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hallstrom </PERSON> live on a dairy farm near the landfill. Their 1982 suit alleged that contaminated liquid called leachate discharged from the landfill caused or contributed to bacterial and chemical pollution of the surface and ground water on their farm. They contended that the county was violating the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, one of at least a dozen federal environmental laws that gives private citizens the right to sue for enforcement. The Hallstroms notified the county of their intent to sue well before the 60-day period required by the federal law. But they did not, as required by the law, give the same notification to the federal <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> or the <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Quality </ORGANIZATION>. A federal trial judge treated the failure to comply with the notification requirements as a procedural flaw remedied by merely delaying the suit for 60 days. The judge ruled in 1985 that the county had violated the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and ordered the county to remedy the violation within two years. The judge refused to award the Hallstroms $ 95,000 in attorney fees and legal costs. The couple appealed, and the county filed a cross-appeal. The 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled in 1987 that the Hallstroms' lawsuit should have been dismissed because of their failure to notify the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> and the state agency. The appeals court said the failure represented a jurisdictional flaw, not a procedural one. Other federal appeals courts have reached the opposite conclusion. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration urged the justices to use the Hallstroms' appeal to resolve the conflicting appellate court rulings `` The different approaches ... can cause significantly different results,'' government lawyers said. They noted that the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act allows private enforcement lawsuits only if a defendant is allegedly violating the law at that time. `` If a plaintiff's action is dismissed for lack of proper notice, and the defendant promptly comes into compliance with the <ORGANIZATION> RCRA </ORGANIZATION>, the plaintiff may not file his action again,'' the government lawyers said. `` By contrast, if the plaintiff's case were stayed ... the same defendant would remain liable for civil penalties and possibly attorneys' fees.'' The government said the 9th Circuit court ruling was correct. The case is <PERSON> Hallstrom </PERSON> vs. <LOCATION> Tillamook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, 88-42.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today turned away a still-pending, big-money antitrust dispute over the sale of raw milk. The justices, without comment, let stand a federal appeals court ruling that could cost millions for two cooperative associations of dairy farmers and a marketing agent for dairy cooperatives. The case is nearly 18 years old, dating back to a 1971 lawsuit filed by one of the dairy cooperatives who ended up an unsuccessful defendant in a counter-suit. The 8th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in 1982 ruled against <ORGANIZATION> Mid-America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dairymen </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Milk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Producers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Milk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Producers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperative </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. The appeals court said they had engaged in a broad, illegal conspiracy to eliminate competitive sellers of Grade A raw milk in the Midwest. The appeals court ruled that the conspiracy hurt the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a nationwide farm bargaining organization. The 8th Circuit court's 1982 ruling instructed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, to determine what monetary damages <ORGANIZATION> NFO </ORGANIZATION> should collect. In ensuing proceedings before Judge <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NFO </ORGANIZATION> advanced alternative damage measurement theories. It claimed tripled damages of $ 55.4 million under one theory, and tripled damages of $ 22.2 million under the other. The trial judge refused to award any damages. Ruling in the case a second time last July 6, the <ORGANIZATION> 8th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> court </ORGANIZATION> reaffirmed its holding that <ORGANIZATION> NFO </ORGANIZATION> `` incurred substantial damages'' as a result of illegal acts. The appeals court again sent the case back to <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON>, with `` more specific directions ... with respect to the computation of damages.'' The appeals court also said the trial judge should `` determine and award appropriate attorneys fees and costs'' to <ORGANIZATION> NFO </ORGANIZATION>. It said <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> was right in rejecting the theory under which <ORGANIZATION> NFO </ORGANIZATION> said it was entitled to $ 55.4 million. But it said the theory under which <ORGANIZATION> NFO </ORGANIZATION> claimed $ 22.2 million in damages `` is a proper basis for a substantial damage award.'' The cases are <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Milk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Producers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> vs. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, 88-1247, and <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Milk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Producers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> vs. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, 88-1248.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today again refused to let states and state agencies be sued for allegedly violating federal copyright laws. The justices, without comment, refused to revive allegations that <ORGANIZATION> UCLA </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> state-run university, illegally copied a company's computer programs and instruction manuals. The justices on Feb. 21 turned away a similar appeal by a photographer who accused a state university in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> of unauthorized use of his photographs. In the case acted on today, BV Engineering's appeal was supported by numerous members of the artistic, entertainment and literary community. Nine major motion picture studios urged the court to hear BV Engineering's appeal to broaden protection against what they said is widespread copyright infringement. The movie producers said, for example, that prisons in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> are refusing to pay for films shown to inmates. BV Engineering sued <ORGANIZATION> UCLA </ORGANIZATION> in 1986, accusing the university of illegally copying seven computer programs and the accompanying user manuals. The suit was thrown out by a federal judge, and the 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled last October that states and state agencies are immune from copyright-infringement suits. The appeals court said states are protected by the Constitution's 11th Amendment, which shields them from a variety of lawsuits The appeals court, citing previous <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rulings, said the federal Copyright Act of 1976 does not explicitly remove _ or abrogate _ the 11th Amendment protection. `` We are constrained by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s mandate that we find an abrogation of 11th Amendment immunity only when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has included in the statute unequivocal and specific language indicating an intent to subject states to suit in federal court,'' the 9th Circuit court said. `` We recognize that our holding will allow states to violate the federal copyright laws with virtual impunity,'' the appeals court continued. `` It is for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, however, to remedy this problem.'' BV Engineering said it was left without a remedy since federal copyright law bars the company from suing <ORGANIZATION> UCLA </ORGANIZATION> in state court in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. The case is BV Engineering vs. <ORGANIZATION> UCLA </ORGANIZATION>, 88-1099.

 An <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> employee who, under a cloak of anonymity, accused the agency of not telling people who neglect to subtract withholding when figuring their taxes went public on network television today and was promised protection by Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> `` If they try any kind of reprisal, they better watch out'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, D-Tenn., said of <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> officials The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> employee, <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a return examiner in the agency's service center in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, appeared with <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Today'' show She had planned to appear in silhouette and with her voice disguised, but dropped those precautions because `` I found out that it's probabaly known out there ... who has actually reported it,'' she said. Ms. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> originally told her story during a private meeting with <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>. She repeated it in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> last week, but insisted that she not be identifed at the time because of fear of retaliation. She is involved in the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION>'s program to detect taxpayers who fail to report some or all their taxable income. About 15 months after tax returns are filed, computers match returns with Form 1099s, W-2s and other source-of-income reports and if some income does not show up on a return, examiners such as Ms. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> decide whether the taxpayer should be sent a letter demanding an explanation. In 1987, while checking 1985 returns, Ms. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said, she and colleagues found numerous returns on which filers had failed to subtract withheld taxes from taxes owed. That meant the taxpayers were overpaying. When she went to supervisors, she said, they told her <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> policy required taxpayers to find their own mistakes. After protests, she added, her superiors checked with <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and were told to abide by the policy. `` It was stealing from the taxpayers,'' Ms. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. She said the disputed policy was changed last year to allow <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> employees to notify taxpayers when they fail to subtract taxes that have been withheld from wages or periodic pension payments. But the old policy still stands for taxpayers who neglect to subtract taxes withheld from lump-sum pension payments. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> has steadfastly refused to comment directly on Ms. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s assertions, saying it is reviewing its employee manual and policies. However, in an appearance before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> oversight subcommittee last week, acting <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said `` it is possible that taxpayers did not get the refund they were entitled to.'' Even after changes were made last December, <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said, `` I still am not completely satisfied with that program.''

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Bar Oklahoma Prosecutors From Forcing Removal of

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today refused to bar <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> prosecutors who seek incriminating evidence from forcing the surgical removal of a bullet from a murder suspect's arm. The court, without comment, turned down <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>' arguments that removing the bullet would violate his constitutional protection against unreasonable searches and seizures The <ORGANIZATION> Oklahoma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, by a 2-1 vote last Oct. 27, ruled that the surgery could be peformed against <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>' will. The operation has not yet taken place. Andrews is charged with first-degree murder in the March 3, 1988, shooting death of <PERSON> Hatten </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Ledford </PERSON> in rural <LOCATION> McClain </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. Before he died, <PERSON> Ledford </PERSON> told someone he thought he had wounded the man who shot him, whom he identified as <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Miser </PERSON>. <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> was found, suffering from a gunshot wound, about 750 feet from <PERSON> Ledford </PERSON>'s home. A state judge approved county prosecutors' request to compel surgical removal of the bullet lodged in Andrews' upper arm. The state appeals court, in upholding that ruling, noted a doctor's testimony for prosecutors that removal of the bullet would not be life-threatening, and would require only a local anesthetic. `` The extent of the surgical intrusion upon the defendant's protective interests, privacy ... personal dignity and body integrity is not impermissibly significant,'' the state appeals court ruled In the appeal acted on today, <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> argued that the <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> court's decision conflicts with what the justices ruled in a <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> case four years ago. In the 1985 decision, the high court refused to let <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> law enforcement officials force the surgical removal of a bullet from a criminal suspect's chest. `` A compelled surgical intrusion into an individual's body for evidence ... implicates expectations of privacy and security of such magnitude that the intrusion may be unreasonable even if likely to produce evidence of a crime,'' the court said in the 1985 case. The justices in that decision drew a distinction between the surgical removal of a bullet and the taking, over a suspect's protest, of a blood sample to establish intoxication The court allowed such takings of blood samples in a 1966 ruling. The <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> court, distinguishing <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>' case from the 1985 decision, said the surgery required in the <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> case was riskier. The case is Andrews vs. Love, 88-1296.

 A newspaper photographer convicted for pursuing a police chase and photographing a suspect's arrest in <LOCATION> Troy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, three years ago lost a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> appeal today. The court, without comment, left intact <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>'s conviction on charges of obstructing police work <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>, also convicted of reckless driving in connection with the May 6, 1986, incident, was sentenced to five days in jail and fined $ 400. His appeal did not challenge the reckless-driving conviction. But the appeal attacked a Troy city ordinance that states no one `` shall obstruct, resist, hinder or oppose'' any police officer's duties <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>'s lawyers said the ordinance, when invoked against him, violated free-press rights. They also argued that the ordinance should be struck down because `` it places unfettered enforcement discretion in the hands of the police.'' <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>, then working as an intern photographer for The <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, was driving along <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> 75 when he heard on his radio that a nearby police car was pursuing a car that had rammed it. <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> pulled onto the highway shoulder and waited until he saw a state police car chasing another car. He then followed, driving up to 80 miles an hour to stay right behind the state trooper's car. When the suspect's car came to a stop, the state trooper stopped his patrol car right behind it, jumped out and drew his gun. Troy police also had guns drawn and pointed at the suspect. <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> photographed the tense scene, from what his lawyers said was about 10 feet away. But lawyers for the city told the justices that <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> was as close at 18 inches to the suspect, and that he refused to get out of the way when ordered to do so by police. <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> no longer lives in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, his lawyer said, but still works as a newspaper photographer. He has not yet completed the 5-day sentence, or paid the $ 400 fine. The case is <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> vs. Troy, 88-1212.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today rejected an appeal by workers at a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> nuclear power plant who are challenging their employer's random drug tests. The court, without comment, left intact a ruling that threw out, at least temporarily, a lawsuit attacking the tests. The justices already are studying the validity of drug tests in three other cases, one involving a private employer and two concerning federal workers or federal regulations. The case acted on today stems from tests initiated by <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> at its <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Onofre </LOCATION> nuclear plant. The tests, modified in December 1986, require randomly selected workers to produce urine samples for laboratory analysis. The workers are told the day before they are tested. The plan was challenged by Local 246 of the <ORGANIZATION> Utility </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. The union said the tests violate the collective bargaining agreement between the workers and the utility, and also violate provisions of the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Constitution protecting privacy and freedom from unreasonable searches and seizure. The union's lawsuit was filed in state court and transferred to a federal court at the request of <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION>. A federal judge in 1987 temporarily blocked the tests pending resolution of a grievance filed by the union. But the 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> overturned the judge's injunction, and also ruled that the lawsuit was preempted by federal labor law The appeals court said the federal Labor Management Relations Act governing worker-employer disputes bars the nuclear plant workers from filing a suit now claiming their rights guaranteed by the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Constitution were violated. `` Drug testing does not implicate the sort of non-negotiable state-law rights'' that would allow the suit to be decided in court before it is determined whether the tests violate the workers' collective bargaining agreement, the appeals court said The appeals court said the next step for the union is to submit the case to arbitration to decide whether the contract was violated because the utility unilaterally adopted the tests. The appeals court did not rule out the possibility that Local 246 could return to the courts if it loses in arbitration. The union said it should be entitled now to a ruling on whether the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Constitution protects workers against random drug tests. The case is <ORGANIZATION> Utility </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION>, 88-1180.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today refused to hear an appeal by a federal judge in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> who issued orders in a bankruptcy case after he disqualified himself from presiding over the matter. The court, without comment, left intact a ruling that set aside the judge's orders. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> announced in his courtroom on Jan 29, 1988, that he was disqualifying himself from a case involving the <ORGANIZATION> Jeannette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> glass company because of the appearance of a conflict of interest. <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> disclosed that his daughter worked for <ORGANIZATION> Mellon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, a creditor of <ORGANIZATION> Jeannette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The judge then continued to preside over a hearing that lasted more than six hours. On March 16, 1988, <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> granted a request to convert <PERSON> Jeannette </PERSON>'s bankruptcy petition from one aimed at reorganizing the corporation to one dissolving it. <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> also sharply criticized two lawyers involved in the case, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cindrich </PERSON> and <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>. He accused them of `` trying to rip off this estate in millions of dollars.'' The lawyers said <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>' announcement of his orders in the case were a `` ` press conference'' to which reporters had been summoned by the judge's secretary. The attorneys also said there was no basis to <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>' accusations against them. The 3rd U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled last September that <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> should have stepped aside immediately after announcing there was a potential conflict of interest. `` Once a judge has disqualified himself, he or she may enter no further orders in the case,'' the appeals court said in ordering the bankruptcy matter assigned to a different judge. The appeals court also urged <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>, `` in light of the animosity that appears to have arisen'' between himself and the two lawyers, to consider never again presiding over any matter involving their firms. The appeals court also said the way <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> announced his orders at the March 16 proceeding appeared to `` highly inappropriate.'' The case is <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>, 88-1174.

<TEXT>
 Two women active in fighting pornography today lost <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> attempts to revive libel lawsuits against Hustler magazine and its publisher, <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynt </PERSON>. The court, without comment, let stand rulings that 1985 articles villifying each woman in pornographic terms are constitutionally protected expressions of opinion. <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ault </PERSON>, who founded an anti-pornography group in <LOCATION> Milwaukie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Dorchen </PERSON> <PERSON> Leidholdt </PERSON>, a New Yorker who helped found Women Against Pornography, were the targets of a column published each month in Hustler. The column, which frequently elicits libel suits from its subjects, singles out people who oppose the sexually explicit magazine's views. Carrying an epithet as its title, the column usually engages in personal attacks as well as criticizing its targets' views. Ms. <PERSON> Ault </PERSON> was the column's target in the magazine's April 1985 issue; Ms. <PERSON> Leidholdt </PERSON> in the June 1985 edition. Some of the gentler terms used to describe Ms. <PERSON> Ault </PERSON> included `` fanatic,'' `` crackpot,'' `` threatened by sex'' and `` deluded busybody.'' Ms. <PERSON> Leidholdt </PERSON>'s lawsuit charged that the June 1985 column falsely described her as `` sexually repressed,'' a person who hates men and herself and suffers from `` bizarre paranoia,'' `` vengeful hysteria,'' and `` demented thinking.'' Ms. <PERSON> Ault </PERSON> sued in federal court in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>; Ms. <PERSON> Leidholdt </PERSON> in federal court in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>. Both suits were dismissed by a trial judge before they reached a jury, and the 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> upheld the dismissals last October. In Ms. <PERSON> Ault </PERSON>'s case, the appeals court said, `` We think it clear that there is a heated and spirited debate on pornography of which this article is a part, in which epithets, fiery rhetoric and hyperbole are expected.'' The appeals court added, `` It is unfortunate that the legal category of opinion must be used to describe a statement that is no more than a vicious slur but base and malignant speech is not necessarily actionable -LRB- libel -RRB-.'' In the appeals acted on today, lawyers for both women argued that the <ORGANIZATION> 9th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> court rulings unduly expanded the concept of legally protected expressions of opinion. `` What public debate is furthered by this type of assault on personal dignity?'' one appeal asked. `` Elevation of such conduct to the pedestal of protected speech should not be tolerated.'' But lawyers for <PERSON> Flynt </PERSON> and his magazine, in urging that the appeals be rejected, argued that the Constitution protects even `` vituperative, pejorative or pernicious opinion.'' The cases are <PERSON> Leidholdt </PERSON> vs. L.F.P. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, 88-1214, and <ORGANIZATION> Ault </ORGANIZATION> v. <ORGANIZATION> Hustler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magazine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, 88-1215.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today refused to revive a libel lawsuit against the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> by a <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> commander court-martialed in 1984 after his ship ran aground in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. The justices, citing a lack of jurisdiction, left intact <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> court decisions dismissing Cmdr. <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> -LRB- Bud -RRB- <PERSON> Chrisman </PERSON>'s suit that alleged seven Times articles ruined his Naval career. The state courts cited <PERSON> Chrisman </PERSON>'s failure to request a correction or retraction, a requirement under state libel law, and the legal protection given to fair and accurate reports of governmental proceedings. The first sued-over article reported allegations that <PERSON> Chrisman </PERSON> had been intoxicated when his ship, the San Diego-based <LOCATION> USS </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Thomaston </LOCATION>, ran aground in <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Allen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kauai </LOCATION>, on Jan. 24, 1984. The second article reported that the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> had decided to court-martial <PERSON> Chrisman </PERSON> on charges stemming from the grounding. The last five articles reported on each day of the court-martial, concluding with a report that <PERSON> Chrisman </PERSON> had been convicted of negligently hazarding his ship but acquitted of charges that he was drunk at the time. A state trial judge refused to dismiss <PERSON> Chrisman </PERSON>'s suit against the Times, but an appeals court later ordered that the case be thrown out. The <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> refused to hear <PERSON> Chrisman </PERSON>'s appeal last July 28. In the appeal acted on today, <PERSON> Chrisman </PERSON> argued that the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> retraction law should not have been invoked in his case because the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> articles had been published with `` actual malice.'' The appeal also contended that the articles reporting his court-martial `` were neither true or fair because the testimony was incorrectly or falsely summarized.'' <PERSON> Chrisman </PERSON> said the state court rulings `` unconstitutionally extend the scope of the ` neutral reportage' privilege, and literary license doctrine ... so as to deprive -LRB- him -RRB- of the right to protect his reputation from defamatory statements.'' Lawyers for the newspaper urged the justices to reject <PERSON> Chrisman </PERSON>'s appeal The case is <PERSON> Chrisman </PERSON> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, 88-844.

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Let Idaho Officials Tax Income of Some Railway Workers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today refused to let <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> officials tax the income of railway workers who live elsewhere but pass through the state as crew members on non-stop freight trains. The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that such a tax would violate the Constitution and be unfair to the workers. The <ORGANIZATION> Idaho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled last May that <ORGANIZATION> Burlington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> crews working on trains traveling between <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Whitefish </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Missoula </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, may not be forced to pay the tax. The trains cross <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>'s panhandle without making any scheduled stops in the state. <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> officials in 1983 ordered the railway workers to pay taxes on income received from 1978 through 1982. The state sought to impose the tax on a portion of the workers' income state officials said was earned while in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. The state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said, `` <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> is not the source of this income since there is no contribution by <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> to the production of this income. It would be unfair to allow the state to impose a tax on the income of the train crews earned while they are merely passing through <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>.'' The state court said the tax violates the Constitution by interfering with interstate commerce and by denying the workers due process protection. The state court added that the workers' wages while passing through <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> `` are not attributable to any economic activity within <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> markets and commerce do not affect their income in any degree.'' The state court relied largely on <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rulings holding that the test for the constitutionality of a state tax affecting out-of-state residents is `` whether the state has given anything for which it can ask return.'' The state Court said while the state has given something of value to <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION>, it `` has not given anything to the train crews for which it can ask return.'' In the appeal acted on today, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> officials said the state court ruling `` sets a dangerous and disruptive precedent'' and conflicts with decisions by other courts giving states sweeping power to tax non-residents who work within those states. `` Taxpayers in other jurisdictions are now lining up to challenge taxation of non-residents based on <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>'s decision,'' the state's appeal said The case is <ORGANIZATION> Idaho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> vs. Blangers, 88-1266.

 Republicans in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> are like a losing team in search of a new manager _ do they want someone who'll stress fundamentals and building for the future, or a scrapper who promises an all-out assault with the weapons at hand? That's the issue as <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Republicans try to decide on a successor to <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>, the new secretary of defense who vacated the job of minority whip, the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION>'s second highest post in the chamber. Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Madigan </PERSON>, 53, of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> is the solid, steady lawmaker who makes few headlines but has climbed to stature within the hallways of <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. Rep. <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, 45, of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> is the ideological rabble-rouser who brashly describes himself as `` a national leader who serves in the House.'' The clear choice between two styles and directions is being presented this week to a Republican group that is itself torn. The <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION>'s usual posture of working with the ruling Democrats to win what it can has lost favor with some Republicans who want to lash out in frustration after more than three decades as the minority party. The decision could color the proceedings of the House for some time to come. The winner of the race will become the heir apparent to House Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>., who is expected to retire in the next few years `` It is a kind of a watershed,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Frenzel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Minn </LOCATION>. Outside of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> is by far the better known of the two candidates The leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opportunity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> ca n't keep away from the television cameras and, like his nemesis, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, has a penchant for hyperbole that leaps into print. `` I bring to the office of whip a national network, national issues, national resources, personal ties to -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, personal ties to the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> presidential campaign, personal ties to the executive branch ...'' he said, touting his qualifications at a news conference last Friday. <PERSON> Madigan </PERSON> is what the party wants if `` it would prefer to remain in the minority,'' <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> said. `` I am deeply committed to ending the 36-year Democratic monopoly of power in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. It was <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> who made the official complaint that launched the current <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee probe of the Democratic Speaker, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, a move that many on both sides of the aisle at first considered too daring, too much rocking the boat. Part of that complaint involved an favorable deal under which the speaker published and sold a compilation of personal reflections. A published report today showed that <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> also had an unusual book arrangement, with political allies forming a limited partnership to pay for promoting a book <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> co-wrote. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> argues he is cut out for being the minority whip, a job of head counting, head bashing and organization. He cites his fight in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to get Republicans more staff slots in the House. He says his election as whip also would mean `` integrating ... the process of legislation and the process of national opinion. That's a totally different race than the normal whip race.'' It would be a handy cliche to say that <PERSON> Madigan </PERSON> `` bristles'' at <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>'s suggestion that he's the choice of the status quo, <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> minority, but he does n't. He calls no press conferences. In an interview, he calmly tries to refute <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>'s portrayal of the race and makes clear that he's talking only about a different kind of hardball. `` There are no content Republicans. All Republicans want to be in the majority,'' he said. `` And we are an odds-on bet to do that in 1992 without respect to who is elected whip,'' because of reapportionment and party strength, he said. <PERSON> Madigan </PERSON>, the current deputy whip and a senior member of the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> committees, has been conducting a low-key campaign `` based on my demeanor, and experience, and legislative accomplishments.'' `` I love this institution. I want it to be occupied by a Republican majority. I do not want it destroyed.'' The last is a clear reference to <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>'s willingness to employ radical tactics, but <PERSON> Madigan </PERSON> denies it. `` I'm not saying anything about Mr. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, his campaign, or anything that he says,'' he said. To <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, the Democratic majority is a corrupt dictatorship. He's even compared his feelings toward Speaker <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> to his feelings toward convicted murderers. <PERSON> Madigan </PERSON> is more sympathetic. `` The Democrats are as frustrated as the Republicans and are no more effective as a majority than we are as a minority,'' he said. `` I think they relieve their frustrations by crapping on Republicans and think that that's some kind of accomplishment, when it's no accomplishment at all. `` I just feel that somebody needs to challenge them to a higher standard of behavior and productivity,'' he said. The Republican election is expected to take place at a party conference next Wednesday. There are just 174 qualified voters, and it's hard to predict who'll come out on top. And there's a potential wild card _ Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, a popular conservative who declined to run but has left himself open for a draft movement announced by Rep. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION> On Friday, both <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> and <PERSON> Madigan </PERSON> said they were about to go over the top in commitments _ predictions close watchers of the race took with a grain of salt. `` With those numbers, we're now a majority party,'' quipped a top House GOP aide.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said today that he's pleased by management reforms at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and said he believes it is `` on the right track'' toward securing greater influence in world affairs. Speaking at a swearing-in ceremony for <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON>, the new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said `` I take the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> very seriously and I am pleased with the changes that have been taking place there.'' In the first days of his presidency, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> invited <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> to a private White House dinner in a meeting that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aides said was aimed at conveying the new administration's support for the world body.

In his remarks today, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who served as <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> ambassador during the <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> administration, said he wants <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON> to put the spotlight on the human rights situation in communist <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> as he takes up his post. `` The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> is on the right track toward reform and is not a more effective organization,'' the president said. He praised <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON>, 67, as a `` skilled diplomat, a veteran of high-priority, tough assignments.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also said that `` there was a time when a lot of us got a little pessimistic about the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION>'s peacekeeping role,'' but said that the body's performance has improved vastly in recent times, including its mediating role in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, the Iran-Iraq war and the <LOCATION> Angola-Namibia </LOCATION> conflict. <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON>, after taking the oath of office from Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, joked that he and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Lilly </PERSON>, the new ambassador to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, might find themselves working under close scrutiny by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who he said `` knows more about our jobs than we do.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> headed the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liaison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> in 1974-75. `` I will be on my toes in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON>, who previously held ambassadorial posts in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON> succeeds <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> in the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> post.

 Government troops clashed with communist rebels on the southern island of <LOCATION> Mindanao </LOCATION>, killing at least 16 people and wounding scores of others in two separate incidents, the military said today. A military report said government troops killed at least 10 guerrillas and wounded an undetermined number of others during a battle Sunday in a remote, hilly area north of <LOCATION> Davao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, 610 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>.

 More than 3,500 public pay telephones located on federal government property controlled by the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> will remain under license to local <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> companies and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> GSA </ORGANIZATION> said today. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON>, acting <ORGANIZATION> GSA </ORGANIZATION> administrator, said the decision was preliminary until <ORGANIZATION> GSA </ORGANIZATION> conducts a further analysis about licensing a pay phone company. He said the <ORGANIZATION> GSA </ORGANIZATION>'s decision would not prevent the agency from selecting a long-distance carrier other than <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T or pay phone companies other than the <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> companies at a future date. <ORGANIZATION> GSA </ORGANIZATION>'s decision was in response to an order in October by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> under which the owners of premises where <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> pay phones are located must decide by April 1 which long-distance carriers to use. If they do n't make a choice, they will be assigned to a long-distance carrier by lottery. <PERSON> Greene </PERSON>'s order was part of his supervision of the breakup of <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T in 1984. <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T now has a monopoly on long-distance calls from <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> pay telephones, and <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> said other companies should get a chance to compete for the $ 2 billion in long-distance revenues generated each year from the nation's 1.5 million pay phones. The calls in question are those made by dialing `` 0'' plus the long-distance number and either using an operator to charge the call to a home phone, to make it a collect call or use a credit card. Long-distance carriers pay commissions to the businesses where the pay phones are located. <ORGANIZATION> GSA </ORGANIZATION> said it received $ 399,156 in such commissions in 1988. It said it expects to receive about $ 663,000 for the federal treasury this year because of increases in the commission rate.

<HEAD>Court Will Use New Jersey Case to Decide Age Discrimination Issue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today agreed to use a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> case to decide whether federal courts may make it easier to broaden age discrimination lawsuits against employers. The court said it will hear an appeal by <ORGANIZATION> Hoffmann-La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which is accused of bias against older workers in laying off some 1,200 employees at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> plants. The company dismissed the employees on Feb. 4, 1985. A group of older workers, who called the day `` Black Monday'' for many veteran <PERSON> Hoffmann-La </PERSON> <PERSON> Roche </PERSON> workers, said a disproportionately high number of those laid off was over age 40. The group filed a federal lawsuit, charging the company with violating the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act. The group's leaders then sought to contact all fired <PERSON> Hoffmann-La </PERSON> <PERSON> Roche </PERSON> employees over 40 eligible to join the so-called class-action lawsuit. Some 400 employees agreed to join. But the leaders of the court battle against the company said they believed there may be 200 additional fired workers who are members of the class allegedly victimized by age discrimination. The leaders sought to contact the potentially missing workers by direct-mail and notices posted at <PERSON> Hoffmann-La </PERSON> <PERSON> Roche </PERSON> plants. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON> authorized the employees' group, once the missing workers are found, to provide them with an explanation of the suit and a form that would allow them to join the suit <PERSON> Hoffmann-La </PERSON> <PERSON> Roche </PERSON> officials appealed the ruling, arguing that <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON> exceeded his authority. But the 3rd U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> upheld the judge's decision. `` There is no legal impediment to court-authorized notice in an appropriate case'' where those who have filed a class-action suit are seeking other potential plaintiffs, the appeals court said. `` We assume that the district courts will exercise caution that notices approved by the courts will not give the erroneous impression that maintenance of the action has a judicial imprimatur of approval.'' An increased number of plaintiffs in such suits can be a big advantage because it spreads out the court costs. In seeking workers to join the suit, the leaders of the court fight asked for _ but did not require _ a $ 200 contribution to help defray the costs. In appealing to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Hoffman-La </PERSON> <PERSON> Roche </PERSON> officials noted that federal appeals courts elsewhere have disagreed with the 3rd Circuit court decision. The officials urged the high court to clear up the confusion. The case is <PERSON> Hoffmann-La </PERSON> <PERSON> Roche </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Sperling </PERSON>, 88-1203.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s parliament ratified a $ 140 billion budget today after 12 days of debate, <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio reported. It said the budget also was approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Guardian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, which vets all parliamentary bills to determine whether they comply with the fundamentalist state's Islamic religion and constitution. The council made some amendments and dropped unidentified items from the budget, according to the radio report monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>. It did not detail changes. Earlier this month, the <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported parliament had approved in principle a $ 123.7 billion budget. Neither <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> nor the radio explained the higher figure announced today. Since the Aug. 20 cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war, <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> has said its priority is rehabilitating sectors of the economy destroyed by the eight-year war. On Saturday, parliament gave the state's <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> permission to borrow up to $ 1 billion for electricity generation, provided repayment of the loan does not exceed $ 150 million a year, <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio reported. It did not say where the bank might borrow the money. Oil Minister <PERSON> Gholamreza </PERSON> <PERSON> Aqazadeh </PERSON> has said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> would resume borrowing abroad, reversing its longstanding policy of eschewing foreign loans. But the new policy was rejected by hard-liners such as <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Montazeri </PERSON>, designated successor of <LOCATION> Iranian </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>. `` If we start thinking about foreign borrowing, it would mean selling the country to foreigners,'' <PERSON> Montazeri </PERSON> said. Parliament's decision to approve borrowing was seen as indicating concern about the size of the budget deficit.

 A cargo door has become the focus of an investigation into the crash of a civilian plane that crashed while carrying military cargo, killing both crew members. The DC-9 crashed shortly after takeoff Saturday seven miles northwest of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Carswell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>. The plane's wreckage was concentrated in a small area and parts were buried deep in the ground, indicating that it fell at a steep angle, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Benzen </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> investigator. <PERSON> Benzen </PERSON> said the crew reported an emergency and a problem with a cargo door shortly before the crash. `` That is a focus of the investigation, but we're still keeping our eyes wide open,'' <PERSON> Benzen </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Worth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star-Telegram </ORGANIZATION>. `` Structural engineers are looking at parts of that door now and at this juncture, it's not telling us what we want. It needs more study.'' The jet's flight data recorder was recovered Saturday. The cockpit voice recorder was sent to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for analysis Sunday. `` The flight data recorder was battered and very damaged, but we are very sure the magnetic tape inside was intact,'' <PERSON> Benzen </PERSON> said. `` The cockpit voice recorder was very burned, with components melted out of it, but the magnetic recording tape is shielded against such heat, we hope, and hopefully it will tell us something.'' The plane, built in 1968, was owned by Oregon-based <ORGANIZATION> Evergreen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> and was en route from <PERSON> Carswell </PERSON> to Tinker Air Force Base near <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, on a routine cargo flight for the military, a company spokeswoman said.

Inspector <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayronne </PERSON> said the device contained a pound of explosive powder.

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> today opened a conference of 1,100 visiting Jews by saying <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> needs peace but rejected talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> or creation of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state. As <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s conference on solidarity with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> began, an aide to Finance Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> broke ranks with <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> and called for talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. Deputy Finance Minister <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Beilin </PERSON>, who spoke on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio, urged the left-of-center <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> led by <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> to open talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> even if <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> and his right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc disagree. `` I think it's time to say, dear friends, the emperor is naked,'' <PERSON> Beilin </PERSON> said. In the occupied territories, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers shot and wounded a 20-year-old Palestinian protester in the thigh, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. About 330,000 Palestinians in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> were kept indoors by curfew restrictions imposed as merchants launched a three-day general strike to protest seven Palestinian fatalities in clashes with the Israelis over the weekend. Four of the deaths were Sunday, bringing the death toll in the 15-month Palestinian uprising to 403 Arabs. Seventeen Israelis have also died, including six soldiers. Israeli news reports said some leading Jewish personalities declined to attend <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s conference, attended by Jews from 30 countries. The Haaretz daily listed among the absentees <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> stars including <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Streisand </PERSON>, who reportedly gave non-political reasons for staying away. Critics complain the three-day conference aims to boost support for <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s hard-line policies before his <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> visit next month. However, <PERSON> Jewish </PERSON> leaders at the conference were cautious about endorsing <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s policies. `` We are not here to support specific peace proposals,'' <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> <PERSON> Reich </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presidents </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Major </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organizations </ORGANIZATION>, told reporters. In his keynote speech, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> restated positions he is expected to bring to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, offering the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> `` a maximum degree of self-rule that is consistent with our security.'' `` We fully recognize that the status quo is not in our interest, because it means absence of peace, and peace is our paramount goal,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said in the speech closed to the press but later distributed to reporters. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> reiterated his reasons for refusing to talk to the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> or withdraw from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, which it seized from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in the 1967 Middle East War. `` We are opposed to negotiations with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> because it will inevitably lead to a demand for a -LRB- Palestinian -RRB- state west of the <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>,'' he said. He referred to `` the strategic dangers and vulnerability of our eastern borders.'' The <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leader also voiced veiled criticism of Jewish leaders abroad who have met with <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leaders. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> suggested today he is willing to talk to <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> supporters in the occupied territories if they prove they are non-violent. Asked his conditions for negotiating with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, he said: `` We want to negotiate with people who reside in the territories. ... We will not censor their minds.'' The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government agreed to talk directly with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> after leader <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> renounced terrorism in December.

 An offshore oil drilling platform burned early today after explosions on it and an adjacent rig injured at least 10 crewmen and left seven missing, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said. A helicopter and more than a dozen boats searched the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> for the missing men. About 30 people were rescued from the burning rigs and surrounding water, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Richfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Flames on the second rig, connected to the burning one by a catwalk, were extinguished a few hours after they started Sunday evening, said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Robling </PERSON> The rigs were in an area just off the southeast tip of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and near the mouth of the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, about 70 miles from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, known as the <ORGANIZATION> ARCO </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Block </ORGANIZATION> 60, said company spokesman <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. Five of the missing men work for <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Richfield </LOCATION>, which operated the rigs, and two are contractors, said <PERSON> Sims </PERSON>. Coast Guard Petty Officer <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Morehead </PERSON> said an oil slick two miles long and about 100 yards wide extended from the rigs. He said at least four oil crew boats were reportedly attempting to extinguish the blaze. <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> said determining exactly how many people were on the rigs at the time of the fires would be difficult because there are about 10 rigs within several miles of each other in the area and workers sometimes move from rig to rig during an assignment. `` It would be like trying to tell how many people are in a building at one time,'' he said. The cause of the explosions has not been determined but will be investigated by the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said. `` I just do n't know of any specific operations at the time of the explosion that would have caused this,'' <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> said. `` The damage is extensive.'' Ten of the injured were taken to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Marrero </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> suburb. Eight of them were burned, including two who were in critical condition; and the other two suffered multiple injuries, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dutcher </PERSON>. Coast Guard Petty Officer <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Morehead </PERSON> said 13 injuries were confirmed but he did not know where the other three men were taken for treatment. <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> said he knew of only 10 injured crewmen, the ones at <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. Cmdr. <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Donohoe </PERSON>, pilot of one of the helicopters which took some of the injured to the hospital, said when he left the area flames were still shooting high from one rig. `` It looked like the entire rig would be down to the waterline by tomorrow,'' he said Sunday. `` One crewboat was shooting water, trying to put the fire out, but it probably wo n't help much,'' he said. `` It could n't get very close.'' He said he landed on one of the other oil platforms in the immediate area, where crewboats were taking the injured and others, including some who apparently jumped into the water.

Shells fell on at least 10 residential neighborhoods on both sides of the frontline in <LOCATION> Souk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> el-Gharb </LOCATION>, the spokesman said. He said shells also hit the Christian ports of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jounieh </LOCATION> and the airport highway in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The airport has been closed since March 11. The clashes pitted predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> units of army commander Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> against Syrian-backed fighters of Druse warlord <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> militia. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> also leads a <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> that rivals a Moslem Cabinet in this divided nation. Mediation efforts to broker a settlement in the new flare-up of fighting have been deadlocked.

 Designer <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Lagerfeld </PERSON> gave a leggy, saucy look to <ORGANIZATION> Chanel </ORGANIZATION>'s ready-to-wear winter collection in his Monday show. It looked a bit dated, somehow, like a black-and-white photograph of the 1960s, or from his previous show for the Lagerfeld label. As the Beatles' song `` Help'' played on, the Chanel models in miniskirts or cat-suits with very long jackets smacked of Twiggy and Co.. <LOCATION> Lagerfeld </LOCATION> is a talented designer, but perhaps too much is expected of him His Chanel show repeated many of his themes from earlier in the week, such as ribbed tights with tiny tunic skirts, or skirts that were short in front, dipped in back. Less leggy but newer and niftier were the straight shirtwaists in navy and taupe pleated satin with enormous mother-of-pearl buttons. The fitted redingote jacket used as a coat-dress paraded through the collection. For daytime, it was best with a wide band of velvet down the front edged in gold buttons. For those who have n't the greatest legs, it would look fine with a skirt as well. This jacket-dress also came out for evening in a fitted military jacket blazed with swirling gold braid. It also appeared as a long blazer in colorful satin, either on its own with tights, or unveiling an eyeful of leg between an open, long chiffon skirt. <PERSON> Lagerfeld </PERSON> <PERSON> bErin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Slattery </PERSON> showing how the city sewer department dumped sludge into creeks and rivers; WBRZ-TV, <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, for a documentary by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Camp </PERSON> on the <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcoholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beverage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>.

 Sporting a shamrock on his lapel, <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Orekhovsky </PERSON> chuckled when he told of singing an Irish lullaby during the annual St. Patrick's Day parade down Main Street. He and 10 other members of a Soviet inspection team in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> under provisions of a 1987 nuclear arms reduction treaty were invited to the parade's reviewing stand in one of many appearances sponsored by Utahans eager to foster international goodwill. `` I sang ` <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Boy </PERSON>,''' he said in an interview at the apartment complex that is home to the 26-member contingent maintaining a round-the-clock vigil at <ORGANIZATION> Hercules </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION>'s missile manufacturing plant. <PERSON> Orekhovsky </PERSON> was public relations officer for the team, whose members serve six-week tours before rotating back to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. But until he left for home Monday, his movements, like those of all the Soviet inspectors who will be in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> for the next 13 years, were under the strict supervision of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. On-Site Inspection Agency. It's a control many <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> peace activists want relaxed. Since the original team arrived last July, the Soviets have been warmly received in classrooms and at sporting and cultural events. Team commander <PERSON> Nickolay </PERSON> <PERSON> Shabalin </PERSON>, speaking through an interpreter, recalled the `` special satisfaction'' of seeing <ORGANIZATION> Ballet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION>, a regional professional ballet company, perform `` <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Karenina </PERSON>,'' and a local exhibit of paintings by Soviet children. But <PERSON> Shabalin </PERSON> emphasized the Soviets' principal duty is to ensure that no Pershing II missile motors banned under the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty leave Hercules. The company stopped producing the motors in 1986 and none are stockpiled here. `` One should not get the wrong impression that the Soviet inspectors came here as tourists,'' said <PERSON> Orekhovsky </PERSON>. `` The most important reason that we arrive here is the verification of the treaty.'' Eight-man squads serve 24-hour shifts at a checkpoint by an entrance to the Hercules complex in western <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, inspecting outgoing vehicles and patrolling a road surrounding the former Pershing building. They work one day, then have two days off. `` The work of monitoring is not very complicated, but it is very responsible,'' <PERSON> Shabalin </PERSON> said. Under terms of the treaty, the visitors may not travel without an American escort or or go more than 31 miles from <LOCATION> Hercules </LOCATION>. The same conditions apply to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> inspectors at a similar plant in the Soviet city of <LOCATION> Votkinsk </LOCATION>. The inspectors have been tireless in accepting invitations to public forums. They say they do n't chafe under the rigid rules governing their excursions, but the same ca n't be said for some of their hosts. <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Firmage </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> law professor and anti-nuclear activist, and <PERSON> Rosemary </PERSON> <PERSON> Holt </PERSON>, president of Women Concerned About Nuclear War, are trying to persuade the inspection agency to allow the inspectors to accept dinner invitations at private homes. Both believe the agency's denial of private visits, for security reasons, is without merit, especially since the Soviets have appeared so often in public. When the first group of Soviets arrived, some were permitted to attend barbecues at a couple of private homes before the policy was changed, <PERSON> Holt </PERSON> said. `` We saw that not only as an opportunity lost for the citizens of <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, but for the Soviets to know us in a personal way,'' she said. `` There's a difference between sitting down with a cup of coffee, as opposed to speeches _ a world of difference.'' `` We must see each other fundamentally in our common humanness,'' <PERSON> Firmage </PERSON> said. `` The overwhelming, transcending reality is that we are human beings.'' Inspection agency spokeswoman <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, declined to discuss details but said security is paramount. There are other considerations, she said. `` If you get to where you're accepting some, but not others, you get into a discrimination problem,'' she said. <PERSON> Shabalin </PERSON>, vice director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Risk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reduction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, avoids any appearance of taking sides. `` The solution of this question rests with the proper <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> authorities,'' he said. `` Its positive or negative solution does n't affect in any way the accomplishment of the mission we have.

<HEAD>Researcher Says Higher Crop Yields Could Be Followed by Pests and
Diseases</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Climate warming could mean higher crop yields in the Northern states and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> but agricultural pests and diseases could well follow, a <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> researcher said Monday. <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenzweig </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geographers </ORGANIZATION> that the effects of threatened global warming must be studied in combination, not one at a time. For example, she said, scientists have tended to look at such things as temperature and rainfall and how those affect crops. Instead, she said, an overall study must be done not only of how each change affects life but of how the changes interact. <PERSON> Rosenzweig </PERSON> spoke at a session on global change, which focused on the greenhouse warming of the atmosphere many scientists say could have serious effects on mankind. The greenhouse theory is that carbon dioxide and other gases released into the atmosphere by industrial and other processes will trap heat from the sun, warming the planet in somewhat the same way that a greenhouse is warmed. Scientists speculate this could have an impact on crop growth and rainfall patterns and even could melt some of the polar ice caps and produce a disastrous rise in sea levels. There is disagreement over whether such a warming has already begun. Most meteorologists contend that last year's hot, dry summer was part of normal weather variability and not a result of the greenhouse effect. Nonetheless, scientists tend to agree that warming is likely in coming years, although the amount depends on factors not fully understood. <PERSON> Rosenzweig </PERSON> reported that she has looked at two models of potential climate change and found that the likely result would be smaller crop yields in the Southeast and <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, but increases in production in the Northern states and parts of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, largely due to the longer growing season as the climate warms. This warming led to increased need for irrigation in some areas, she added, and irrigation could become more cost-effective as smaller crop yields drove up prices. In addition to better crops in the Northern areas, however, the warmth will also allow survival of crop pests during the winter in more northerly areas, as well as the mosquitoes and other factors that can spread livestock diseases, she said. These findings illustrate the need to look at economic, medical and other results of climate change, she said. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Easterling </PERSON>, of the research firm Resources for the <ORGANIZATION> Future </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, told the same meeting that his company has begun a study focusing on the gradual response to change. Global warming will come gradually and people will seek ways to adjust to it, he said. It is necessary to start thinking about the technology, crop varieties and economic system that will exist 50 or 75 years in the future, said <PERSON> Easterling </PERSON>, in order to plan for climate change. Since the 1920s, he said, the growing of hard, red winter wheat has expanded from a region focused on <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> to areas extending all the way from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. This happened because of improvements in the varieties of wheat available and in farming methods, he said. Both <PERSON> Easterling </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rosenzweig </PERSON> stressed the need for increased research on drought and on crops that can resist heat. <PERSON> Rosenzweig </PERSON>, however, added that adjusting the type of crop grown helps cope with change in some areas, but is n't effective in all regions. At the same time, she said, climate change will be affecting the whole world, not just the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, so farmers need to keep in mind the needs of other nations and the export demand for their products.

<HEAD>Bush Says Compromise Necessary on Automated Weapons</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today called himself a proud member of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> but said a compromise must be struck on automated weapons because `` we're in a very different time now.'' `` The country needs to know that there is some answer to this. I do n't yet know what it is,'' he told a group of women state legislators. Later, White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters `` clearly there's been some evolution of his -LRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s -RRB- thinking'' on gun control. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> also voiced <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> concerns over reports that <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> officials had hinted at political repercussions to national drug control Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> if he cracks down too hard on gun sales. `` This is not a time for threatening people, but time to work together,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. Sources who spoke on condition of anonymity told the <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> last week that <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> had been receiving warnings from the rifle association through third parties hinting that <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION>'s campaign fundraising abilities might be used against him if he ever sought political office. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said through a spokesman, <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, that `` there have been a lot of phone calls, a lot of pressure. Let's cool off.'' At the time, <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> LaPierre </PERSON> called the allegations `` absolutely ridiculous.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> directed <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> to review the entire issue of semi-automatic weapons. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said today that the administration would take no further action until that review is complete beyond last week's banning of the import of semiautomatic weapons. In his talk to women legislators, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said: `` On the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION>, of which I am a member, a proud member, I believe we can find an accommodation between the legitimate interest of sportsmen and the interests of police chiefs, whose men put their lives on the line every day.'' `` We're in very different time now. I am convinced that reasonable men and women can work together to find an answer to the problem of these automated weapons,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s comments came against a backdrop of disagreement among senior federal officials over how fast and far the government should go in urging gun manufacturers to follow the example of <ORGANIZATION> Colt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and stop non-military sales of semiautomatic assault rifles. The head of the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawn </PERSON>, on Sunday urged an end to such sales, but drug czar <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> and Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> advised caution. `` I thought that was a very courageous action on the part of Colt. Guns are dangerous; law enforcement is suffering because of these guns,'' <PERSON> Lawn </PERSON> said on the <ORGANIZATION> CBS-TV </ORGANIZATION> program, `` Face the Nation.'' `` I am asking them to -LRB- take this action -RRB-, on behalf of the officers who are in danger every single day, because a police officer dies every 57 hours in this country,'' he said. Colt announced that it was suspending sales of its AR-15 semiautomatic rifle starting last Thursday, the day after President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> decided to ban temporarily the import of foreign-made assault rifles. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> urged a broader approach to combating illegal narcotics and said there are limits on what the government can tell private manufacturers of semiautomatic weapons. `` This is not a dictatorship,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>. `` We do not tell people how to do their business.'' But in a separate appearance on the <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION> program, `` Meet the Press,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said: `` I think we can make the case that we do n't need a whole lot more assault rifles on our streets right now. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> also said `` we have to get ... the person who is sometimes called the casual user. One expert in this field has told me that 70 percent of the cocaine that's used in this country is used by the so-called recreational user, the yuppie user.'' That person, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said, `` needs to realize ... the kinds of things he's responsible for _ the murder and mayhem that's going on in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the fact that we have babies now being born addicted to cocaine, the murder of <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> agents in other countries. `` These people are accessories to all those things, and they need to start paying a price for that.. If you're using cocaine and driving around in your BMW, when you get stopped you lose your BMW. There are ways we can make people pay the price and help them recognize what they're doing to the nation's children.'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> cautioned against believing that `` gimmicks'' could stop drug abuse. `` If we think that the only way to deal with the drug problem is to ban a particular type of weapon, we're dead wrong,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said on the <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION> program, `` This Week with <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkley </PERSON>.'' Addressing the issue of drug use in nation's capital, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said he had not yet decided whether to declare the federal district a `` high intensity drug trafficking area,'' enabling him to assemble a government strike force to fight drug dealing in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. As of Sunday, 118 murders had been reported in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in 1989, a record rate, and police say that nearly all are drug-related. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, quoting unidentified <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> aides, said Sunday that the strike force would target repeat drug offenders, try to shut down the city's 90 open-air drug markets, and use abandoned military facilities as temporary prisons for drug offenders. `` We are looking at whether we should do that or not,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said.

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ In reactors, radiology departments and research labs, workers at the end of the day cast off gloves and other discards whose radioactivity, though relatively mild, requires careful disposal. Now, with federal prodding, states are acting to find new ways of getting rid of mountains of low-level nuclear waste. Associated Press reporters have looked at the leaky legacy and uncertain future of the disposal process. Here, they examine the complexities of dealing with potentially lethal leftovers and how rural Nebraskans reacted to the possibility of a dump site in their midst.

 Here, at a glance, are highlights of actions taken Monday by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. NEWSPAPER MERGER The court cleared the way for the partial merger of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>'s two daily newspapers. The court, over two dissenting votes, set aside an earlier postponement that had been granted by Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>. A federal appeals court panel here voted 2-1 last Jan. 27 to uphold then-Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s decision to allow the newspapers to form a joint operating agreement under the federal Newspaper Preservation Act. The 1970 law empowers the attorney general to give financially failing newspapers an exemption from antitrust laws. Under the joint operating agreement, the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> and The Detroit News would combine their business, advertising and production departments but maintain separate news and editorial staffs. The case is <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Citizens for an <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> vs. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, A-695. PEYOTE The court agreed to decide whether there is a constitutional right to take the hullocinogenic drug peyote as a religious practice. The court agreed to review a ruling that <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> officials violated religious freedom by denying unemployment compensation to two men fired for using peyote at religious ceremonies. The case is Employment Division vs. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 88-1213. AGE BIAS The court agreed to use a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> case to decide whether federal courts may make it easier to broaden age discrimination lawsuits against employers. The court said it will hear an appeal by <ORGANIZATION> Hoffmann-La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which is accused of bias against older workers in laying off some 1,200 employees at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> plants. The case is <ORGANIZATION> Hoffmann-LaRoche </ORGANIZATION> vs. Sperling, 88-1203. ABORTION DEMONSTRATION The court turned away an appeal by 10 people criminally convicted for their participation in a 1985 protest demonstration at a <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> abortion clinic. The justices, refused to hear arguments that the defendants wrongly were barred from asserting medical justification as a defense for their crimes. The case is <PERSON> Markum </PERSON> vs. <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, 88-1218. HUSTLER The court let stand rulings that 1985 articles in Hustler magazine villifying two women active in fighting pornography are constiutionally protected expressions of opinion. The two women lost their attempts to revive libel lawsuits against Hustler magazine and its publisher, <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynt </PERSON>. The cases are <PERSON> Leidholdt </PERSON> vs. L.F.P. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, 88-1214, and <ORGANIZATION> Ault </ORGANIZATION> v. <ORGANIZATION> Hustler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magazine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, 88-1215. RELIGIOUS SERVICES Left intact rulings that the requirement of a Florida-based company that all its employees attend weekly Christian devotional services violated the rights of an atheist who worked there. The <ORGANIZATION> Townley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Chandler </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, lost its appeal, in which its lawyers argued that the owner's constitutionally protected religious freedoms were violated The case is <ORGANIZATION> Townley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> vs. <ORGANIZATION> EEOC </ORGANIZATION>, 88-988. ENVIRONMENTAL SUITS The court agreed to decide a narrow, but potentially significant, point of environmental law _ one that may affect the effectiveness of private citizen enforcement. The justices said they will consider reinstating a lawsuit against a <LOCATION> Tillamook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, landfill by the couple who own an adjacent dairy farm. The case is <PERSON> Hallstrom </PERSON> vs. <LOCATION> Tillamook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, 88-42. MILK The court turned away a still-pending, big-money antitrust dispute over the sale of raw milk. The justices, without comment, let stand a federal appeals court ruling that could cost millions for two cooperative associations of dairy farmers and a marketing agent for dairy cooperatives. The cases are <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Milk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Producers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> vs. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, 88-1247, and <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Milk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Producers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> vs. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, 88-1248.

<TEXT>
 A federal judge today stopped the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> from enforcing the city's new emergency curfew law for teen-agers. After a hearing on a suit brought by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Richey </PERSON> issued a 10-day temporary restraining order blocking enforcement of the statute. In issuing his ruling, the judge said the law was too broad. He noted that Mayor <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> has said alternative legislation will be proposed to narrow the law. <PERSON> Richey </PERSON> said he would extend the restraining order if <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>'s legislation does not differ from the emergency bill reviewed today <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>'s revised measure is expected to go to the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday or next week. The law went into effect last Thursday but <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> delayed enforcement of the measure until Monday night to give police time to become familiar with its provisions and to inform the public. <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Spitzer </PERSON> said the law would penalize youths and also could give them a permanent legal record. City attorneys, however, argued that parents would be penalized. But, <PERSON> Richey </PERSON> noted that the students' names would be entered into a permanent police record which might affect their ability to get jobs. The <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> filed suit on Friday to declare the temporary, 90-day law unconstitutional. The class-action suit was filed on behalf of the parents of five teen-agers, a 12-year-old boy and three other individuals. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> criticized the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> suit last week, saying `` the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> lawyers do n't sleep in these neighborhood where you ca n't sleep at night because gunshots, killings are going on.'' The curfew law requires persons under age 18 to be off the streets at 11 p.m. during the week, and by midnight on weekends. The curfew ends daily at 6 a.m.

 The late <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> tried to discredit a congressional staffer who had met with an official of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist government, a former <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> member said today. Former Rep. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>, D-Md., gave the testimony at <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s Iran-Contra trial while answering defense questions about <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, staff director of the Foreign Affairs subcommittee on <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION> affairs that <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> chaired <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> at the time was assisting <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> in pressing the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration to respond to press reports that <PERSON> North </PERSON> was soliciting contributions and providing tactical advice to the Contra rebels in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. Under cross-examination by North lawyer <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> said <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> requested a meeting in the fall of 1985 in which the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> director said the spy agency had intercepted a conversation of a Nicaraguan official. The other party in the conversation was <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> died in 1987. <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> said <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> as telling the Nicaraguan official that if <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> improved human rights and took other steps, those actions would help members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> who were trying to reject aid to the Contras. `` I found the allegations he made to be basically frivolous,'' said <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>. `` He did n't allege that members of my staff'' were passing classified information to the Nicaraguan government. `` I told him in my judgment, based on what he told me,'' that what <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> had done `` was perfectly appropriate,'' said <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>. Earlier today, <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> testified that then-national security adviser <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> seemed `` very nervous'' about congressional inquries over <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s activities. <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> described how <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> in a 1985 meeting offered to let him examine <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> documents pertaining to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels, but that <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> refused to let congressional staffers see them. The meeting in <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>'s office occurred after he had denied in a Sept. 12, 1985 letter to <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> that <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> staffers were engaged in fund-raising assistance and offering tactical advice to the Contras. North now is accused of obstructing <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and making false statements in connection with that letter and two others written in 1985. `` Were you aware that <PERSON> North </PERSON> collaborated with Mr. <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> on writing that letter,'' prosecutor <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Bromwich </PERSON> asked. `` No,'' responded <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>. The ex-congressman said that in a subsequent letter with <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> and face-to-face meeting, he requested all documents relating to communications between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> government and the Contras. `` I felt that Mr. <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> was very concerned about our investigation, very nervous about it,'' <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> said. He emphasized that `` I felt he was very nervous'' in the meeting. <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> said he rejected <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>'s offer to examine the documents, saying it was always necessary in such cases to have knowledgeable congressional staffers examine them. `` I was n't prepared to accept the restrictions'' that only he be permitted to look at the documents, said <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>. On cross-examination, <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> referred to a memo by congressional staffer <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> five days after the Sept. 12 written denial of Contra assistance. The memo said that if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> puts the executive branch in the position of non-disclosure on the <LOCATION> Contra </LOCATION> issue, that refusal `` embarrasses'' the administration `` and helps us.'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> sought to show that the Contra issue had become highly politicized. He brought out in questioning <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> that all members serving on a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> task force that was dealing with the issue were opposed to starting up aid to the rebels. During the period of <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>' inquiries, the <ORGANIZATION> Boland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amendment </ORGANIZATION> enacted by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> specified that no federal agency engaged in intelligence activities could spend money to assist the Contras.

<HEAD>Court to Rule Whether Taking Drug as Religious Practice Can Be a
Crime</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> agreed Monday to decide whether taking a hallucinogenic drug as a religious practice can be made a crime. The justices voted to review a ruling that <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> officials violated religious freedom by denying unemployment compensation to two men fired for using peyote at religious ceremonies. In their decision, expected sometime next year, the justices necessarily must resolve whether any state may criminally prosecute someone for the religious use of peyote. In other matters, the court: _ Cleared the way for the partial merger of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>'s two daily newspapers _ Agreed to let the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, through the solicitor general's office, participate in the April 26 oral argument scheduled for an abortion-regulation case from <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> State officials are asking the justices to use the case to reverse or limit the court's 1973 decision legalizing abortion. _ Let stand the criminal convictions of 10 people who participated in a 1985 protest demonstration at a <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> abortion clinic _ Refused to revive libel lawsuits, one in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and one in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, against Hustler magazine and its publisher, <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynt </PERSON>, by two women active in fighting pornography _ Turned down the appeal of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> death row inmate <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonin </PERSON>, the `` Freeway Killer'' of four teen-age boys in <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> _ Refused to bar <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> prosecutors who seek incriminating evidence from forcing the surgical removal of a bullet from a murder suspect's arm _ Left intact decisions thwarting a Florida-based company's requirement that all its employees attend weekly Christian devotional Lower courts said the mandatory services violated an atheist's rights. In the peyote case, the <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> last year ruled that its state's criminal law makes no exception for the religious use of peyote, a cactus `` button'' containing the hallucinogen mescaline. But the state court ruled that the federal Constitution's First Amendment, which protects religious freedom, bars state officials from denying unemployment compensation to two members of the <ORGANIZATION> Native </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. In effect, the state court said <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> criminal law must make an exception for `` good faith religious use of peyote by adult members of the <ORGANIZATION> Native </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>.'' The two men, <PERSON> Galen </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, had been fired from their <LOCATION> Douglas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, jobs counseling people who suffer from drug or alcohol addiction. There is no dispute that both men are members of the <ORGANIZATION> Native </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> and sincerely believe that peyote is part of the church's religious practices. Lawyers for the two men said using small quantities of the drug in that church is comparable to sacramental use of small quantities of wine in Christian religious ceremonies. The case was before the nation's highest court last year, and the justices voted last April to send it back to the <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. The April decision held out the possibility that states in which peyote is outlawed may deny unemployment benefits to workers fired for using it during religious ceremonies. But Justice <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, in writing for the court then, noted that the federal government and some states exempt the religious use of peyote from criminal prosecution.

<HEAD>Lawmakers Push For Water Efficiency Standards</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Americans are flushing too much of a precious resource down the toilet, say two lawmakers who are pushing for strict water-flow standards on household plumbing fixtures. Manufacturers are fighting the congressional attempt to impose first-ever federal efficiency standards on toilets, shower heads and other fixtures. The average American uses more than 18,000 gallons of water a year in the home _ about 50 gallons a day. Of that, 40 percent goes down the drain from toilets, said Rep. <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON>, D-Mass. `` The amount that is used unnecessarily is staggering, especially in light of the fact that new technology to improve performance of water-saving products is commercially available,'' he said. <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Wyche </PERSON> <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON>, D-Ga., have drafted legislation that would mandate national water efficiency standards for household plumbing fixtures such as faucets, washing machines, dishwashers, shower heads and toilets The largest savings would come from better toilets. Only one state, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, has imposed toilet efficiency standards. <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> <PERSON> Vickers </PERSON>, project manager at the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resource </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>, estimates that the new 1.6 gallons-per-flush state standard, which took effect earlier this month, will save the typical <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> household $ 70 a year. Older toilets typically use 5 gallons of water per flush; newer models, 3.5 gallons. <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>' standard will save the state about 70 million gallons of water daily by early in the 21st century, Ms. <PERSON> Vickers </PERSON> projected. On a national scale, that would mean a savings of 2 billion to 3 billion gallons of water a day from the most efficient toilets, she said. Proponents of low-flow standards say they could eliminate the need for building expensive water supplies and water-treatment facilities, especially in big cities such as <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> where officials already are worrying about balancing limited water supplies against ever-increasing demand. Toilet manufacturers oppose the legislation, saying it would create an unnecessary bureaucracy and amount to an improper intrusion by <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> into an area that has been traditionally handled by local governments. `` It puts the federal government for the first time directly into the process of writing building codes and standards. And the federal government, for the last 200 and some-odd years, has tried very hard to stay out of that process and leave it to the states and local communities,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Church </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Plumbing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. Church said it would be dangerous to `` force manufacturers to bring that technology out before it's completely tested,'' especially for installing the more efficient `` water closets'' _ as the industry still calls toilets _ in older houses. `` We're quite concerned that in specific localities there's apt to be severe problems if 1.6 -LRB- gallons-per-flush toilets -RRB- are the only ones available,'' said Church. `` You're asking for problems.'' `` Water closets are flushed with gravity. At 1.6 gallons, we're right on the edge of what gravity can actually do,'' he said But proponents of the legislation scoff at the suggestion that the bill's 1992 deadline for more efficient toilets would be difficult for the industry to meet. `` This is n't like trying to go to the <LOCATION> moon </LOCATION>,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Vickers </PERSON>. The two leading <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> toilet manufacturers, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kohler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, are fighting the legislation. Although the toilet provision has drawn the most controversy, the legislation is, as an <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON> aide, <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> <PERSON> Henken </PERSON>, says, `` by no means just a toilet bill.'' The proposal would set a 2.5 gallons-per-minute standard for shower heads and kitchen faucets, a 2 gallons-per-minute standard for bathroom faucets and a 1 gallon-per-flush standard for urinals, <PERSON> Henken </PERSON> said. Those requirements would take effect in January 1991, a year before the standard for toilets, he said. The bill also would require the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, within three years of enactment, to set water efficiency standards for washing machines and dishwashers.

 Real-estate magnate <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> said today he is no longer willing to pay $ 365 million for the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> shuttle, citing the labor problems that have largely grounded the financially troubled air carrier. He said he wants to cut the price by more than one-third. There was no immedite response from <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s Houston-based parent company In a letter to <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s parent company <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> said, `` The shuttle has become an entirely different business in that its market share and customer base may be lost for some time to come, if not forever.'' `` Today the business is worth considerably less than the price negotiated last fall,'' <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> said. Asked in an interview today how much he wants to cut the price, he said: `` I'm looking for a reduction in excess of $ 125 million.'' The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> billionaire financier announced last October that he would purchase the moneymaking operation for $ 365 million in cash and name it after himself. However, the strike by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union members, chiefly mechanics and baggage handlers, and the unwillingness of most of the airlines' pilots to cross their picket lines has forced <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> to file for bankruptcy. Only about 200 of the 3,600 Eastern pilots have been working since the strike by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> began March 4. Eastern has been operating only slightly more than 100 daily fights, about one-10th its normal level. The airline, which has begun advertising for new pilots, has acknowledged there are no near-term prospects for expanding its operations. Shuttle flights are among those still taking off. The airline has been struggling to keep the shuttle between <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in the air by offering a number of passenger incentives, including promotional fares as low as $ 12. Fares returned to normal Saturday. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> said he remained interested in buying the shuttle and would like to close a deal `` before the shuttle operations become worse.'' In his letter, he asked <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> to call him later today to discuss the sale. Asked about the Trump report, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashlock </PERSON> said, `` We do n't have any comment at all. We know absolutely nothing about it here.'' In <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> did not immediately return a telephone call seeking comment.

 A trial ended Monday for two dozen Britons accused in the deaths of 39 fans during a riot at the 1985 European soccer championship final, and the three-judge panel will issue a verdict April 28. The defendants, charged with involuntary manslaughter in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s worst soccer riot, face up to 10 years in prison if convicted Two Belgian police officials and a former chairman of the Belgian <ORGANIZATION> Soccer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> face lesser charges of poor security organization at the match. Monday's closing arguments ended more than five months of hearings to establish blame in the riots at <LOCATION> Heysel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stadium </LOCATION> prior to the May 29, 1985 final between <LOCATION> Liverpool </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Juventus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Turin </LOCATION> of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. `` All the cards are on the table'' for the judges to make their final decision, said public prosecutor <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Erauw </PERSON>. Belgian authorities requested the extradition of 26 Britons based on videotapes and pictures showing <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> fans tearing down the flimsy fence separating them from Italian supporters. The invasion of the stands caused panic during which victims were trampled to death as they tried to flee. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> complied with the extradition request in September 1987 and the trial began in a year later. The defendants had been allowed to wait at home for the trial to begin. More than 500 fans also suffered injuries in the riot.

<TEXT>
 A federal judge today declared a mistrial in the racketeering trial of six former narcotics officers accused of shaking down drug dealers as members of an elite police team known as Five Squad. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hannum </PERSON> made the ruling after the jury, which deliberated more than 30 hours over six days, reported it was hopelessly deadlocked. Charges against the ex-officers included conspiracy, racketeering and filing false tax returns. Prosecutors contended the defendants stole drugs and more than $ 400,000 seized from drug dealers. Defense attorneys attacked credibility of government testimony from three dozen drug dealers and two former members of Five Squad, which disbanded in 1985.

 <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> is still failing to heed many anti-terrorism measures an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> security firm suggested to the carrier more than two years ago, a congresswoman said today.

<HEAD>Iran Asks Return of 700 POWs; Calls Iraqi Proposal `Propaganda'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> on Monday said an <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> proposal to exchange all prisoners of war is a propaganda ploy and insisted on the return of more than 700 Iranians that <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> says were captured since an August truce. On March 5, <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> proposed the exchange of all 100,000 prisoners held by both sides outside the framework of the peace talks, which have been deadlocked since they opened in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> on Aug. 25. In a letter to the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, released Monday at <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> headquarters, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> noted that it had informed the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> seized over 700 Iranians, mostly soldiers, in the first weeks after the truce in the Iran-Iraq war began Aug. 20. The eight years of fighting came to an end after both sides agreed to negotiations that use U.N. Resolution 598 as a blueprint for a permanent peace settlement. Among other things, the resolution calls for withdrawal of occupying forces and prisoner exchanges. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> said the detention of the Iranians violates the Third Geneva Convention regulating the treatment of POWs, and it called on the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> to pressure <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> to release them. `` It is worth noting that during the first round of negotiations in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> for the implementation of Resolution 598, the foreign minister of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> announced the said prisoners would be released soon,'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s letter said, referring to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>'s peace plan `` It is now clear that the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> foreign minister's promise was made only for propaganda purposes at the time, which, like all other Iraqi statements of repatriation of prisoners of war are void of any humanitarian substance,'' said the Iranian letter. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> has registered 50,182 prisoners held by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and 19,284 held by <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, but <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials and diplomats estimate the total number of POWs is about 100,000. An agreement to exchange sick and injured prisoners of war in November broke down over mutual recriminations of bad faith, including the numbers of prisoners requesting asylum on both sides.

<HEAD>Army to Evaluate its Night-Vision Goggles</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it will conduct a special one-time evaluation of every night-vision goggle in its inventory to ensure the devices are safe for use by aviators. The service, in a brief statement, said the evaluation would involve about 12,700 of the devices and would require at least two weeks and possibly more to complete. The evaluation will include not only the two models of night vision goggles that are being used now, but also two other models that were suspended from flight use a year ago when safety questions began arising. Critics have questioned whether the goggles function properly when used if there is no moon or in cloudy weather. According to recent published reports, 37 of 41 <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> helicopter crashes since 1978 in which night goggles were used occurred when there was not enough moonlight for the devices to amplify. The most recent incident in which the use of night vision goggles has been questioned occurred just a week ago on the night of March 12. A CH-3E helicopter assigned to the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> crashed near <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, while ferrying some soldiers to a training range. Fifteen servicemen died in the accident. According to Capt. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Roque </PERSON>, a spokesman at the <ORGANIZATION> Davis-Monthan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, where the helicopter was based, the crewmen on that chopper were wearing goggles that night. But investigators have determined the goggles were not a factor in the accident, <PERSON> Roque </PERSON> said. The evaluations will be conducted by experienced <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> pilots and will take about 20 minutes each, said Lt. Col. <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Rixon </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. They can be performed on the ground in a specially lighted room. <PERSON> Rixon </PERSON> said the Army inspections are aimed at eliminating from the stockpile any goggles that suffer from a distortion problem that was identified some time ago. Inside the light-amplifying tubes of each goggle, there is a built-in twist to an optical fiber line that can produce distortion in the lens if not made properly, he explained. `` Every goggle that can be used for flight is going to be evaluated,'' <PERSON> Rixon </PERSON> said. `` If there are no problems, the goggle is cleared for use. If there is a problem, it takes about 45 minutes to change the tube.'' The spokesman said the cost of replacing the goggle tubes ranged from $ 1,100 to $ 5,000, depending upon the model.

 An American military helicopter crashed Monday during joint maneuvers with South Korean forces, killing 19 Marines and injuring 16, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military authorities said. It was the second fatal American helicopter crash in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> in four days. On Friday, all four Marines aboard were killed when a CH-46 assigned to the 13th Marine Expeditionary Unit based at <LOCATION> Camp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pendleton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, crashed in a rice paddy on the east coast. On Monday, a CH53-D Sea Stallion carrying four crewmen and 30 other Marines crashed near the southeastern port of <LOCATION> Pohang </LOCATION> during the joint exercises, a <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> spokesman reported. He said the injured included a Marine on the ground. Marine officials said investigators were at the site to determine the cause of the crash, but no quick result was expected because only charred pieces of the helicopter remained. The Marines were from the 1st Battalion, 5th Marines of the 1st Marine Division based at <LOCATION> Camp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pendleton </LOCATION>. The helicopter was assigned to the <ORGANIZATION> 1st </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wing </ORGANIZATION> based at <ORGANIZATION> Futenma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Yonhap </PERSON>, the South Korean news agency, quoted government officials as saying the helicopter appeared to have engine trouble and exploded in the air. A <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> newspaper, <PERSON> Kookmin </PERSON>, quoted a witness as saying one of two choppers hovering at about 250 feet suddenly turned upside down and plunged into a creek. About 10 men jumped out as it struck the ground, the report said. Both helicopters that crashed operated from the USS Belleau Wood, a Marine assault ship participating in the annual `` Team Spirit'' exercises, which began Tuesday. Some of those injured Monday were taken to the <LOCATION> Belleau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wood </LOCATION> and others were evacuated to a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military hospital in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. Marine officials withheld the identities of the dead and wounded pending notification of relatives. About 43,000 American soldiers are based in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> under a mutual defense agreement and 30,000 have been brought in for the maneuvers from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and elsewhere in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. This year's exercises involve about 200,000 military personnel from both countries. Dissidents demand an end to the joint maneuvers on grounds they increase tension on the divided peninsula and hamper talks with communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> on peace and reunification. Four people were injured Monday in a confrontation between police and about 700 villagers demanding an end to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bombing practice at the Koon-Ni range near a coastal village about 70 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. Villagers have held several violent protests around Koon-Ni, the only bombing range in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aircraft, demanding it be closed. They complain of noise and of danger from the bombing. At one point, <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION> reported, 72 villagers briefly occupied a small island inside the range and burned targets. There were no reports of arrests.

 <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION>'s worst water shortage in seven years has forced officials to cut water supplies throughout the southern Japanese prefecture for 24 hours every other day, officials said Monday. Water in two reservoirs averaged only 11.5 percent of capacity, while five reservoirs were averaging 44.6 percent of capacity, a local government official said. An <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION> weather bureau official said only 0.78 inches of rain fell in the prefecture in February, or 17 percent of normal. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military spokesman <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodrigues </PERSON> declined to comment on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> armed forces radio reports saying all non-official travel by American troops to <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION> was suspended until further notice because of the water shortage.

 A <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> town showed a markedly reduced drunken driving rate after residents were taught to use an inexpensive gadget to estimate their blood-alcohol levels, according to a study that experts called promising. The town's rate of driving with hazardous blood-alcohol levels was only about half that of a similar community that gave no training, the study found. Although the small study could provide only preliminary evidence that the program works, the results look encouraging, said co-author <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Worden </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vermont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>. He and colleagues from the university and state government present the work in this month's issue of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>. Experts said the results were promising, but that some questions about effectiveness remain to be answered. They also said such a program should be considered only in combination with other strategies to reduce drunken driving. The study involved three <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> communities which <PERSON> Worden </PERSON> declined to identify, two with populations of about 5,000 and the third approaching 12,000. They were similar in terms of education level, household income and the proportion of males among residents aged 16 to 29. In one community, an education program featured wallet-sized cards and small cardboard dials for estimating one's own blood-alcohol concentration according to body weight and the number of drinks consumed. About 3,000 dials were handed out in bars, stores, restaurants and filling stations. Customers were trained to use the dials at those outlets and in television announcements broadcast about 20 times a week. <PERSON> Worden </PERSON> stressed that training at the outlets was important because it ensured `` a lot of conversation about the program.'' A second town was exposed only to the television announcements, which mentioned a couple of local outlets for the dials. No training was provided at those outlets. The third town received no portion of the program. Six months after the program began, police stopped all traffic on six weekend nights in the three communities. Blood-alcohol concentrations were measured in 333 drivers from the community that had no part of the program, 405 from the town with only the television announcements, and 154 from the community with the full program. Analysis found that 11.1 percent of drivers from the town with no intervention had concentrations of at least 0.05 percent, the level at which the dial warned that driving becomes impaired. In the television-only community, 10.1 percent of drivers also reached that level. But only 5.8 percent of drivers from the full-program community scored that high. The legal driving limit of 0.1 percent blood alcohol was reached by 3 percent of drivers from the no-program community and 4.7 percent from the television-only community, but only 0.6 percent from the full-program community. <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Graitcer </PERSON>, of the federal <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>'s division of injury epidemiology and control, cautioned that questions remain about how effective such a program would be over a longer period, whether it would work in other settings, and whether it would in fact reduce accidents Still, the relatively inexpensive program offers `` a strategy that may work,'' he said. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosher </PERSON>, program director at the <ORGANIZATION> Marin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prevention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION> and Other Drug Problems in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rafael </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, said the program would be best used in combination with other efforts, such as training bartenders and waiters to regulate drinking among patrons. Such a package of strategies could also include increasing the excise tax on alcoholic beverages and using local laws to decrease risk of drunken driving, said <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagenaar </PERSON>, head of the injury analysis and prevention group at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Arbor </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 Dissidents said Monday they will fight on to oust President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON>, who indefinitely postponed a promised national referendum on his performance. Hundreds of students threw dozens of firebombs into two police stations in the southern city of <LOCATION> Kwangj </LOCATION>, shouting `` Punish <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo!'' according to the South Korean news agency <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION>. The attack destroyed a police motorcycle and caused other extensive damage, <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION> said. There were no immediate reports of injuries and arrests. <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION> said the students also shouted slogans demanding an end to annual `` Team Sprit'' exercises involving 200,000 South Korean and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers. The attack came after police sneaked into <ORGANIZATION> Chosun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> and removed wall posters denouncing the exercises, <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION> said. Dissidents have accused the exercises of heightening tension on the divided <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> peninsula and hampering unification with communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> has introduced broad democratic reforms since winning office in late 1987, but many South Koreans distrust the government because of its ties to the authoritarian regime of former President <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON>. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s main dissident alliance, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, urged <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> to stop `` fooling the people'' with the referendum issue and said the alliance will push for <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s resignation <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> postponed the midterm referendum he had promised during the 1987 election campaign, accusing anti-government forces of trying to use the vote to organize violent protests and topple the government. The vote was expected to be scheduled for mid-April. `` Violent leftist forces are trying to overthrow the government,'' <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> said in a nationally televised address Monday. `` Leftist forces are trying to use the midterm appraisal as a foothold for overthrowing the free democratic system.'' In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> was not legally required to call the vote. `` His decision is outside the normal constitutional requirements, in the sense that this is a referendum that he proposed himself. We certainly want to see a democratic process followed but at this point we do n't have any comment'' on the postponing of the referendum, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. The dissident alliance charged <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> wants to delay the referendum by recognizing his unpopularity. Some opposition and dissident forces have demanded <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> stake his presidency on the referendum and step down if defeated. It was not clear if <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> was backing away from the referendum because of concern about potential unrest or because he feared the government could not win the vote and might be forced into new elections. Some government officials had expressed concern about <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s ability to win a referendum. The government had said earlier that <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> would not resign if he was defeated, but some administration officials conceded a defeat would put pressure on <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> to call elections. The main opposition parties said they accepted <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s decision but would watch to ensure the government does not attempt to retreat on any other promises to bring in full democracy. The Party of Peace and Democracy of <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON> welcomed the referendum delay. The Reunification Democratic Party of <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Young-sam </PERSON> said it would accept only a temporary delay. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Young-sam </PERSON> had been pushing for a referendum after predicting <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> would lose. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON> opposed a referendum, apparently because <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Young-sam </PERSON>'s party had overtaken his in opinion polls. The Kims are bitter rivals who split the opposition vote in the December 1987 elections, allowing <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> to win with 36 percent of the vote. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> promised during the election campaign to hold a referendum after his first year in office to give voters a chance to evaluate his performance.

 At first glance, Puerto Rican mountain music, break dancing, and the house under the roller coaster at <LOCATION> Coney </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> do n't have a lot in common. But to <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Zeitlin </PERSON>, director of City Lore, all three pieces of the city's folk culture are worth preserving. City Lore documents and promotes ethnic traditions and neighborhood pastimes _ what <PERSON> Zeitlin </PERSON> calls `` the artistic genius of the average person.'' `` <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> has always been regarded as the cultural capital because of the opera and the ballet and things like that,'' he said. `` We say, it's also the cultural capital because of the enormous diversity of the population.'' Artists showcased by City Lore range from <LOCATION> Afghan </LOCATION> immigrants making rugs to women from <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION> braiding hair in traditional, elaborate designs. The Afghans live in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>; the Senegalese, in <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION>. `` By presenting these art forms at our annual summer festival in Central Park, in museums, at concerts, in the schools, we give these people a reason to keep their art form going,'' said <PERSON> Zeitlin </PERSON>. `` It's not something they have to give up to become American.'' Other artists featured by City Lore have included <PERSON> Papa </PERSON> <PERSON> Manteo </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> puppeteer whose Sicilian marionettes enact the legend of the ninth-century Roman Emperor <PERSON> Charlemagne </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Shenaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Hooda </PERSON>, who uses crushed henna leaves to paint lacelike designs on the hands of <ORGANIZATION> Muslim </ORGANIZATION> brides. If the dye left on the hands fades too quickly during the first weeks of marriage, the husband is said to have forced his wife to wash too many dishes. <PERSON> Hooda </PERSON> brought the tradition from her native <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION>. City Lore tries to preserve the best of pop culture before it gets repackaged by Madison Avenue and the media. `` There's so much pressure in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for things to be commercialized that something like rap music gets picked up immediately and becomes a national phenomenon,'' said <PERSON> Zeitlin </PERSON>. Neighborhood break dancers and rappers were featured at City Lore events long before these genres became staples on the rock video channel <ORGANIZATION> MTV </ORGANIZATION>. Musicians with roots in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and other Latin countries are given a forum in City Lore's Musica Tradicional concert series, held each summer. City Lore, which started out 10 years ago, has a $ 300,000 annual budget funded by private and government grants. Students, writers and artists use the group's archives; folk artists come looking for a place to perform and for help with grant applications. Neighborhood storytellers are featured on City Lore's monthly radio show on a public station. City Lore also is concerned with preserving the city's past. A project is under way to compile an oral history of the men who built the subway. And the organization is mounting an effort to save what it calls `` Endangered Spaces'' _ sites like the old-fashioned merchant stalls in the <ORGANIZATION> Essex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Market </ORGANIZATION> and the house under the roller coaster at <LOCATION> Coney </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. Immortalized in <PERSON> Woody </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>'s movie `` <PERSON> Annie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>,'' the house is in danger of being demolished. City Lore wants to save it, although the woman who lives there, the widow of the man who ran the roller coaster, `` was just as happy to move out,'' said <PERSON> Zeitlin </PERSON>. City Lore is hoping the house can be preserved in a form that will please developers as well as <LOCATION> Coney </LOCATION> Island-lovers: a restaurant.

 Six Israeli warplanes attacked a Palestinian base near the Syrian border Monday, killing six guerrillas and wounding nine people, including four civilians, police reported. Artillery duels continued between Christian army units and <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON>'s Druse militia, with many of the shells falling in residential areas. Police spokesman said five people were killed, including an army officer, and 15 wounded, four of them soldiers. That brought total casualties since the artillery and tank battles began March 8 to 54 killed and 179 wounded, most of them civilians. The Israeli fighter-bombers struck a base of the pro-Syrian Popular Front for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine-General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Dalhamiyyeh </LOCATION>, a neighborhood of Bar <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> town in the <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, six miles west of the Syrian border. Most of the 40,000 Syrian troops stationed in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> are based in the <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. A police spokesman, who can not be identified under standing rules, said the raiders destroyed the base and 10 nearby houses, and <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> soldiers cordoned off the area. Guerrillas of the radical Marxist Palestinian faction have claimed responsibility for several recent guerrilla attempts to infiltrate <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Soldiers killed two of the group's fighters March 12 in the `` security zone'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> maintains just inside south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Monday's raid was the fourth on <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> by Israeli planes this year. Police say two people were killed and 34 wounded in the three previous attacks. Police said the Druse and the forces of Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, who commands <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> army units, battled with tanks and heavy artillery around Souk el-Gharb, an army garrison town 15 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The spokesman said shells hit residential areas, the Christian ports of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jounieh </LOCATION> and the airport highway in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s airport, the only one in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, has been closed since March 11. Battles between Druse and army gunners began two days after <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, who heads a <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> government vying for power with a Moslem Cabinet, declared a blockade March 6 of private ports Lebanese militias run to finance their operations. Christian gunners aimed barrages of 155mm howitzer fire at the Shiite Moslem slums of south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, where most of the 15 Western hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> are believed held, and at the seaside suburbs <LOCATION> Khalde </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Doha </LOCATION>, the police spokesman said. He said Druse gunners bombarded <LOCATION> Jounieh </LOCATION>, 12 miles north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>; the Christian residential districts <LOCATION> Hazmieh </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Mekalless </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>; and <LOCATION> Metn </LOCATION> province. An Arab League mediation committee resumed efforts Monday to resolve the constitutional crisis, which has left <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> without a president for six months. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s ambassador to <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jassem </PERSON>, drove to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and met with several Moslem leaders, including Premier <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, who leads the Moslem cabinet, and <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON>, the parliament speaker. <PERSON> Jassem </PERSON> planned to meet with <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> leaders Tuesday. He said he would invite former Lebanese presidents and prime ministers to meet with the six-member committee March 25 at the league's headquarters in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>. That would be the third stage in negotiations on the crisis caused by <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>'s failure to elect a successor to President <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>, whose six-year term ended Sept. 22. Before stepping down, <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> appointed <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>, to lead an interim military Cabinet. Moslems refused to accept the appointment and remained loyal to <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, who was premier during the Gemayel presidency. By tradition, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s president is <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION>, the premier Sunni Moslem and the parliament speaker <PERSON> Shiite </PERSON>. The Arab League mediation effort has been complicated by the fighting between Christian army units and the Druse. It is the most serious sectarian warfare since 1985 in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 14-year-old civil war. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> demands that <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, which has become <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s main power broker, withdraw all its troops, but <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON> and other Moslem leaders reject the demand.

 Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> opened the annual legislative session Monday with a somber speech on <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s economic crisis that stressed centralized control and the need to halt political reforms. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s senior leader, 84-year-old <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>, did not attend the session of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> as he did last year. A Foreign Affairs Ministry official said only that <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> `` asked for leave.'' <PERSON> Li </PERSON>'s speech to the 2,768 legislators in the cavernous Great Hall of the People marked the consolidation of a policy of economic and political retrenchment that began in September. Whereas <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last year called for democracy and bold attempts to free <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s economy from rigid central planning, <PERSON> Li </PERSON>'s speech called for control. `` Experience has proved time and again that without the necessary centralization and unity, without strict organization and discipline, it would be absolutely impossible to readjust the economy and overcome difficulties,'' he said. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> also appeared to level veiled but pointed criticism at <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON>, who as premier in 1987 launched <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> on an ambitious reform program. Silent for most of the 130-minute speech, the delegates erupted in applause six times near its end when <PERSON> Li </PERSON> turned from the troubled economy to issues at the heart of Chinese nationalism: <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> and foreign affairs. Any support for the independence of <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said in reference to recent bloody riots in <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION>, `` constitutes an outrageous interference in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s internal affairs and will absolutely not be tolerated.'' He also warned the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to `` refrain from interfering with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s internal affairs ... lest the existing friendly relations between the two countries be impaired.'' The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> have expressed concern over the violent suppression of <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION> riots in which at least 16 people were killed this month. Most of the speech, however, focused on <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s troubled domestic situation. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> read slowly, in a low monotone, pausing often to clear his throat. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> faces a record 36 percent inflation that has sparked panic buying and bank runs. Rising crime affects its cities and corruption sullies the halls of government. Much of the troubles have been blamed on inflation. In September, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> began a program to tackle price rises by slowing reforms designed to introduce elements of a market economy to the state-run system. `` Both government and people should be mentally prepared for a few years of austerity,'' <PERSON> Li </PERSON> warned. Price reform, construction projects, loans, industrial growth and consumer demand all should be cut, he said. Even some productive projects `` should be stopped or suspended'' and necessary construction projects `` follow an order of importance and urgency.'' Only education and agriculture would be spared, <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said. To halt a four-year slide in grain production, the state will raise its grain purchase price by 18 percent on April 1, he said. And banks will increase agricultural loans. He also announced a 15 percent increase in the education budget, to $ 10 billion. Both sectors are considered key to development and critics say they have been overlooked in recent budgets. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> appeared to blame party leader <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> for inflation _ the root of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s trouble. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> backed a full-steam-ahead approach to reforms when he was premier in 1987, while <PERSON> Li </PERSON> was more cautious. At one point, <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> said the only criterion for whether reforms were successful was whether they raised production. <PERSON> Li </PERSON>'s speech roundly criticized this. `` We were too optimistic in our assessment of the economic situation in 1987,'' he said. `` Instead of taking effective measures ... we relaxed control over and readjusted the prices of more commodities only to intensify the panic of the masses over the price hikes and evoke a buying spree.'' The premier ignored a growing public clamor among intellectuals for greater freedom of speech, evidenced by a recent call for an amnesty for political prisoners. Instead, he said, all dialogue must take place `` under the leadership of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Li </PERSON> also said the economic troubles made it necessary to postpone temporarily political reforms that would give more decision-making power to businesses previously run by the state. Also, overstaffed governments were to be cut back and a civil service system introduced. The congress is meeting through April 4. Two important laws are expected to pass. One will give citizens the right to sue the government. The other outlines the powers of the congress, which does little but routinely endorse policy directed by the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Judge Temporarily Bars DC Curfew as Unfair to Teen-agers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A federal judge, turning aside a plea for `` desperate measures'' against drug-related violence in the nation's capital, on Monday temporarily barred the city from enforcing a curfew aimed at keeping most teen-agers away from open-air drug markets late at night <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Richey </PERSON>, in issuing a 10-day temporary restraining order, ruled that the overnight curfew law could unfairly penalize thousands of youths and result in `` permanent and irreparable injury'' to those detained unfairly under the anti-drug trafficking statute. His ruling came despite an argument by district officials that the city's record murder rate required immediate action. `` These are desperate times, and they require what may well be considered desperate measures,'' argued <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander-Smith </PERSON>, assistant corporation counsel. `` You see it on TV every night _ the criminal element has taken over the streets ... and is seducing the children.'' The district has recorded 119 homicides this year, up from 73 for the same period last year. For all of 1988, there were 372 homicides, an all-time high. The <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> last week passed an emergency law banning teen-agers under the age of 18 from gathering on city streets after 11 p.m. Sunday through Thursday and after midnight Friday and Saturday. The curfew would have ended at 6 a.m. each day. It was designed to keep young people from buying or selling drugs on city street corners or open-air drug markets. Enforcement was scheduled to begin Monday night, even though Mayor <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and Corporation Counsel <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooke </PERSON> acknowledged that the plan might violate constitutional guarantees of freedom of assembly and privacy rights. `` To enact a law that raises serious constitutional questions when -LRB- city officials -RRB- know themselves it will not work ... gives me chills,'' the judge said. <PERSON> Cooke </PERSON> also had said the bill might not slow the pace of drug-related shootings, since police statistics indicate that the average ages of murder victims and perpetrators in the nation's capital are both over 30 The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> asked that the curfew be ruled unconstitutional, claiming that it unfairly prevented thousands of city teens from attending church, school or other legitimate functions late at night. `` This curfew was a reaction to this problem, not a solution,'' said <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Spitzer </PERSON>, legal director for the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION>'s National Capital chapter. `` It will hardly deter a teen-ager bent on committing a crime. It will deter law-abiding teen-agers from going about their business.'' <PERSON> Richey </PERSON> said he was also worried that those detained while waiting for a bus or coming home from a school play would have what amounted to a police record that could harm their future employment or educational prospects. A police enforcement order indicated that those detained would not formally be charged, but still would have their fingerprints taken and their names entered into a permanent police data bank. `` Once those names get in there, how do you get them out?'' <PERSON> Richey </PERSON> asked. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>, anticipating legal opposition to the plan, last week drafted an alternative bill. <PERSON> Richey </PERSON> ruled that he might extend the restraining order indefinitely if <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>'s alternative bill is not satisfactory. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>'s bill includes a broad range of exemptions from the curfew, including starting the curfew at 11:45 p.m. to allow teen-agers time to return home from social events. In addition, it includes a blanket exemption for those returning from school or church functions and those traveling with parents or guardians. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>'s bill also attempts to resolve a conflict with constitutional freedom of assembly guarantees by allowing for teen-agers to gather on city streets during curfew hours for protests or forums, provided that police officials have been notified first. Both bills penalize parents, not the teen-agers. Starting with the second offense, parents would be forced to pay a series of graduated fines ranging from $ 200 to $ 500.

 Astronaut <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Springer </PERSON> had hoped something might go wrong on the five-day voyage of Discovery so he could leave the space shuttle to fix it, his mother says. `` Bob was hoping for just some little problem so he could take a space walk,'' <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Springer </PERSON> said Sunday from her son's home in <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The latest polls show voters favor a left-of-center coalition over Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s conservative government, and a Cabinet shakeup is in the works to arrest his party's tumble in popularity. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> is on his annual slimming down cure at a spa in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, but he announced before his departure from the capital on Friday that he would spend his two-week Easter break considering changes in his coalition government. In his absence, West German media and prominent politicians have been speculating on the impending reorganization and some want the embattled chancellor to cut down his own portfolio by resigning as party leader. An atmosphere of political crisis has marred <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> for more than a week and called into question whether the <ORGANIZATION> CDU </ORGANIZATION> can stay in power after the next federal balloting in December 1990. The prospect of a liberal coalition governing in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> portends a major policy shift in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, an important <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ally, where a leftist and pacifist trend has been gaining ground for more than a year. Major newspapers on Monday continued to give the political turmoil top priority, as they did over the weekend when new opinion polls were released showing a further slide in support for <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> CDU </ORGANIZATION> and the centrist <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> with which it is aligned A survey conducted by the respected <ORGANIZATION> Emnid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> indicates more interest among West Germans for an alliance between the liberal Social Democrats and the environmentalist Greens party. The Hamburg-based weekly <ORGANIZATION> Welt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sonntag </ORGANIZATION> reported the poll shows a majority of voters would back a liberal alliance, but it did not provide specific figures.

 <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s popularity and that of the <ORGANIZATION> CDU </ORGANIZATION> have suffered from a scandal over West German companies' involvement with a Libyan chemical weapons plant and <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>'s foot-dragging over whether to support <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> plans to replace some aging Lance missiles with longer-range rockets. Domestic issues, such as the unpopular reform that made health care more expensive, have also contributed to <ORGANIZATION> CDU </ORGANIZATION> troubles. The <ORGANIZATION> CDU </ORGANIZATION>'s problems have rubbed off on its coalition partner, the Free Democrats, who have also been losing ground in recent elections and opinion polls. The <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> have been losing ground in state elections since <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> was re-elected in 1987, most recently in <LOCATION> Hesse </LOCATION> state balloting where the party lost control of the <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> city government and other important industrial centers. The Hesse setbacks followed a surprising loss Jan. 29 in elections to the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> legislature in which the left and far right posted gains. The city-state that had been controlled by the <ORGANIZATION> CDU </ORGANIZATION> for more than a decade is now being governed by a coalition of <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> and an umbrella group of leftists known as the Alternative List. In an effort to invigorate the <ORGANIZATION> CDU </ORGANIZATION> and boost its appeal to voters, <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> is weighing calls from his party and the Free Democrats to cast off unpopular Cabinet members like <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Minister <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON> <PERSON> Scholz </PERSON> and Health Minister <PERSON> Ursula </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehr </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Court Urged to Overturn Award Against Ohio Paper</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> was urged Monday to overturn a $ 200,000 libel award against a <LOCATION> Hamilton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, newspaper. A federal appeals court ruling that upheld the award makes `` a mirage'' of the required appellate court review of libel lawsuits won by public figures, the justices were told. `` The central difficulty of the court of appeals ruling is that it eviscerates the rule of independent review,'' argued <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lawyer for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hamilton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal-News </ORGANIZATION>. The award was won by <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Connaughton </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Hamilton </LOCATION> lawyer who unsuccessfully ran for the office of municipal judge in a 1983 election against incumbent <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dolan </PERSON>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, a lawyer representing <PERSON> Connaughton </PERSON>, urged the justices to uphold his client's legal victory. `` His evidence was massive, his cause was just,'' <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> contended after accusing the newspaper of writing falsehoods about <PERSON> Connaughton </PERSON> with `` perverse, premeditated ignorance.'' The court's decision, expected by July, could supply important new guidelines about how closely appeals courts must scrutinize jury findings of `` actual malice'' when a public figure sues for libel. About five weeks before the municipal judge election, <PERSON> Connaughton </PERSON> filed a private criminal complaint with <LOCATION> Hamilton </LOCATION> police based on corruption allegations against <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> New </PERSON>, then the municipal court's chief administrative officer <PERSON> Connaughton </PERSON> told police that two women claimed to have paid bribes to New to `` fix'' cases, and that one of the women said some of the transactions had occurred in <PERSON> Dolan </PERSON>'s presence. New eventually was convicted of bribery. <PERSON> Dolan </PERSON> was not indicted. <PERSON> Connaughton </PERSON>'s campaign contended that <PERSON> Dolan </PERSON> bore the ultimate responsibility for `` any failure to manage the court or its employees.'' A Nov. 1, 1983, article in the <PERSON> Journal-News </PERSON> said one of the women who offered grand jury testimony against New `` claims <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Connaughton </PERSON> offered her and her sister jobs and a trip to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> ` in appreciation' for their help.'' The article quoted the woman as saying she thought <PERSON> Connaughton </PERSON> used `` dirty tricks'' in obtaining her cooperation with his investigation of New. <PERSON> Connaughton </PERSON> sued <ORGANIZATION> Harte-Hanks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION>, the newspaper's publisher, for libel A federal jury awarded him $ 5,000 in compensatory damages and $ 195,000 in punitive damages. The 6th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> upheld the award last year, rejecting the newspaper's arguments that a 1984 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision required a reversal of the verdict. In a case called <PERSON> Bose </PERSON> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Consumers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's highest court in 1984 said appeals courts have broad authority _ and a constitutionally required obligation _ to second-guess trial courts in libel cases filed by public figures. To win a libel suit, a public figure must prove the allegedly libelous statement was false and was made with `` actual malice'' _ knowledge or reckless disregard of its falsity. In the 1984 ruling, the justices said appeals court judges `` must independently decide whether the evidence in the record is sufficient to cross a constitutional threshold that bars the entry of any -LRB- libel -RRB- judgment that is not supported by clear and convincing proof of actual malice.'' In <PERSON> Connaughton </PERSON>'s case, the 6th Circuit court said the 1984 call for independent review does not apply to a case's facts but instead `` was limited to a review of the ultimate conclusion of clear and convincing proof of actual malice.'' Attacking that ruling Monday, <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> argued for the <LOCATION> Hamilton </LOCATION> paper that the 6th Circuit `` erected a presumption of actual malice in every case.'' But <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> contended that if the justices reverse <PERSON> Connaughton </PERSON>'s victory they would be erecting `` a rule of absolute immunity'' for the news media against libel suits by public figures He said a decision favoring the <ORGANIZATION> Hamilton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal-News </ORGANIZATION> would `` send a signal'' to other defamed public figures `` to give up.'' The case is <ORGANIZATION> Harte-Hanks </ORGANIZATION> vs. <PERSON> Connaughton </PERSON>, 88-10.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mena </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> presidential candidate, today acknowledged the victory of right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Arena </ORGANIZATION> candidate <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> in the presidential election. `` As a democratic party, we recognize the victory of <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> with more than 50 percent of the vote,'' <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mena </PERSON> told a news conference. `` I have called him personally to congratulate him and express my desire that God illuminate him in governing the country.'' <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>, a wealthy coffee grower, said Sunday night his party's unofficial tally showed him leading with 54 percent of the vote with about 75 percent of the ballots counted Leftists rebels tried to thwart the voting with nationwide attacks, and the military said six soldiers and 23 guerrillas died in clashes during the balloting. Security forces killed three journalists _ two Salvadorans and a Dutchman. The guerrillas today lifted the road transport ban that paralyzed traffic for four days, but rebels sabotaged communications and power lines, slowing the vote count. `` We are sure and we proclaim ourselves the victors,'' said <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Aubuisson </PERSON>, founder of the party known as <PERSON> Arena </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON>, an Arena delegate to the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elections </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, said that unofficially, <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> received 54.96 percent of 131,832 votes counted by early today. <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mena </PERSON>, a 49-year-old lawyer, was running second with 34.48 percent of votes counted, with <PERSON> Moran </PERSON> <PERSON> Castaneda </PERSON> of the conservative <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conciliation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> third at 4.68 percent, said <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON>. He told reporters he was speaking as the Arena delegate and not for the <ORGANIZATION> Elections </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> did not say how many people voted or explain how the figures were obtained. Earlier today, he said the results were delayed because local officials had trouble reporting results by telephone. A <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> victory would leave <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> supporting a government run by a party long associated with extremism. In elections last March, <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> wrested control of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> from the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>. The rebels claimed a low voter turnout rendered the results meaningless. Their <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> had called for a boycott and mounted widespread attacks to keep voters at home, although they promised not to attack those who went to the polls. Unofficial reports by a television station, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> and the leftist Democratic Convergence party indicated <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> gained the majority needed to avoid a runoff. A team of 21 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> observers said the vote appeared to have been fair, but one observer said violence frightened many people away. `` There is no question that the intimidation of the -LRB- rebels -RRB- is working,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Doherty </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> official on the team. <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>, 41, campaigned as a moderate. However, at his side throughout the campaign was <PERSON> D'Aubuisson </PERSON>, a former army major accused of links to right-wing death squads. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has sent $ 3.5 billion in military and economic aid to the government during its 9-year-old war with the rebels that has left 70,000 dead, mostly civilians. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> has been aimed at shoring up a centrist government represented by the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> and President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>, who is dying of liver cancer and leaves office June 1. Some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> lawmakers have said that if <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> wins, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should re-evaluate its policy. Among the election observers was Rep. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, D-Calif., who said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will need to debate whether to continue current levels of military and economic aid `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must recognize the will of Salvadorans,'' <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> said in a television interview Sunday night. He said he saw no reason `` we ca n't have a relationship of mutual understanding.'' <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said a victory for <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> would not signify a defeat for American policy. `` <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy here was not to project an image of being in support of a party or a candidate,'' he told <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America'' from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. `` Whatever party wins ... as long as they're a democratic force, as long as they observe human rights in this country, we do n't care really whether they're right of center, center or left of center.'' Government forces and leftist guerrillas battled in 12 of the country's 14 provinces on Sunday and combat prevented voting in four of the nation's 262 municipalities. No voting had been planned in 19 others that were under rebel control. Col. <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Emilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON>, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, said the armed forces `` repelled what was in reality a nationwide offensive by the -LRB- rebels -RRB-.'' The Salvadoran Correspondents' Association, citing the deaths of the three journalists covering the vote, accused the military of intimidation. <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON> said a soldier was arrested in one of the killings and the others were being investigated. <PERSON> Arena </PERSON>'s campaign blamed the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> for failing to end the war and for a steady economic slide. <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> has said <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> will negotiate peace once the rebels put down their arms. Otherwise, he has said, they can expect an intensification of the stalemated war. <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> describes his economic policy as `` capitalism for the masses.'' He is expected to return the national coffee company, <LOCATION> Incafe </LOCATION>, to private hands and allow the return of private banks. Incafe and the banks were nationalized as part of U.S.-backed <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> economic reforms. About 1.83 million people out of a population of 5 million were eligible to vote.

<TEXT>
 At the center of the controversy over bomb warnings before the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 disaster is a classic British political confrontation: an old Etonian millionaire Cabinet minister vs. an ex-waiter leading an opposition onslaught. For Transport Secretary <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Channon </PERSON>, son of a British brewing heiress and an American social high-flyer, the Dec. 21 crash in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> was the low point in an unprecedented string of rail, air and sea disasters in the past two years. And from his departure for a vacation at his private villa in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> on Dec. 23 through mounting charges the past five days that he bungled bomb warnings, <PERSON> Channon </PERSON> has been under concerted attack by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Prescott </PERSON>, a railman's son who is the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s transport spokesman. `` My response is one of contempt,'' <PERSON> Channon </PERSON> said over the weekend. `` His behavior has been both callous and cynical. ... He is exploiting the grief of the bereaved.'' The latest furor began after a newspaper revealed last week that <PERSON> Channon </PERSON>'s department warned British airlines Nov. 22 of a radio-cassette bomb, four days after the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> sent the same warning to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines, including <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>. A detailed description and picture of the bomb dated Dec. 19 was mailed `` in the new year'' by the <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to British airlines and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines _ well after a bomb hidden in a radio-cassette player brought down Flight 103 over the Scottish village of <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, killing 270 people. Despite unattributable briefings from <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s aides that she still supports him, <PERSON> Channon </PERSON> looks increasingly defensive as <PERSON> Prescott </PERSON> hammers home charges of cavalier and secretive behavior. <PERSON> Channon </PERSON> has said the Dec. 19 warning was `` unimportant'' and that he did n't tell <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> about either warning because of the continuing inquiry and because the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> dealt with <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>. Said <PERSON> Prescott </PERSON>: `` This has all the signs of a cover-up once they realized the bungle they had made of it all.'' <PERSON> Channon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Prescott </PERSON> come from the extremes of mainstream British political life. <PERSON> Prescott </PERSON>, 50, left school at age 15 to become a ship's waiter and got to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> after battling through the ranks of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seamen </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Channon </PERSON>, 54, is reputedly the richest member of the Thatcher Cabinet. He was born to privilege and politics and an inherited fortune as a member of the Guinness brewing family. His father, Sir <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Channon </PERSON>, came from a rich <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> family, married into the Guinness family and became a member of Parliament. After <ORGANIZATION> Eton </ORGANIZATION>, an elite Guards regiment and <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Channon </PERSON> was elected to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> at the age of 23. He was then its then youngest member, representing a safe <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> district, <ORGANIZATION> Southend </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION>, that had been held by his father, and before that by two other family members. However, it took <PERSON> Channon </PERSON> 27 years to get into the Cabinet. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> named him Trade and Industry Secretary in 1986 and, in what was widely seen as a demotion, moved him to transport after <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s June 1987 general election. <PERSON> Channon </PERSON>'s 22-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Olivia </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> student, died of a drug overdose in 1986 after an around-the-clock party at the university to celebrate final examinations. Three fellow undergraduates, including a cousin and another Guinness heir, were charged with drug offenses _ raising a public outcry over a drugs scandal among the children of privilege. Since then, <PERSON> Channon </PERSON> has been one of the most publicized members of the 22-member Cabinet: announcing in slightly tentative, upper class tones another inquiry into yet another disaster, his face anxious and solemn at another scene of carnage. He took over transport during an inquiry into the March 1987 British ferry disaster off the Belgian port of <LOCATION> Zeebrugge </LOCATION> that killed 193 people and revealed lax safety procedures. Then followed a fire at <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s King's <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> subway station that killed 31 people in November 1987; the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> disaster; a British <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION> jet crash onto a highway on Jan. 8, killing 37 people; and three major rail accidents since December that killed 42 people.

<TEXT>
 Poison specialists on Monday demonstrated a new child-resistant medicine cap they hope will solve the problem of caps that are too difficult for the elderly to open. In ceremonies marking the opening of National Poison Prevention Week, <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, the acting chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Product </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, noted that roughly half the accidental medical poisonings of children under age 5 were from child-resistant packages that had not been properly resecured or from non-child resistance containers holding medicines originally packed in child-resistant containers. Child poisonings have declined greatly with the advent of the child-resistant caps, from 216 deaths of children under 5 in 1972 to 59 in 1986. Nonethess, Ms. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> noted, studies show that 35 percent of the medicines ingested in child-poisoning cases come from people not in the immediate family, most frequently grandparents. Like the present mechanism, the new cap device has an inner and outer cap that lock together when the outer cap is pressed down on the inner cap. Unlike the present design, the inner and outer caps of the new mechanism each has a small slot across part of a diameter. When the slots are aligned, a spoon handle may be inserted into both to make the two caps turn together, using the spoon as a lever, without downward pressure on the outer cap. `` This is our first effort,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wygant </PERSON>, professor of industrial engineering at <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kalamazoo </LOCATION>, at the news conference at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. `` We have many other tests to do.'' <PERSON> Wygant </PERSON> developed the prototype cap from a design by Professor <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Lockhart </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. The design emerged from earlier work by <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Wygant </PERSON>, who estimated that more than a billion caps are made for medicine alone every year, said that among other problems to be solved was the production of clear instructions and making the caps easy to manufacture. Commission spokesmen said the commission plans to require use of the caps, or something similar, once all the bugs are worked out.

<TEXT>
 Bones found at a site identified by serial killer <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> as the grave of one of his victims have been sent to state forensic experts to determine if they are human, police said Monday. The <ORGANIZATION> Wayne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the bones, which investigators believe may be those of 17-year-old <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilcox </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Holladay </LOCATION>, were delivered by Highway Patrol troopers to the state medical examiner's office in <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Testing of the bones, found Friday, should be finished Thursday or Friday, Sheriff <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Ekker </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> was executed Jan. 24 in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s electric chair. Before he died, he told detectives he had killed more than 20 women, including eight in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>. Of the <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> victims, he identified only three, among them <PERSON> Wilcox </PERSON>, who he said was buried near <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reef </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, 200 miles south of <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The bones were among remains found at three sites a mile east of the park. Also found at one of the sites was a fragment of what appeared to be a tan blouse. Bones at two of the sites were believed to be those of animals. <PERSON> Ekker </PERSON> noted that the bones sent to the crime lab were found partially exposed, and that the site would not be further excavated until the medical examiner's office completes testing. The other two women <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> identified among his early has, up to now, has been the choice of filmmakers. That seems kind of ludicrous, since there's only two movies in 10 years where product placement fees were paid,'' she said. Before the current <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> arrangement, <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> paid to get one of its brand names on screen just once: $ 42,500 to get its Marlboro cigarettes included in the movie `` Superman II,'' the company told the subcommittee <PERSON> Luken </PERSON> heads. <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said it paid $ 30,000 to get its Eve brand in the movie `` Supergirl.'' In letters to <PERSON> Luken </PERSON>'s subcommittee, the companies said their Japanese advertising agency arranged the $ 350,000 deal to promote the Lark brand. The agreement calls for the movie to include a scene in which Agent 007 pulls out an explosive device disguised as a package of Larks. The letters were in response to a request to all American tobacco companies seeking a 10-year inventory of motion pictures in which the companies paid to have their product or brand name featured. <PERSON> Luken </PERSON> heads the transportation and hazardous materials subcommittee of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 Almost a quarter-million Soviets are living on land so contaminated by the <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> disaster that they must receive special food supplies to avoid overexposure to radiation, the newspaper Pravda said Monday. The Communist Party daily printed maps showing contaminated areas of <LOCATION> Byelorussia </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION> and the Russian republic in response to readers' complaints they still did n't have full information about the level of contamination nearly three years after the accident. It was accompanied by a commentary by Pravda science editor <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gubarev </PERSON>, who criticized officials for trying to duck public concern about the safety of nuclear power. `` Yes, it is impossible to get around using nuclear power stations. However, why then are they proposed for heavily populated or seismic zones?'' <PERSON> Gubarev </PERSON> asked. `` Why is the quality of construction so low, and why does so much defective equipment arrive at nuclear plants? And, finally, what is the source of this fear before a public which rightly demands a wide debate of every proposed nuclear power station?'' <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Izrael </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hydrometeorology </ORGANIZATION>, said with decontamination efforts and food brought into the area, those on the lands contaminated by Cesium 137 can live safely without exceeding radiation limits set by the government. Soviet officials began bringing food supplies into areas surrounding the Chernobyl plant shortly after the accident, but they had not previously said how many people were living in those areas. The publication came as Soviet officials again started to move villagers who have continued to live in areas surrounding the plant since the accident in April 1986 that killed at least 31 people. In February, scientists decided that 20 Byelorussian villages must be evacuated because over a lifetime their residents would receive an unacceptably high dose of radiation. Earlier this month, officials announced that five villages in the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION> also would be evacuated. In November, the Soviet government set a maxium lifetime dose of 35 rem -LRB- roetgen equivalent, man -RRB- for exposure to radiation. That figure has a comfortable margin of safety built into it, <PERSON> Izrael </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Izrael </PERSON> said the area of the three republics where the current level of radiation from both the environment and existing food supplies would expose residents to more than 35 rem includes 4,000 square miles including about 640 settlements with 230,000 people. That includes 800 square miles in the Russian republic, 600 square miles in the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION> and 2,800 square miles in <LOCATION> Byelorussia </LOCATION>, including 1,200 square miles in areas that have been evacuated. `` So far they have gone the route here of trying to guarantee this population clean food and extra income,'' <PERSON> Izrael </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Izrael </PERSON> said studies showed that residents could remain safely as long as they did not eat the food, especially meat and milk produced in the area, which sharply increased the amount of radiation to which they were exposed. He quoted the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Sovietskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Byelorussia </ORGANIZATION> as saying in a study of the <LOCATION> Gomel </LOCATION>, Mogilev and <LOCATION> Brest </LOCATION> regions of the republic less than 0.1 percent of the population had received an unacceptably high level of radiation. As of last fall, there had been no cases of radiation sickness, he said. Scientists are debating how many more cancer deaths might be expected in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> as a result of the Chernobyl accident. In <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, they have estimated there may be up to 200,000 deaths in the next 20 to 25 years from <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> radiation. But <PERSON> Izrael </PERSON> said that long years of work were ahead to decontaminate the region. `` Insufficiencies in this work must be compensated by replacement with clean food -LRB- especially by bringing in milk -RRB-. In this case life and work is possible within the framework of the acceptable levels established by the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Izrael </PERSON> said that within the first days after the explosion and fire at the Chernobyl plant's No. 4 reactor, the direction of the wind made a complete circle and dropped radiation all around the plant. The entire population living within 18 -LCB- miles of the plant, or about 135,000 people, were evacuated and resettled. Since then, many Soviets have begun to speak out against nuclear power. Citizens' protests or tougher standards imposed after the Chernobyl accident have stopped several nuclear power plants. A plant near <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, not far from the site of the Dec. 7 earthquake, was shut down Saturday.

<TEXT>
 Detectives whose partner was killed during a drug raid lied so many times to try to bring the alleged murderer to trial that they blew the case, defense lawyers argued Monday. Other lawyers say the admitted misconduct by police could also call into question dozens of convictions in which the officers participated. Defense attorneys and the prosecutor agreed during the <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> hearing Monday that there was serious police misconduct in the case against <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewin </PERSON>, 33, accused of shooting the detective Feb. 17, 1987. But the prosecutor, Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Meara </PERSON>, argued that <PERSON> Lewin </PERSON> should stand trial because there is strong evidence against him and because the police have `` come clean'' by admitting they lied to obtain a search warrant and hid the identity of potential witnesses. The three detectives, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Luna </PERSON>, 32, <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Amate </PERSON>, 31, and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON>, 33, were suspended with pay while the attorney general investigates possible perjury. Judge <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grabau </PERSON> dismissed the murder charge against <PERSON> Lewin </PERSON> last month, but agreed to consider reinstating it after the detectives filed affidavits last week admitting they previously lied. <PERSON> Grabau </PERSON> said he would rule next week whether <PERSON> Lewin </PERSON> can be tried for the murder of Detective <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffiths </PERSON>. Defense attorney <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> argued that the case against <PERSON> Lewin </PERSON> is weak and depends heavily on testimony from other potential suspects who may be lying to protect themselves. <PERSON> Griffiths </PERSON>, 36, was killed by a bullet shot through a door that he was trying to break down to execute a drug search warrant. By the time his partners got through the steel-reinforced door, the third-floor apartment was empty. They rushed down a back staircase and found <PERSON> Lewin </PERSON> and six other people in an apartment on the first floor. Charges were later dropped against the others in return for damaging testimony against <PERSON> Lewin </PERSON>. A weakness in the prosecution's case from the outset was that <PERSON> Lewin </PERSON> did not match the search warrant's description of the cocaine dealer police said occupied the apartment and presumably fired the fatal shot. An informant named <PERSON> John </PERSON> tipped detectives that drugs were being sold from the apartment by a 5-foot-6 inch Hispanic man, according to the police application for the warrant. <PERSON> Lewin </PERSON> is 6-foot-2 and Jamaican. After the judge ordered the detectives last year to bring the informant into court, they said they could n't find him. In throwing out the case last month, <PERSON> Grabau </PERSON> said he believed the police had intentionally disobeyed his orders to produce the witness. But in a stunning turnaround last week, the detectives admitted <PERSON> John </PERSON> did not exist. According to the affidavits, the information attributed to <PERSON> John </PERSON> actually came from two other informants, identified in court only as `` Y'' and `` Z.'' <PERSON> O'Meara </PERSON> said Monday the detectives created <PERSON> John </PERSON> to protect their real informants. `` When the playing field is not level, when it's skewed, when it's fixed, then the -LRB- court -RRB- system ca n't work,'' <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> said. `` That's what you have here.'' <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> also said the detectives obtained at least 30 other warrants and conducted drug raids using information attributed to `` <PERSON> John </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenthal </PERSON>, a staff member for the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Counsel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, said Sunday that defense lawyers are now examining many of those cases and are likely to file motions for new trials. Where faulty warrants led to arrests and convictions, he said, convicted dealers could go free under a rule that bars evidence obtained through police misconduct. <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Silverglate </PERSON>, co-chairman of the 320-member <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lawyers </ORGANIZATION>, said the <PERSON> Lewin </PERSON> case has revealed what many lawyers suspected all along. `` Anybody who practices criminal law here can tell you that we have great skepticism about these warrants,'' <PERSON> Silverglate </PERSON> said.

 An ammonia tank exploded at a factory in <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> on Monday, killing at least two people and injuring 41, state media said. The blast released a cloud of gas into the air that was being pushed eastward by the wind, but officials said it was unlikely that any populated areas would have to be evacuated. A government commission was formed to investigate the cause of the blast at the <LOCATION> Azot </LOCATION> factory in <LOCATION> Ionava </LOCATION>, about 45 miles northwest of the Lithuanian capital of <LOCATION> Vilnius </LOCATION>, the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency said. The tank contained about 7,000 cubic meters of ammonia. It took firefighters several hours to put out blazes that broke out, and an unspecified number of people were evacuated near the plant, <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>'s Deputy Premier Y.L. <PERSON> Rusenko </PERSON> told Soviet television. `` I think that the concentration will not be increased because all the ammonium has practially been evaporated above Ionava,'' he said. `` If it is necessary people will be evacuated in other regions, if a cloud approaches and the concentration is high. But I think the danger has passed,'' <PERSON> Rusenko </PERSON> said. Residents were warned about the explosion and the release of ammonia by official radio after the late morning explosion, he said. Without being specific, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said that security had been tightened. Residents of <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> and the other Soviet Baltic republics of <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> are concerned about environmental damage caused by the heavy concentration of industry in the almost 50 years since they were absorbed into the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Many people blame the central government in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for ordering the heavy industrialization without showing concern for environmental damage.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sales of farm products to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> will reach $ 8.2 billion to $ 8.3 billion this year, topping sales to <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> for the first time, a federal official told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> Monday. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports to the 12 countries of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> are expected to drop to $ 7.3 billion for the year ending Sept. 30, said Administrator <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. For all of <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, which includes such non-members of the community as <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, total <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sales are expected to reach $ 7.8 billion. In the year that ended last Sept. 30, exports to the 12 <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> countries reached $ 7.5 billion, against $ 7.3 billion to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kay </PERSON>, testifying at a hearing of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on <ORGANIZATION> Rural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, said he agreed with the panel's acting chairman, Rep. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Akaka </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Hawaii </LOCATION>, that the biggest gains for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farm sales are coming from the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> countries He noted that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is now the biggest importer of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat, and he predicted big increases in exports to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, which are rising to $ 2.5 billion this year from $ 2.3 billion. `` We are transferring our resources to that area _ that's where the future lies,'' <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sims </PERSON>, general sales manager at the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, said this will be the last year in which <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> will get loans supported by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government to encourage its purchases. <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> reported that in less than six months since Oct. 1, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has announced nearly $ 4.8 billion worth of guaranteed loans to 23 countries, almost as much as in the 12 previous months. <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farmers `` love'' subsidies for sales abroad. The program has increased their prices and reduced the surplus of farm products, he explained. In testimony submitted to the subcommittee, <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> said total <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports this year are due to rise to $ 38 billion, up $ 2.7 billion from 1988. He attributed the increase to higher prices because of last summer's s drought. The volume of farm exports is due to drop by 2 percent.

 <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s 84-year-old leader, was conspicuous by his absence from Friday's opening of the nation's annual legislative session As the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> opened, Western reporters sitting in the balcony of the huge Great Hall of the People clutched their binoculars and scanned the dais for the country's senior statesman. They came up empty. An official from the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> would say only that <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> had `` asked for leave'' from the conference. <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> <PERSON> Yun </PERSON>, another elderly leader who heads the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, had done the same, she said. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> attended the opening last year's opening session as a delegate from <LOCATION> Sichuan </LOCATION> province. He sat between <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON> and Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>. This year, President <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Shangkun </PERSON> took <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s seat. No empty seats appeared to have been set aside for the man who fathered <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s current economic reforms in 1978. Two seats were empty on the left side of the dais, not traditionally the places for high-ranking officials. Although he remains the power behind party and state in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> officially only has charge of the military. As the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> does not report directly to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, his presence at the meeting is not mandatory. Still, <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s absence and the reaction it created among members of the Western press illustrates one of the difficulties of understanding Chinese politics. Much here is done for effect, but often it is difficult to tell what the desired effect is. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> last was seen Friday when he greeted Thai Prime Minister <PERSON> Chatichai </PERSON> <PERSON> Choonhavan </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. He appeared spry and remarked that <PERSON> Chatichai </PERSON> had played golf with <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> the day before. `` I'm also a sportsman,'' <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> said. `` I play bridge.''

 It's easier to buy and register a handgun in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> than to apply for a driver's license, two lawmakers said Monday in proposing a package of laws to keep better track of weapons and their owners. Residents now can obtain a Firearm Owner's Identification Card by mail. The card is valid for five years and allows its possessor to keep as many weapons of any kind as desired without reporting the total number or serial numbers. Under the legislation proposed by Democratic state Sens. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Marovitz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Rock </PERSON>, owners would have to get separate ID cards for each handgun, and fill out the applications at a local law enforcement agency. The card would be good for three years, and applicants would have to furnish more detailed personal history than currently required. <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> police <PERSON> Supterintendent </PERSON> <PERSON> LeRoy </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s crime rate dipped last year and said his force's confiscation of 14,000 weapons had a significant effect. `` Over 50 percent of the 14,000 ca n't be identified,'' he said. `` If we could trace them, it would make a big difference. We know people are buying the guns and selling them or renting them to gangs, and this would enable us to follow some of the weapons back to the source.'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Zangrilli </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors, objected to the legislation Many states and localities have taken steps limiting gun sales or possession in recent weeks.

<TEXT>
 West German authorities Monday warned businesses and public institutions that Soviet intelligence has obtained passwords and codes to gain access into their computers. A statement by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said the codes apparently were passed to the Soviet <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> by three West German `` hackers'' arrested this month. The three are suspected of selling thousands of codes and passwords from Western military and research computers to Soviet intelligence agents. Police authorities investigating the case have determined that the hackers allegedly planned to break into or succeeded in breaking into many other computers, the statement said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> is capable of gaining full access to computer data of businesses and public institutions,'' it added. It said obtaining computer codes and passwords has become a `` new type of espionage by the East.'' When the three were arrested, authorities said they had cracked a major spy ring and warned of a new dimension in Soviet-bloc espionage.

<HEAD>Former Rep. Barnes Says Casey Tried to Discredit House Staffer</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Adds 6 grafs at end with North-congressmen meeting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
 Former Rep. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> testified Monday that former <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> tried to discredit a congressional committee staff member at a time the panel was investigating <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s efforts on behalf of Nicaraguan rebels. `` He indicated that a member of my staff had met with a representative of the Nicaraguan government,'' said <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> Democrat. The <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> said, found out about the meeting by intercepting a conversation between the <LOCATION> Nicaraguan </LOCATION> ambassador and that country's foreign minister. <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> identified the staff member as <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, who was staff director of the subcommittee on Western Hemisphere Affairs. At the time, in late 1985 when official aid to the Nicaraguan rebels was forbidden by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law, <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>' subcommittee was trying to pry information from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> on its activities. His voice rising, the former congressman strongly denied there was anything wrong with <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s contact with the Nicaraguan government. `` My memory of what <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> said is that a member of my staff had met with a representative of the Nicaraguan government,'' said <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>. `` He told them if they were to improve the human rights situation in their country, lifting martial law, restoring freedom of the press ... such steps could be of help to members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> trying to reject aid to the Contras.'' `` Did he indicate to you the staff member gave classified information?'' asked <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyer. `` No sir,'' <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> said. `` I found the allegation he made basically to be frivolous. He did n't allege a member of my staff was passing classified information to the Nicaraguan government. On the contrary, from what he told me, my staff was doing what it had routinely done. `` I told him in my judgment, based on what he told me, that what this individual had done was perfectly appropriate.'' <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> died in early 1987. <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>, who left his <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> seat to make an unsuccessful try for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 1986, said after meeting with <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> he told the chairman of the full Foreign Affairs committee about the conversation and `` he agreed the meeting was appropriate.'' The former <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> congressman told <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> heatedly: `` There was never any allegation that <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> or any other member of my staff had provided classified information in any form to the Nicaraguan government or any other government.'' <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>, one of the leaders against aid to the Contras, also testified Monday that then-National Security Adviser <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> had seemed `` very nervous'' about the questions being raised about <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s activities. <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> said he was dissatisfied with a Sept. 12, 1985, letter from <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> denying that <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> staffers were raising money and offering tactical advice to the guerrillas fighting the leftist Nicaraguan government. They met in <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> office and <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> offered to let <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> _ but no congressional staffers _ examine documents relating to the Contras. North, who was on <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>'s staff, is being tried on charges that he obstructed <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and made false statements in connection with the Sept. 12 letter and two others written in 1985. `` Were you aware that <PERSON> North </PERSON> collaborated with Mr. <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> on writing that letter?'' prosecutor <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Bromwich </PERSON> asked. `` No,'' <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> said. He said that in a later letter to <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> and in the face-to-face meeting, he requested all documents relating to communications between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> government and the Contras. `` I felt that Mr. <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> was very concerned about our investigation, very nervous about it,'' <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> said he rejected <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>'s offer to let him alone look at the documents, saying it was always necessary in such cases to have knowledgeable congressional staffers examine them. The next witness after <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Latimer </PERSON>, staff director of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, testified about attempts by his committee chairman in September 1986 to follow continuing reports that the <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> was violating the prohibition against helping the Contras. <PERSON> Latimer </PERSON> set up an Aug. 6 meeting between <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> and the committee in the White House. North spoke for 40-45 minutes, he said, denying again that he had violated the law. `` He was asked specifically if he had given any miitary advice to the Contras,'' <PERSON> Latimer </PERSON> said. `` He said he had not. He was asked if he was involved in any fund-raising. He said he had not.'' One of the obstruction-of-Congress charges against <PERSON> North </PERSON> is based on his answers at that meeting. Under the ground rules set by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, no transcript was made but the prosecution introduced the notes that <PERSON> Latimer </PERSON> made at the time. They reflected that <PERSON> North </PERSON> said he had explained the Boland amendment restrictions to the Contra but `` never violated stricture'' and merely `` gave advice on human rights, civic action programs.'' Testimony at the trial has indicated that <PERSON> North </PERSON> made many speeches to potential donors to the Contra cause, although he left the pitches for money to others, and that he gave extensive advice to the Nicaraguan rebels.

<TEXT>
 Diplomats and ministers from 111 nations met Monday for a U.N.-sponsored toxic waste conference to culminate in a treaty regulating international trafficking of dangerous products. But African delegations demanded alterations in the 51-page draft document and threatened to stall the three-day meeting. If approved, the treaty formally gives all signing countries the right to refuse imports of hazardous wastes and requires exporters to provide prospective recipients details of shipments. Signatories will pledge to dispose of dangerous waste in an environmentally sound way and also will commit to keep international toxic waste traffic to a minimum. <PERSON> Mostafa </PERSON> <PERSON> Tolba </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION>, said international hazardous waste trade is threatening public health and the environment. At least 100,000 shipments of toxic waste crosses international borders annually in a `` commerce of poison'' worth billions of dollars, <PERSON> Tolba </PERSON> told delegates at the opening session. <PERSON> Tolba </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Basel </LOCATION> treaty would signal the end of uncontrolled hazardous waste transport. But <LOCATION> Mali </LOCATION>'s environment minister, <PERSON> Morifing </PERSON> <PERSON> Kone </PERSON>, speaking for the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unity </ORGANIZATION>, said the treaty contains gaps. He said some African nations want a guarantee that industrialized countries wo n't use developing areas as a dumping ground for poisonous wastes. <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION>, the international environmental group, on Monday criticized the treaty for not covering radioactive waste and allowing member countries to sign waste trade pacts with non-member nations. The problem of international trafficking in dangerous wastes was dramatized last year when several waste shipments from industrialized countries were found dumped in African nations, including <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION>. Waste-laden ships traveled from port to port looking for a place to dispose of their cargo. Environmentalists said they were concerned that importing toxic waste had become a source of income for poor countries with no safe disposal plans. <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s attention was drawn to the problem earlier when barrels of toxic waste from <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Seveso </LOCATION> chemical plant spill vanished in 1982 before turning up months later in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. The incident led to the adoption of European Community rules on cross-border dangerous waste transport.

<HEAD>Two Police Officers Found Dead near Border</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The bodies of two high-ranking police officers were found Monday in a car near the border with the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, authorities said. Unconfirmed reports said both were shot. No group immediately claimed responsibility for the deaths, which follow a series of retaliatory slayings by <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> and Roman Catholic extremists. On Sunday, gunmen stormed a <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> home and killed a man while he said his prayers with his wife. <PERSON> Eamonn </PERSON> <PERSON> Mallie </PERSON>, a reporter for <ORGANIZATION> Downtown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, said the slain officers were a constabulary divisional commander and his deputy. The constabulary said only that both victims were high-ranking officers, and there was no immediate report on the cause of death. The constabulary said the car was found near <LOCATION> Jonesborough </LOCATION>, just inside the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> province of <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. The area was sealed off and the area was searched by helicopter before police and troops moved in. <PERSON> Seamus </PERSON> <PERSON> Mallon </PERSON>, an opposition member of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, said the deaths of the two officers were `` a calculated and brutal act of slaughter carried out by people for whom murder has become a way of life.'' Northern Ireland Secretary <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> pledged that the security forces would take `` every possible step'' to combat the wave of retaliatory murders. King, the British <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> minister responsible for <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, discussed the violence Monday with deputy police chief <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> McAtamney </PERSON> of the Royal Ulster Constabulary. `` What the <ORGANIZATION> RUC </ORGANIZATION> and all the security forces need at this time is the full support of the whole community in a total rejection of violence and a maximum public alertness and vigilance against these evil groups,'' he said afterwards. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Braniff </PERSON>, 63 and a father of 13, was shot dead in his north <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> home Sunday night. Neighbors said two gunmen burst into <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION>'s house and shot him at point-blank range. They said he died with his rosary in his hands. Police appealed to the public to help find <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION>'s killers. No group immediately claimed responsibility. <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>, was a bricklayer who had been a <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> before he married. He had British flags tattooed on his arms and worked in Protestant areas of <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>. On Friday, <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> civil servant <PERSON> Niall </PERSON> <PERSON> Davies </PERSON>, 42, was shot in his home, apparently in retaliation for the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> killing the previous night of <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Irvine </PERSON>, 49, a former commander of the <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> paramilitary <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Volunteer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>. The latest round of killings began Feb. 12 when <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Finucane </PERSON> was shot in his home. The Protestant underground <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fighters </ORGANIZATION> said they killed him because he was an <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> officer. His widow denied it. The mainly <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> is fighting to end British rule in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and unite the province with the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> to the south, while the <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> majority wants to remain under the British flag.

<TEXT>
 A massive stockpile of government-owned grain and other commodities has been reduced to about half what it was a year ago, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported Monday. The department's <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which handles price support operations, said the value of products under its control as of Dec. 31 totaled $ 15.8 billion, down from $ 29.6 billion a year earlier. Under CCC programs, when a crop is placed by farmers under price support loan, the commodity can not be sold or used by producers until the loan is settled. In many cases, when market prices fail to rise enough to make it worthwhile to pay off the loans, farmers forfeit the commodity to the CCC, which then holds it as `` inventory'' or surplus. As of Dec. 31, the <ORGANIZATION> CCC </ORGANIZATION> had loans outstanding on $ 11 billion worth of commodities and held $ 4.8 billion in its inventories. A year earlier, CCC holdings were $ 17.3 billion and $ 12.3 billion, respectively. Last year's drought, which cut production sharply, helped force up market prices and ease the CCC load. Overseas demand also has been a factor. Domestic use and also higher market prices or changes in program policies have been other reasons. In the case of corn and other feed grains, for example, the Dec. 31 total held by CCC was about 2.36 billion bushels valued at $ 7.77 billion, including both loans and inventory. A year earlier feed grains totaled 7.52 billion bushels worth $ 16.7 billion. The Dec. 31 wheat total was less than 768 million bushels valued at $ 2.69 billion, down from 1.77 billion bushels worth $ 5.99 billion a year earlier. Holdings of dairy products bought by CCC to support the price of milk paid to farmers totaled 454.7 million pounds valued at $ 602.2 million, compared with 1.16 billion pounds and $ 1.43 billion a year earlier.

<HEAD>Opposition Wants Takeshita Out; Government Counting on Reform</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Opposition parties said Monday that local elections show voters want Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s government to quit, but the ruling party said political reform would win back the people's confidence. Chief government spokesman <PERSON> Keizo </PERSON> <PERSON> Obuchi </PERSON> dismissed opposition calls for general elections, saying Sunday's ballot `` was a gubernatorial election to select the governor and not a referendum.'' The ruling <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> candidate narrowly defeated a communist contender to win the governorship of <LOCATION> Chiba </LOCATION> province neighboring <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. Newspapers said Monday the result showed waning support for the party, which is embroiled in an insider trading scandal. Its bruised image suffered more when it pushed an unwelcome 3 percent sales tax through parliament in December. Together, they have driven <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s popularity to a record 15 percent low, according to <ORGANIZATION> Asahi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s second largest newspaper. Three Cabinet ministers have resigned and 12 bureaucrats and businessman have been arrested in the stock-profiteering scandal involving <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> has refused to call new elections But elections are scheduled in July for half of the bicameral <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>'s House of Councilors, where <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> hold 143 of the 251 seats. Large losses there would endanger <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s chances in October to win another two-year term as party president and prime minister. `` From now on, our party will promote political reform and strive to revive the confidence of the people in government,'' said <PERSON> Shintaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Abe </PERSON>, secretary-general of the ruling party, following Sunday's vote. He called <PERSON> Takeshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Numata </PERSON>'s narrow victory a positive sign residents were prepared to support the party despite the scandal. But the opposition noted <PERSON> Numata </PERSON> defeated communist <PERSON> Shoji </PERSON> <PERSON> Ishii </PERSON> by only 971,687 votes to 786,238 votes, compared with a 1985 victory of 781,000 votes to 271,000 votes over another communist candidate. In a second gubernatorial race Sunday, for <PERSON> Miyagi </PERSON> prefecture, Socialist <PERSON> Shuntaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Honma </PERSON> easily won with 502,372 votes. His nearest rival was conservative independent <PERSON> Seiki </PERSON> <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON>, with 140,979 votes. <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidate <PERSON> Kazuo </PERSON> <PERSON> Aichi </PERSON> had withdrawn earlier after admitting he received more than $ 60,000 from Recruit, the information conglomerate also accused of bribing legislators in a bid to bury the scandal. Recruit offered bargain-priced unlisted stock in a subsidiary to more than 150 influential politicians and businessmen in 1986. Recipients made handsome profits once public trading in the shares began later that year. Calling for new national elections, <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> opposition leader <PERSON> Tsuruo </PERSON> <PERSON> Yamaguchi </PERSON> said, `` The election results are substantiated by the latest public polls by the media and clearly show that the <ORGANIZATION> Takeshita </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> has lost its ability to govern.'' The Communist Party said: `` The people are united ... in calling for the early dissolution of the <ORGANIZATION> Takeshita </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> and the holding of a general election.'' <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s biggest newspaper, the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Yomiuri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION>, commented, `` In <LOCATION> Chiba </LOCATION> in particular, where the number of votes obtained by the communists grew substantially, voters distinctly showed their irritation and rage regarding the Recruit problem.'' The ruling party also was stung last month when it lost a parliamentary by-election in <LOCATION> Fukuoka </LOCATION> prefecture to a candidate supported by its biggest rival, the Socialists. The Liberal Democrats have ruled <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> since World War II with the exception of 10 months of Socialist government in 1947-48.

 Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> told a college audience Monday that <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state must show leadership in this `` hour of fright'' and then vetoed the latest legislation that would restore the death penalty. Before issuing his seventh consecutive veto, <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> defended his opposition to the death penalty before a rally of about 400 people at <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rose </ORGANIZATION>. He again urged lawmakers to approve his alternative of life without parole for some murderers. `` The people of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> ought now in this hour of fright to show the way,'' <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said. `` We should refuse to allow this time to be marked forever in the pages of history as a time that we were driven back to one of the vestiges of our primitive condition because we were not strong enough ... to find a better end to the violence.'' It was the opening salvo of what is expected to be an intense legislative battle. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> is one of 13 states without an operable death penalty law. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, which introduced the electric chair to the world in 1890, has not executed anyone since 1963. With a crack epidemic and its accompanying violence sweeping through <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, supporters of the death penalty in the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> claim they'll have enough votes to override <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>'s veto An override attempt is expected in June. `` I know that this society should strive for something better than we are in our worst moments,'' <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said. `` It is n't easy for people to hold back their anger ... but that is the only rational course.'' <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said there's no persuasive evidence the death penalty deters murderers. He said most would be more frightened by the thought of spending the rest of their lives in prison. Both houses of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> have already approved the latest death penalty bill, for the 13th consecutive year. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> has vetoed the legislation every year he's been in office, as did former Gov. <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Carey </PERSON> in the six years before that.

 Gunmen killed 17 Sinhalese men in a shooting spree in north-central <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>, and Indian troops shot and killed 12 Tamil rebels in separate weekend clashes, witnesses and the military said Monday. Residents of Tirappane village said on condition of anonymity that the Sinhalese victims were shot and then hacked to death Sunday by unidentified assailants. Also on Sunday, Sinhalese rebels were blamed for seven other deaths, military officials said. The motive behind the Tirappane killings was not immediately known, but residents said the murders may be linked to the assassination of three policemen by Sinhalese radicals in a nearby village earlier Sunday. The policemen were killed when Sinhalese rebels detonated explosives by remote control and blew up a jeep at <LOCATION> Epawalla </LOCATION> <LOCATION> village </LOCATION>, about 15 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Anuradhapura </LOCATION> town. Police said an organization known as the `` Black Cats'' may be responsible for the Tirappane murders. The group's aim is to eliminate supporters of the radical Sinhalese group known as the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, police said. The Sinhalese Front is opposed to the government's peace offers to Tamil rebels. Sinhalese radicals also killed four people on Sunday in <LOCATION> Kaduwela </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> suburb. Elsewhere, six Tamil rebels were killed when they tried to ambush an Indian patrol in northern <LOCATION> Jaffna </LOCATION>, 185 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>. Six more rebels were killed in a second clash with <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> soldiers in <LOCATION> Mullaitivu </LOCATION> district, about 170 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has an estimated 40,000 troops in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> to enforce a peace accord aimed at ending the Tamil guerrilla war for an independent homeland in the north and east, where they predominate.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> urged members of the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> on Monday to reject the leadership's list of candidates for the new Soviet legislature, which does not include the Nobel Peace Prize winner. The 67-year-old nuclear physicist and human rights activist, who won the Nobel in 1975, said in a speech to the academy that many scientists objected to the slate for Sunday's election approved by the leadership in January. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> and several other well-known proponents of reform are missing from the list. The official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> quoted him as saying, however, that scientists were upset `` not because <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> was not nominated, but because the role of scientific institutions was ignored.'' He called for reversal of what he called the anti-democratic decision, which produced a list of what critics describe as old-guard managers of scientific institutions. A vote on the academy candidates is scheduled for Tuesday. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> was nominated from several geographic districts for a seat in the new 2,250-member <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, but he decided to refuse the nominations and fight for an Academy of Sciences seat. Under an election law approved in December, 750 seats in the legislature are reserved for the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and its affiliates and for professional, social and trade union organizations. The other 1,500 will be filled by representatives of the 15 Soviet republics and their electoral districts. Those in the academy who support <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> hope to force a new round of nominations by mustering enough support to deny all nominees a majority, said <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Mironov </PERSON>, a former political prisoner. That would force the academy to start over and produce a new list of nominees under terms of the new election law. Twenty-five seats were allotted to the academy, but it gave five to affiliated societies and associations. From 121 nominees, the academy leadership chose 23 candidates for the remaining 20 seats. Although 60 research institutes nominated <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, he was not chosen for the final slate. The leadership's decision inspired widespread press criticism and a demonstration at the academy's <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> headquarters <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said 1,108 academicians, corresponding members and representatives of reseach institutes attended the three-day meeting that began Monday. `` The first three days of this week may become the ` hottest' spring days for Soviet scientists,'' it said, alluding to the leadership's rejection of such reformers as <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, space scientist <PERSON> Roald </PERSON> <PERSON> Sagdeev </PERSON> and sociologist <PERSON> Tatyana </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaslavsakaya </PERSON> The agency acknowledged `` many scientists were unsatisfied'' with the slate of candidates. <PERSON> Mironov </PERSON> said two other academicians also spoke on Monday in favor of new nominations. No details of their remarks were available.

 Residential telephone users feel they're receiving about the same quality of service they got before the breakup of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, and business customers think their service has improved, according to a federal analysis of phone company surveys The percentage of residential customers who reported they were satisfied with their phone service climbed from about 93.1 percent to about 94.1 percent from 1985 to June 1988, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> concluded. Small business user satisfaction increased from about 91.6 percent in 1985 to near 94.2 percent in the first half of 1988, the most recent period for which figures are available, the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> said. Large business user satisfaction climbed from about 90.3 percent in 1985 to 94.7 percent in mid-1988, the commission said. `` Residence customer perceptions have not changed significantly since 1985, while business perceptions have noticeably improved,'' it said. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> study, released last week, was based upon semiannual reports the commission has required the seven `` Baby Bell'' companies to file in the wake of the 1984 <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T divestiture. The <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> company reports were broken down into five broad categories for analysis: customer satisfaction, dial tone delay, transmission quality, on time service orders, and equipment failure and blocking. `` In the areas of customer perception, transmission quality and dial tone speed, the companies generally improved since 1985. ... The companies do show some decline with respect to on time service ... performance for residential customers,'' the report said. The percentage of customers satisfied with dial tone speed -LRB- a connection within three seconds -RRB- rose from about 97.6 percent in 1985 to nearly 98.9 percent in 1988. Transmission quality satisfaction climbed from about 89.9 percent to 94.5 percent. However, on time service order satisfaction for residential users fell from 98.1 percent in 1985 to 97 percent in June 1988, the report said. The report covered the local phone companies operated by <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> BellSouth </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> NYNEX </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Telesis </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ameritech </ORGANIZATION>. The commission cautioned that data collected from state public utilities commissions may be more detailed and that the data should not be used to compare companies. `` The individual reports provided by the companies tend to obscure trends since the indices almost always register over 90 percent,'' the commission said.

<TEXT>
 The recent spurt of inflation is raising fears of a recession, with some economists predicting Monday that a downturn could begin in the second half of 1989. These analysts believe that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>, faced with alarming news of increasing price pressures, will squeeze credit so tightly that an economic slump will be all but inevitable. `` Once you get inflation up to the levels we have right now, it has taken a recession to cool things off. That is an unfortunate fact of life,'' said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, senior economist at the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investment firm of <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION>. Inflation worries were heightened last Friday when the government reported that prices at the wholesale level had shot up a full percentage point for the second straight month. It was the worst back-to-back inflation news in nearly eight years and it sent stock and bond prices plunging as investors worried that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> would be forced to drive interest rates higher in an effort to dampen demand. Markets continued to be battered by inflation worries on Monday, with the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average of 30 stocks falling 29.64 points to close at 2,262.50, after a 48.57 point drop on Friday, the worst one-day loss in nearly a year. Investors were braced for an even bigger market drop Tuesday if the government's monthly check of consumer prices comes in with a worse-than-expected number. Economists were looking for consumer prices to rise by about 0.5 percent in February. They feared that a figure as high as 0.7 percent could send markets into a tailspin. Even a 0.5 percent increase would translate into an annual advance above 6 percent, sharply higher than the price increases of 4.4 percent or less during the past seven years. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration sought to play down inflation worries on Monday with <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> telling reporters that a number of recent business reports paint a picture of a slowing economy which will be enough to break any inflationary pressures. But private ecoomists said fears were now so widespread that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> will be forced to take actions that will likely send a variety of consumer and business interest rates higher. `` We are looking at potentially the worst inflationary bout since the late 1970s and early 1980s,'' said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` It is a policy problem of immense proportions for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> and it will require sharply higher interest rates and potentially a recession to deal with.'' Starting a year ago, the central bank, under Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, began gradually nudging interest rates higher in an effort to keep inflation from getting out of control. Some economists complained that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> was too tentative, especially in the second half of 1988, and now is faced with the need to slam on the brakes. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Aubrey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lanston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a government securities dealer, predicted that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> would boost the discount rate, the rate it charges to make loans to financial institutions, two or more times in coming months. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> increased the discount rate to 7 percent on Feb. 24 in a move widely seen as a signal that it intended to move more strongly against inflationary pressures. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> gave up on gradualism in February,'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. `` Now that they have become tougher and more aggressive, it makes the danger of a recession greater.'' Both <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON> said they were now forecasting recessions. The <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> forecast calls for a mild downturn to begin in the July-September quarter this year while <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON> said he was not looking for a downturn until early next year. However, other economists, while forecasting slower growth, said there was still a chance that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> would be able to achieve its hoped for `` soft landing'' where growth slows enough to ease inflationary pressures but not enough to mean an end to the six-year-long economic recovery from the severe 1981-82 recsssion. `` A recession occurs when businesses get nervous and start laying off people. I do n't see that happening,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, head of a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> forecasting firm. `` Businessmen are still optimistic and they are holding on to their qualified employees.'' But the Shadow Open Market Committee, a group of economists who monitor <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> actions, released a report Monday saying that the central bank had `` increased the risk of a recession'' by its recent actions. Politicians are worried as well. Six Republican senators last week signed a letter complaining about the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s inflation-fighting efforts. `` If the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> persists in tightening credit and raising interest rates, we fear it will sow the seeds of a recession,'' said the letter, signed by <PERSON> Sens </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasten </PERSON>, R-Wis.; <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Nickles </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Okla </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Symms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Idaho </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Fla </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> Trent </PERSON> <PERSON> Lott </PERSON>, R-Miss., and <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON>

 Four black detainees on a hunger strike escaped Monday from a <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> hospital, fled 38 miles to <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> and took refuge at the West German Embassy there, officials said. The four men, who were held without charge for between 10 months and 23 months, demanded that the government guarantee that they and all other political detainees will be freed. `` We have committed no crime,'' the escapees said in a statement. `` We have been kept in detention for so long that we felt we had to embark on a life-and-death hunger strike to dramatize our plight in detention and to ultimately secure our immediate release.'' West German Embassy Counselor <PERSON> Klaus </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonnemann </PERSON> said Monday night, `` They can stay and we will not make them leave against their will.'' He said the men will have access to medical treatment if needed. Hundreds of detainees have taken part in hunger strikes since January, demanding to be released or put on trial. The government says it freed more than 400 detainees in the past month and that about 350 remain in custody. An estimated 30,000 people have been held without charge for varying lengths of time since the state of emergency was imposed 33 months ago. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Pik </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said his government is in contact with the West Germans, and the matter was `` receiving attention.'' <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> did not say what actions <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> plans. The men said through the Detainees Aid Center that they belong to organizations affiliated with the banned <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, the country's largest anti-apartheid coalition. They identified themselves as <PERSON> Job </PERSON> <PERSON> Sithole </PERSON>, 21, <PERSON> Ephraim </PERSON> <PERSON> Nkoe </PERSON>, 28, <PERSON> Mpho </PERSON> <PERSON> Lekgoro </PERSON>, 24, and <PERSON> Clive </PERSON> <PERSON> Radebe </PERSON>, 28. All are from the townships around <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> and have been active in various youth and student organizations, their statement said. By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which the 28 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services. The men did not disclose how they escaped from the hospital and got to the West German Embassy. But lawyer <PERSON> Priscilla </PERSON> <PERSON> Jana </PERSON>, who met the men Monday evening, told the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> the four took a taxi from the hospital to the embassy. Journalists were not allowed inside the embassy, but from the gates four black men clad in T-shirts and jeans could be seen standing in the foyer of the building. The embassy, surrounded by 13-foot high walls, is less than a half-mile from <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Buildings </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s administrative capital. People have escaped from South African custody and taken refuge in foreign diplomatic missions several times in recent years. Most recently, three detainees escaped from a hospital in September and holed up in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Consulate in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> for more than 40 days before deciding to leave. The South African government promised the three men, all <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> members, would not be detained or restricted once they left the consulate. The three have spoken regularly on behalf of the organization in recent months. In another incident, <PERSON> Klaas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Jonge </PERSON>, a Dutch citizen accused of smuggling weapons for the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla movement, took refuge in the Dutch Consulate in <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> for more than two years before he was returned to the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> in September 1987 in an exchange involving prisoners in four countries.

 <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON> <PERSON> Burton </PERSON>, 11, shivering in a cold wind on the first day of spring, sang the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anthem </ORGANIZATION> at an empty <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> Stadium better than three other children and 29 adults Monday and won the right to sing it again _ with the sun presumably warmer and the stands fuller. The girl from the <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Cockeysville </LOCATION> won an audition to sing `` The Star-Spangled Banner'' on April 2, the day before the baseball season begins for real, at an exhibition game between the <ORGANIZATION> Baltimore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orioles </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cardinals </ORGANIZATION>, two foreign teams named after birds. The nation's capital has been without a team since the second set of Senators headed west, to <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, in 1972. That version of the Senators had been created as an expansion club by baseball's rulers in 1961 to fill the void when the first Senators skipped town for <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION>, wearing a bow in her hair and braces on her teeth, said she was nervous but not at all worried about forgetting the words. She said she had known the words by heart for years. Her mother, <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Burton </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON> started singing even before she learned to walk. She recalled that when <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON> was in the second grade, her teacher called and said, `` I've got to talk to you about your daughter.'' `` I thought she'd done something terrible,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> said. `` But when I went to school, he said, ` She's got this remarkable voice. We've got to do something about it.''' <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON> joined the <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> Children's Chorus. She also sings at dinner theaters and, her mother said, at every opportunity. For several hours, the national anthem echoed in the empty stadium. Contestants sat in high-priced seats along the first base line awaiting the chance to stand at a microphone behind home plate and sing. Among them were <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON>, 57, needing a shave, just off the nightshift at the <LOCATION> Merrifield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, who carried the words on a card in his pocket `` just in case my mind went blank''; <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Strude </PERSON>, an air conditioning refrigeration combusion engineer who sings in the choir of the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bapist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> and does `` most of my singing for the Lord''; Cub Scout <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Foy </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Laurel </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, son of a computer whiz at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>; and <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Chance </PERSON>, an editorial assistant for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> who said she was `` late for work even as we speak.''

 <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> used his own commercial success and public discontent with a long civil war to overcome his party's image of an ultra-right movement linked to death squads. <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>, who claimed victory in Sunday's presidential election, says his <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> party, known as <PERSON> Arena </PERSON>, is a political force no one can ignore. Arena was founded by <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> d'Aubuisson </PERSON>, a former army major frequently accused of organizing right-wing death squads, and many people wonder whether <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> runs the party or is a figurehead for d'Aubuisson. Before the election, <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government `` can not dismiss'' his party `` in the simplistic manner it did in the past.'' `` We consider the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> our natural ally, but it can not come and impose models or conditions,'' said <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>, who attended <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administrations have criticized <PERSON> d'Aubuisson </PERSON>, who was dismissed from the army in 1980 on grounds of plotting a coup. The party founder denies the allegations against him. <PERSON> D'Aubuisson </PERSON> formed the party in 1981. It has gained popularity in recent years and it won a slim legislative majority in 1988, which puts it in the position of controlling both the legislative and executive branches. <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>, a 41-year-old coffee farmer and distributor of medical supplies, appealed in the campaign to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s traditionally conservative middle and upper classes, and to others tired of a 9-year-old war that has taken more than 70,000 lives. `` I'd rather be sitting in my office'' than running for president,'' he said in a pre-election interview. `` I am here because I am convinced that my country can progress if we are free in every sense of the word and adopt an economic model for development.'' At his side throughout the campaign was d'Aubuisson, stirring up the crowds at rallies. <PERSON> D'Aubuisson </PERSON> lost the 1984 presidential election to <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Democrat </PERSON> <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>. <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>, a member of Arena since 1982, became the party president in 1985 when <PERSON> d'Aubuisson </PERSON> stopped down from that post. <PERSON> D'Aubuisson </PERSON> is currently an Arena representative in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> and is still referred to by many party members as `` maximum leader.'' <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>, who has not been linked to the death squads, was elected to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> in 1985 and re-elected last year. In a recent interview by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Christiani </PERSON> was asked why <PERSON> d'Aubuisson </PERSON> had quit as <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> president. `` He recognized that his figure and all that had been said about him was prejudicial to the party's image,'' he said. <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> also commented on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and d'Aubuisson. `` <PERSON> D'Aubuisson </PERSON> personally can not expect the support of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` Even if he were to be born again his image could not be changed there. They damaged it so much beyond salvation.'' <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> blames <PERSON> Arena </PERSON>'s image problem on the foreign news media _ especially the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> media. He also has criticized the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government for what he calls the `` distortion'' of <PERSON> Arena </PERSON>'s image. <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> is a tall, angular man with a soft voice, graying moustache and hair combed straight back, an exemplar of the economic class that blames the military and politicians of the past for the nation's ills. `` We may be conservative,'' he said of <PERSON> Arena </PERSON>, `` but we are the only party that has defined the social problems of the country and that offers a solution.'' He said President <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>, barred by the consitution from seeking re-election, failed to end the war and solve economic problems. `` We must have a clear economic model _ a free market _ that benefits all sectors of society; avoid protectionism, -LRB- and -RRB- let the government take care only of those services where private business will not enter,'' he said. Peace is a `` viable probablity'' if leftist guerrillas join the democratic process, he said. If they do n't, the alternative is `` efficient, professional use of the armed forces, but we would rather sit down and talk about a national peace proposal so we all may re-enter a peaceful life,'' <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> declared. `` Some objectives have been achieved and the main thing is that all political parties are participating in the election.'' <PERSON> Ana </PERSON> <PERSON> Guadalupe </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, a member of the rebel political commission, said in an interview in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> is on the `` rational'' right but she fears <PERSON> d'Aubuisson </PERSON> is `` the power behind the throne.''

<TEXT>
 The minister of justice and labor under deposed President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> was charged Monday under a law he often used to harass political dissidents. Also Monday, a Chilean convicted of participating in the September 1980 assassination of <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON>, who was ousted as president of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> in July 1979, said he will appeal a police order expelling him from <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>. Charges filed by Attorney General <PERSON> Diogenes </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said the former minister, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Eugenio </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacquet </PERSON>, would `` attack opponents of the former regime, calling them subversives and implicating them in terrorist plans.'' <PERSON> Jacquet </PERSON>'s statements and actions were `` an open incitement to violence, to disobedience of laws and a form of preaching hate between Paraguayans,'' the document said. Law 209, titled `` In <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Persons </ORGANIZATION>,'' says anyone convicted of inciting violence or urging people to disobey laws can be given a jail sentence of one month to three years. `` Preaching hate between Paraguayans'' carries a sentence of one to six years. The law also forbids defaming the president or his ministers. It often was used to detain opposition leaders for several days and sometimes for months. Excerpts of <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>'s charges published by the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Ultima </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hora </ORGANIZATION> cited an occasion in 1987 when <PERSON> Jacquet </PERSON> threatened to `` neutralize those who criticized'' the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s leadership Gen. <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> was deposed Feb. 3 by Gen. <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, a longtime associate, after ruling <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> for nearly 35 years. Opposition leaders have asked <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> to repeal the law. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Modesto </PERSON> <PERSON> Esquivel </PERSON>, former director of the postal service, also was charged with violating Law 209. Days before the coup, he threatened to go into the streets with `` assault battalions'' to defend the <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> regime. Both men are under arrest, charged with `` crimes against public administration'' that include fraud, embezzlement and bribery. <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> is in exile in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Alejandro </PERSON> <PERSON> Mella </PERSON> <PERSON> Latorre </PERSON>, the 39-year-old Chilean convicted in <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON>'s death, was placed under house arrest Sunday. After his release from prison Feb. 17, two weeks after <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> was ousted, <PERSON> Mella </PERSON> <PERSON> Latorre </PERSON> said, `` My roots are in <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>'' and that he would try to remain. Police say, however, that Paraguayan law allows the expulsion of immigrants convicted of crimes punishable by more than two years in prison. <PERSON> Mella </PERSON> <PERSON> Latorre </PERSON> claims not to have been involved in the assassination of <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON>, who was killed by bazooka and gunfire on an <LOCATION> Asuncion </LOCATION> street, but he served six years in jail for it and another two years for participating in January 1986 prison riot.

 The payment of monthly `` imminent danger'' bonuses to sailors deployed in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> will come to an end April 1, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. The bonuses, previously known as hostile fire or combat pay, are worth $ 110 a month and have been paid to servicemen working inside the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> since August 25, 1987. Defense sources disclosed almost two months ago that Gen. <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwarzkopf </PERSON>, the head of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, had recommended an end to the bonuses because the truce in the Iran-Iraq war was continuing to hold. Adm. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON>, the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>, approved the recommendation recently and officials in the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s manpower office then signed the order Monday, said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Caldwell </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. According to <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> statistics, about $ 16 million has been paid out in danger bonuses since August 1987. Before the ceasefire took hold in the Iran-Iraq war last August, about 8,000 servicemen were receiving the payments every month. While most of those receiving the bonuses were deployed on ships in the region or flew warplanes over the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>'s waters, servicemen assigned to small bases in <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> were also eligible. As a result, about 1,300 women also received the bonuses at one point or another, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said. According to defense officials who declined to be identified, <PERSON> Schwarzkopf </PERSON> concluded early last January the threat to <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION> assigned to the region `` has receded to the point that it is difficult to justify danger payments.'' `` And the fact that we went to a different regime _ one of monitoring ship traffic instead of actually escorting tankers directly _ changed things, too,'' observed one source, speaking on condition of anonymity. The Central Command is the organization responsible for American military operations in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> region. As such, it is the parent command for the Joint Task Force <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, the unit responsible for guaranteeing the safety of merchant ships flying the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flag in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. The administration of former President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> agreed in the spring of 1987 to extend American military protection to 11 Kuwaiti tankers after they re-registered under the Stars and Stripes. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, a friend of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and a key ally of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, had seen its ships become a special target of Iranian forces. In August 1987, one month after the first Kuwaiti tanker to be escorted ran into an underwater mine, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> announced it would start making the payments to the crews of warships operating inside the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, the Strait of Hormuz and a small portion of the Gulf of <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION>, as well as personnel in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> agreed to a truce last August in their bloody, 8-year-old war and to date, the cease-fire has held. As a result, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has slowly reduced the number of warships operating in the region and stopped conducting closely supervised convoy runs. Instead, the ships now in the region maintain what the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> calls a `` monitoring regime'' of keeping U.S.-flag tankers within radar or radio range. The authority to make imminent danger payments was provided to the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> in 1983 under an amendment to a law that had previously established procedures for providing hostile fire, or combat, pay. The new law specified that danger pay could be provided to servicemen deployed in areas where there was a risk of terrorism or other physical threats, even though <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> forces were not directly involved in combat. After April 1, only a small number of servicemen assigned to four countries _ <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> _ will be receiving the danger bonuses.

 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it is prepared to support the Salvadoran government that emerges from Sunday's national election _ but only so long as it respects democracy and protects human rights Department spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> praised the <LOCATION> Salvadoran </LOCATION> people for having braved `` violence and terror'' by leftist guerrillas who, he said, tried harder to disrupt Sunday's balloting than in any other election in seven years. `` Our position is that we support the democratic process, that we are prepared to support the person who emerges from that democratic process,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. `` Our relationship with that new government will dependon its adherence to democracy and respect for human rights, the twin pillars of our approach to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> spoke hours before the candidate of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mena </PERSON>, conceded defeat to <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>, nominee of the rightist <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> party. At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said judgments about human rights will be a `` very important factor'' in guiding <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy toward <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> also criticized <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla attempts to disrupt the voting. Asked by reporters about the deaths of two Salvadoran and one Dutch journalist Sunday at the hands of security forces, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said he lacked details. `` But what ought to be disturbing to the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people, and I know it's disturbing to the people of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, is the fact that the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> threatened the people of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> with their lives for exercising the democratic right to vote. That is a very disturbing, shocking event and we ouht to be shocked about that,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said after an awards ceremony. Two members of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation sent by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to observe the election _ Sen. <PERSON> Mitch </PERSON> <PERSON> McConnell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ky </LOCATION>., and Rep. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, D-Calif. _ said the process appeared to be fair but the actions of the new government will decide whether <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid `` We concluded that it was a free and fair and honest election,'' <PERSON> McConnell </PERSON> said. `` Clearly the activities of the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> had some impact on turnout in some areas of the country.'' <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> said the delegation met with <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> and told him that `` if they return to the death squads, return to the killing of the early'80s, they should not expect support from individuals in our legislature as well as our government.'' But <PERSON> McConnell </PERSON> cautioned against applying an unreasonable standard. `` We had more murders in this city -LRB- <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> -RRB- last year than they did in the occupied territories of the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. We're not in a very good position to be lecturing people about violence,'' he said. `` The standard we need to apply here is not to expect that no violence will occur in a country in which a war is going on but rather how incidents are handled.'' Meanwhile, dozens of demonstrators were removed by police Monday from a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> entrance as hundreds of others protesting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for the Salvadoran government chanted from across the street. The demonstrators did not resist as they were dragged away from the diplomatic entrance. Barricades were then put up and employees were diverted to other entrances. Placards and chants accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of supporting right-wing `` death squads.'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said the government of outgoing President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> was committed to democracy and to improving human rights performance. `` We will look to the new Salvadoran government to uphold the same standards and to press for improvement,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. The election took place amid growing restiveness in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> about <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> policy in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, partly because of the Arena party's growing strength. A key figure in the Arena hierarchy is Maj. <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Aubuisson </PERSON>, who was once described by a former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, as a `` pathological killer.'' In 1980, the <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administration stripped <PERSON> D'Aubuisson </PERSON> of his <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> visa. As administration and congressional sources see it, continued legislative support for large-scale aid for <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> will depend in some measure on <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>'s ability to demonstrate that he is more than a front man for <PERSON> D'Aubuisson </PERSON>. Although returns are not final, <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> has claimed victory over the candidate of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mena </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has provided about $ 3.5 billion in economic and military assistance to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> during this decade, making it the largest recipient of assistance in the hemisphere. Some in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> maintain that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has received little in return on its investment, pointing out that politically-motivated killings average about 20 a month and that efforts to negotiate an end to the strife have not succeeded. The conflict, now nearly 10 years old, is estimated to have claimed about 70,000 lives.

<TEXT>
 Government and opposition negotiators attacked a series of unresolved problems Monday as talks on political and economic reform entered a crucial phase. Solidarity, the banned independent union movement, reported progress on amending a draft law on upcoming <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> elections that the government last week sent to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> for discussion without consulting the opposition. Solidarity national spokesman <PERSON> Janusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Onyszkiewicz </PERSON> said the government agreed to an opposition proposal that each candidate have a representative on vote-counting commissions. That clause had been dropped from the government draft sent to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. Government negotiators also accepted an opposition demand that the draft clearly state the law would be valid only for the upcoming elections in June, <PERSON> Onyszkiewicz </PERSON> said. He said other problems remain, including a debate over the number of signatures needed to nominate a candidate, but `` it is a fact that the government side is ready to assume a flexible stand on all those problems.'' Negotiators hope to wrap up talks at the working groups so that a plenary session can be held April 3. The talks began Feb. 6. Negotiators at a working group on trade union issues have reached agreement on most issues, said opposition negotiator <PERSON> Henryk </PERSON> <PERSON> Wujec </PERSON>. But he said the two sides had failed to agree on the future of workers who were fired for their participation in Solidarity or their refusal to leave it when it was banned after the December 1981 martial law crackdown. Solidarity wants a statement saying the fired workers have the right to return to their jobs included in the round-table document on trade unions. The government says it is prepared to issue an appeal to managers to allow the workers to return, <PERSON> Wujec </PERSON> said. Tens of thousands of workers were dismissed from their jobs after martial law, <PERSON> Wujec </PERSON> said. `` We -LRB- Solidarity -RRB- decided if this problem is not solved, we would n't be able to sign the final document. I think some solution must be found,'' he said. Although disputes remain, one senior Solidarity supporter expressed optimism that the talks would end in agreement. `` I am not that much of a pessimist to think that the round table will end with a crash,'' <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Turowicz </PERSON>, editor of the respected <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> weekly <ORGANIZATION> Tygodnik </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Powszechny </ORGANIZATION> told reporters. In another development, the banned union Rural Solidarity concluded a two-day national congress by expressing reservations about the upcoming <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> elections and asking that its property confiscated under martial law be returned, a spokesman said Monday. The meeting Saturday and Sunday in a <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> church brought together more than 400 private farmers from around the country in the first congress of Rural Solidarity since it was declared illegal following the imposition of martial law. Negotiators at the round-table talks have agreed in principle to grant legality again to Rural Solidarity. Solidarity and Rural Solidarity are separate groups but are allied on most issues. Rural Solidarity spokesman <PERSON> Jacek </PERSON> <PERSON> Szymaderski </PERSON> said the union does not plan to boycott parliamentary elections now being negotiated between the opposition and the government `` despite the fact that the proposed electoral law is not democratic and the proposed date is premature.'' <PERSON> Szymanderski </PERSON> said Rural Solidarity can expect to gain the support of about a million private farmers when it is legalized.

 <LOCATION> Daytona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> once again is <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s big spring break attraction, leaving some merchants in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> _ the original draw for college students _ hungry for business. <LOCATION> Daytona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> officials have opened their arms to spring breakers and expect more than 400,000 to show up at the beach and patronize the city's hotels, bars and other resort businesses in the next two weeks, pumping an estimated $ 100 million into the city's economy. And companies as diverse as <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T are working to capitalize on the city that bills itself `` The World's Most Famous Beach'' with major promotions to attract any loose dollars <LOCATION> Volusia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> lifeguards patrolling the shores in the <LOCATION> Daytona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> area reported record crowds last weekend, and Chief Beach Ranger <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirvan </PERSON> estimated there were 150,000 beachgoers on Saturday alone. `` We're busting at the seams,'' he said. But 229 miles to the south, the city popularized as the original mecca for spring break revelers in the movie `` Where the Boys Are'' expects fewer than 20,000 students this year, down from 350,000 as recently as 1985. <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> merchants believe they have lost $ 100 million in annual business with the disappearance of the spring break crowd. `` There's vacation, and then there's party,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Aulb </PERSON>, 19, a student from <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, who baked under the <LOCATION> Daytona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> sun. Aulb, a student coordinator for spring break tours in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, said he organized 20 busloads of spring travelers, with only one headed to <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>. `` <LOCATION> Daytona </LOCATION> usually opens their arms to everyone,'' <LOCATION> Daytona </LOCATION> police Officer N.F. <PERSON> Fiore </PERSON> said. `` It's a free-wheeling town.'' <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> responded to large crowds several years ago with a police crackdown on public drinking and driving infractions. <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> has made it clear since 1985 that he does n't want hordes of drunken college students in his city, preferring to boost the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> destination as a family resort. `` I foresee nothing but a good impression,'' <ORGANIZATION> Cox </ORGANIZATION> said. `` There's a couple of bar owners over there that do n't agree But by and large, people say they've seen a real change in attitude.'' T-shirt airbrush artist <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>, who has been coming to <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> for spring break for the past nine years, said he is selling his apartment and packing it up after this season. By Friday, he had designed only one $ 12 shirt. `` Your lovely mayor has really screwed things up,'' he said. `` He killed a billion-dollar business and did n't replace it with anything. It's a shame that <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> has become a seniors-only condo.'' But in spite of missing college students, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Greater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lauderdale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Visitors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>, said 1988 was a record year for tourism. `` We're finding replacement markets that are beginning to coalesce and replace the spring break,'' he said. <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> pulled in $ 2.3 billion last year from 3.5 million visitors, a 4.5 percent gain over 1987, and he expects to break records again in the first quarter of 1989. <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Gill </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Broward </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Motel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said there was a 17 percent occupancy increase in the city's 30,000 rooms in January 1989, compared with January 1988.

 Two senior police officers were killed Monday while returning from a meeting with colleagues in the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, authorities said. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> claimed responsibility. Lawmakers from <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> said the slayings suggested a serious breach of security involving the regular consultations between the two police forces, set up under the Anglo-Irish Accord to coordinate action against terrorism. Irish Prime Minister <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Haughey </PERSON> condemned the murders and pledged full cooperation in the investigation. The South Armagh Brigade of the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> sent a message to news media claiming responsibility and saying the movements of the victims had been monitored. The deaths followed a series of retaliatory slayings by <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> and Roman Catholic extremists. On Sunday, gunmen stormed a <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> home and killed a <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> man while he said his prayers with his wife. A police spokesman said the names of the two dead officers were not released, and said he had no firm information on how they were killed. `` We assume they were shot,'' he said on condition of anonymity. Press Association, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s domestic news agency, identified the victims as Chief Superintendent <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Breen </PERSON> and Superintendent <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Breen </PERSON>, the police commander in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Armagh </LOCATION> area, was said to be the highest-ranking police officer killed in 20 years of sectarian violence in the province. `` They were in an unmarked car, without uniforms, so their identity had to be through information supplied to the terrorists,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> McCrea </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unionist </ORGANIZATION> member of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. The constabulary said the car was found near <LOCATION> Jonesborough </LOCATION>, just inside the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> province of <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. The area was sealed off and the area was searched by helicopter before police and troops moved in. Northern Ireland Secretary <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> pledged that the security forces would take `` every possible step'' to combat the wave of retaliatory murders. King, the British <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> minister responsible for <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, discussed the violence Monday with deputy police chief <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> McAtamney </PERSON> of the Royal Ulster Constabulary. `` What the <ORGANIZATION> RUC </ORGANIZATION> and all the security forces need at this time is the full support of the whole community in a total rejection of violence and a maximum public alertness and vigilance against these evil groups,'' he said afterwards. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Braniff </PERSON>, 63 and a father of 13, was shot dead in his north <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> home Sunday night. Neighbors said two gunmen burst into <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION>'s house and shot him at point-blank range. They said he died with his rosary in his hands. Police appealed to the public to help find <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION>'s killers. No group immediately claimed responsibility. <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>, was a bricklayer who had been a <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> before he married. He had British flags tattooed on his arms and worked in Protestant areas of <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>. On Friday, <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> civil servant <PERSON> Niall </PERSON> <PERSON> Davies </PERSON>, 42, was shot in his home, apparently in retaliation for the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> killing the previous night of <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Irvine </PERSON>, 49, a former commander of the <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> paramilitary <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Volunteer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>. The latest round of killings began Feb. 12 when <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Finucane </PERSON> was shot in his home. The Protestant underground <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fighters </ORGANIZATION> said they killed him because he was an <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> officer. His widow denied it. The mainly <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> is fighting to end British rule in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and unite the province with the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> to the south, while the <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> majority wants to remain under the British flag.

<HEAD>Group Sees Growing Threat from Hazardous Materials on Rails</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Toxic railroad accidents pose a growing threat to communities nationwide and federal regulators do too little to prevent them, a private group contended Monday. More than 24,000 people were evacuated as a result of 351 rail accidents involving toxic materials in 1987, according to <ORGANIZATION> Citizen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION>, a public interest group based in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> with chapters in 25 states. Forty-one of 50 states had at least one accident, the group said, basing its findings on figures supplied by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. A spokeswoman for the federal agency defended enforcement efforts, saying that more hazardous material is being transported by rail and yet figures on rail cars leaking such material show a decline from 1984 and 1985. In 1987, the private group said, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> led the nation with 49 rail accidents involving hazardous materials, followed by <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> with 46 and <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> with 15 each. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> had the greatest number of railcars leaking toxic materials, _ 29, or nearly one-third of the total _ in what the group considered the most accurate measure of accident severity. <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> led the country with 12,360 people evacuated. Although the number of toxic rail accidents nationwide declined 3.7 percent from 1986, <ORGANIZATION> Citizen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> said the severity of those accidents `` increased significantly,'' with the number of railroad cars leaking toxic substances up 12.7 percent, from 79 in 1986 to 89 in 1987. Those numbers, however, are down from 109 railcars that released hazardous materials in 1985 and 100 in 1984, said the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. Most toxic rail accidents were concentrated in heavily populated states bordering the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> _ states with heavy industry or oil and gas production, Citizen Action said. `` Few communities are safe from the environmental contamination of these catastrophes on wheels,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Creamer </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Citizen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> and executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, which conducted the study. Citizen Action said 4 billion tons of hazardous materials are shipped annually, involving 250,000 shipments and 3,000 carloads a day. The group contended that although 53 percent of rail accidents involving hazardous materials stemmed from mechanical failures, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> does not effectively enforce rail safety standards. `` The greatest contributor to toxic rail accidents are unsafe track and roadbeds, yet even when FRA inspectors find a defect, they do not assess a penalty _ they only notify the railroad of its non-compliance,'' <PERSON> Creamer </PERSON> said. A spokeswoman for the agency said notifications come only in very minor cases, and she said the agency in 1987 assessed hazardous materials penalities totaling $ 646,750.

<HEAD>No Evidence Found of Wiring Fault in Crashed Airliner</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Investigators found no evidence of fire or incorrect wiring in the right-hand engine of a British <ORGANIZATION> Midland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> jetliner that crashed on Jan. 8, killing 47 people, an interim report said Monday. The bulletin issued by the government's Air Accident Investigation Branch reached no conclusion about the cause of the crash and said much work remains to be done on the investigation. The right-hand engine was shut off and the left-hand engine on fire when the plane crashed early in the flight from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, the report said. It confirmed passengers' reports of a fire in the left-hand engine of the brand-new <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 and said one fan blade had fractured. In his first public comment since the accident, pilot <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> said, `` Both the first officer -LRB- <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> McLelland </PERSON> -RRB- and I agreed that the right engine was causing us the problem.'' Hunt, still hospitalized, said in a statement the crew had no indication of a fire in the left engine until less than a minute from crashing while trying to land at central <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Midlands </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. The report quoted the flight crew as saying cockpit instruments confirmed their belief that they had resolved their onboard emergency by shutting off the right engine, and that the left engine was operating normally. The left engine lost power when the airplane was nearly 2 -LCB- miles from the airport and 900 feet above ground, and <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> told <PERSON> McLelland </PERSON> to restart the right engine, the report said. Seventeen seconds later, a bell rang warning of a fire in the left engine, and 36 seconds after that the plane crashed without ever regaining power in the right engine. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON>, chairman of British <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION>, said the airline was satisfied the report `` accurately relates the sequence of events so far as they're known.'' He said he did not expect a final report to be available until early next year.

 Democratic mayoral candidate <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> picked up an endorsement Monday from <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, who spurned the candidate of his close ally, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` He is the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s nominee and I am the national <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> stands for the future of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, for reaching out to all Democrats, for building better schools, safer streets, and a stronger economy. `` These values are at the heart of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said, `` and I heartily endorse them and him.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who supported Mayor <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> in his losing primary election bid against <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, has since shifted support to a third-party candidate, <PERSON> Alderman </PERSON> <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>. The victor of the April 4 election will serve the final two years of the four-year term won by the late Mayor <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> in April 1987. He died in November 1987. <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, the son of former Mayor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, is white; <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, like <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, is black. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was pivotal in helping <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> secure the Democratic chairmanship, but <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> also worked hard to prove to moderates and conservatives that he would be independent of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and other party liberals. `` The reverend knows I'm here. I'm not here to pick a fight with Rev. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> or any other Democrats,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> told reporters after joining <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> for a breakfast with more than 100 black business and political leaders. `` The Rev. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and I are friends. I respect him. I told him what I planned to do and he did n't try to persuade me otherwise,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, the nominee of the <ORGANIZATION> Harold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, attempted to take some of the glow off the morning meeting, calling it `` the quickest trip a national party chairman has ever taken. He waved hello and waved goodbye in a matter of a few hours. `` It does n't sound like a ringing endorsement of <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> to me. I do n't put down <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>,'' he added. `` I know he's between a rock and a hard place.'' The most recent poll in the campaign, done by <ORGANIZATION> WLS-TV </ORGANIZATION>, showed 53 percent of the respondents favoring <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> to 36 percent for <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, 5 percent for <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON> and 6 percent undecided.

<HEAD>Report Urges Accelerator Development as Reactor Alternative</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LES BLUMENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Use of a linear accelerator to produce tritium for nuclear weapons appears to be a promising alternative to current <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> plans to build new production reactors, according to a scientific report released Monday. The report, prepared by scientists at the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alamos </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Brookhaven </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, national laboratories, urged consideration of an accelerator as a possible backup to building new reactors at the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> complex in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Idaho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>. The report said construction of new reactors was the `` lowest technical risk approach to supplying the critical need for tritium.'' `` However, we believe it is prudent that DOE pursue other technologies for tritium production to provide potential alternatives as a contingency for the future,'' the report said. `` One concept that appears to be particularly promising is the accelerator production of tritium.'' <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON>, acting head of the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Production </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reactors </ORGANIZATION>, told a special panel of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Monday that the department has yet to see the report. `` We will review the report with great interest,'' <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON> said, adding that department believes the accelerator proposal involves a `` level of risk too great at this time'' to make it an alternative to constructing the reactors. The nation's current supply of tritium is threatened by the crumbling conditions at the department's existing production reactors and weapons plants. An accelerator is essentially a long tunnel in which subatomic particles are whipped at high speed until they crash into a target, in this case lithium clad in aluminum. The resulting collision produces tritium _ a critical element in nuclear weapons that increases the power of warheads, but decays rapidly. The report said that an accelerator could be completed within eight to nine years on an aggressive schedule compared with at least 10 years to finish a new production reactor. An accelerator would cost about $ 2.3 billion, including $ 600 million for contingencies, the report said. The estimated cost of the new <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> reactor has been pegged at about $ 3.2 billion, while the <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> reactor would cost about $ 3.6 billion.

 The next <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> move in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> will be a plea to the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday to ease tensions on the Israeli-held <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said Monday. But prospects for success apparently are dim. <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials already have vowed not to relent in their 15-month uprising while <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> told 1,100 visiting foreign Jews in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> that he would not deal with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>.

A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said, meanwhile, that President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> would be here April 3 to 5 for similar meetings. King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> is expected later in the spring. Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> appropriations subcommittee last week he might urge <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to talk to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> if negotiations could not be held with other Palestinians. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> also unveiled during a visit by Israeli Foreign Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> his hopes for reciprocal gestures by the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. The idea would be for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to relax its grip on the territories by reversing its detention of Palestinians while the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> would try to moderate the protests that began in December 1987. Since then, 403 Arabs and 17 Israelis have been killed. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, announced on Monday the sixth <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> session with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> would be held in <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>. He said its purpose was `` instituting a dialogue'' with <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s organization. Without going into detail, <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said the idea was `` to try to make some concrete progress in the peace process.'' Other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, who declined to be identified, said Ambassador <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelletreau </PERSON>'s meeting with a <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> representative on Wednesday would provide an opportunity to seek reciprocal easing of tensions. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> enovy has held five sessions in <LOCATION> Carthage </LOCATION> since the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration ended a 13-year ban on dealing with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> last December. <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials have complained the meetings were not substantive. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, on the other hand, criticized the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for accepting a pledge by <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> renouncing terrorism. Since then, PL0 guerrillas have conducted several raids against Israelis in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> has concluded the attacks do not amount to terrorism requiring the talks to be broken off. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, in a speech in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, said `` we fully recognize that the status quo is not in our interest, because it means absence of peace, and peace is our paramount goal.'' At the same time, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> reiterated <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s reasons for refusing to talk to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> or to withdraw from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, which were lost by <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in the 1967 Six-Day War. `` The government is united in its opposition to the creation of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> state west of the <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. We are opposed to negotiations with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> because it will inevitably lead to a demand for a state west of the <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>,'' he said.

 Members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> asked the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on Monday to explain why testing of Western-made high-definition television equipment in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> would n't violate laws prohibiting the transfer of advanced technology to the Soviet bloc Reps. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, D-Mass., and <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON>, R-Pa., said in a letter to <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> Undersecretary <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Freedenberg </PERSON> they were concerned `` about affording the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> access to advanced television cameras, displays, video recorders and signal processing technology'' that could `` result in the transfer to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> of sensitive technology that has potential for both military and commercial applications The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has offered to conduct the first side-by-side tests of competing HDTV technologies being developed in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The Soviets say the tests would be an objective assessment of the differing systems and could speed development of a single system for worldwide use. At hearings earlier this month before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on telecommunications and finance, which is chaired by <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, questions were raised about possible violations of export-control accords. HDTV, which promises motion-picture quality images, has a number of potential uses, including entertainment, medicine, education and the military. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has jurisdiction over <ORGANIZATION> COCOM </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Coordinating </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Multilateral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Export </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>, which is an international watchdog agency regulating the flow of high-technology products from Western nations to the communist bloc. <PERSON> Markey </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Freedenberg </PERSON> to report back within 30 days on whether advanced television technologies are subject to the COCOM restrictions and if they had been approved for transfer to the Soviet bloc. Their letter asked <PERSON> Freedenberg </PERSON> to spell out `` what actions the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and other federal departments, agencies or entities presently are taking or, prospectively, will take to ensure that HDTV or advanced television technologies, if they are prohibited technologies, are not transferred to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> or other Eastern bloc nations by domestic or foreign entities.'' They also asked <PERSON> Freedenberg </PERSON> to outline how Commerce determines what is prohibited by <ORGANIZATION> COCOM </ORGANIZATION> and how the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> monitors adherence to the accords by other nations. <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, a policy adviser in the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, said agency officials could not comment on the letter until they had seen it But he noted that <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON>, during a recent appearance before the subcommittee, `` said he was not in favor of exporting potentially strategic sensitive technology to the Eastern bloc.'' <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> also told the subcommittee his department had not agreed to any such transfers, <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> has yet to implement many steps recommended by a security consultant who in 1986 warned that the airline was doing little to prevent bombs from being smuggled onto aircraft, a congresswoman said Monday. According to Rep. <PERSON> Cardiss </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, D-Ill., the Israeli security firm <ORGANIZATION> KPI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> cautioned the carrier more than two years ago that it was `` highly vulnerable'' to terrorist attacks `` The fact that no major disaster has occurred to date is merely providential,'' <ORGANIZATION> KPI </ORGANIZATION> wrote in September 1986, Mrs. <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> said. Last Dec. 21, <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>'s Flight 103 was blown from the skies over <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> by a bomb authorities say was placed in a radio-cassette player, killing 270 people. Mrs. <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, chairwoman of the <ORGANIZATION> Goverment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> transportation subcommittee, wrote a letter to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> on Monday quoting portions of reports the security company wrote to <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> in September and November of 1986. Mrs. <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> wrote that `` within days'' of the completion of the September 1986 paper, a terrorist attack in <LOCATION> Karachi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, killed 18 <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> passengers and crew members. The studies included examinations of security at nine airports, including <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. Flight 103 originated in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> and had landed in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>' letter said that according to information her panel has gathered `` from a variety of sources,'' <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> has yet to correct `` many of the gaps'' specified in the 1986 studies. `` If they had been, it is possible that those lives could have been saved,'' she wrote, referring to the <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> disasters. <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Kriendler </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>'s corporate communications vice president at the airline's <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> headquarters, said <ORGANIZATION> KPI </ORGANIZATION> is unfamiliar with <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>'s current security program. He said the company would not respond to <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>' criticism until corporate officials had seen the letter. The <ORGANIZATION> KPI </ORGANIZATION> reports concluded that <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> conducted insufficient checks of baggage, did a poor job of questioning passengers boarding planes, and was slow to react to warnings of possible terrorist activity, according to Mrs. <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>. `` In conclusion, there are no adequate safeguards under the presently operating security system that would prevent a passenger from boarding a plane with explosives on his person or in his baggage, whether or not he is aware of the fact,'' the security company wrote. The reports said X-ray examinations of luggage should be replaced with manual searches, which were performed too infrequently. `` On the whole, the presently employed search techniques stand a low chance of discovering concealed explosive charges, if at all,'' the consultant wrote. The company wrote that careful scrutiny of lost-and-found baggage `` is very rare,'' making it simple for explosives `` to be sent ownerless to a supposed destination.'' At some airports, including <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, baggage with a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> tag simply placed on a conveyer belt would be loaded onto planes, even without a registered passenger, <ORGANIZATION> KPI </ORGANIZATION> said. The consultant criticized airline employees for being too lax when searching the baggage of Americans and of citizens of each airport's country, considering them safer. `` It might be pointed out that the question of citizenship is irrelevant to the terrorist threat,'' <ORGANIZATION> KPI </ORGANIZATION> said. The consultant said it found little effort to carefully scrutinize suspicious-looking passengers. It also complained that in some instances, warnings of terrorist plans were not relayed to all <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> security workers. In one incident, all <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> security employees at <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> were not told of a warning received about two <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> women who were planning to place explosives aboard a plane. The report did not say what the consequences were.

 <PERSON> Michelangelo </PERSON> would have run afoul of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> law if he tried to sell his painting of the <ORGANIZATION> Sistine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chapel </ORGANIZATION> as an original, an attorney challenging the state's new `` schlock art'' law claimed Monday. `` The statute as it is written defines ` original' as requiring only one person to work on it, and <PERSON> Michelangelo </PERSON> had apprentices that helped him out,'' said attorney <PERSON> Alvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Nathanson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Nathanson </PERSON> represents <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paintings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which sells oil paintings for $ 35 to $ 200 in seaside art galleries and shopping malls up and down the Eastern seaboard. The company sued <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> saying the state law _ the first of its sort in the nation _ is vague and unconstitutional. The law bans the sale of `` non-original art'' unless it is labeled `` not an original.'' It defines original as `` independently created and executed and signed by the individual artist'' _ a standard <PERSON> Nathanson </PERSON> insists many Old Masters could not meet. After a three-day trial last week, both sides are now waiting for <ORGANIZATION> Suffolk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cratsley </PERSON> to decide what separates original art from schlock. <PERSON> Cratsley </PERSON> is not expected to rule until next month at the earliest. The state legislator who wrote the law said he only intended to keep consumers from being sold cheap copies under the guise of `` original'' art. State Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Buell </PERSON> said `` schlock art'' companies put names similar to those of famous artists on paintings that are very similar to the well-known works. While such paintings stop short of forgery, <PERSON> Buell </PERSON> said, they are certainly not original. `` There's nothing wrong with selling it,'' said <PERSON> Buell </PERSON>, who sponsored the law on behalf of artists in the seaside resort of <LOCATION> Rockport </LOCATION>. `` It's just deceitful to tell the customer who's paying $ 45 or $ 65 that he's getting an original painting.'' <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION>, in a broad attack on the law, has asked the court not only to define original but also to explain how police officers charged with enforcing the law could be expected to make such distinctions. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkins </PERSON>, the assistant attorney general defending the state, has argued that the point is moot since <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> has never been prosecuted, though it has sold more than 60,000 paintings since the law was passed. <PERSON> Wilkins </PERSON> also has argued that the law is constitutional because it protects consumers against deceptive marketing. He told the judge it could be used to prosecute those who copy others' work, make machine reproductions and sell them as original oil paintings or sign false names to paintings. <PERSON> Wilkins </PERSON> dismissed the <PERSON> Michelangelo </PERSON> example, saying any law could be challenged in the abstract using far-fetched examples. `` How are they going to sell the <ORGANIZATION> Sistine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chapel </ORGANIZATION>, anyway?'' he said. `` Is it like selling the <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION>?''

 Israeli troops shot and wounded 10 Palestinians in the occupied territories on Monday, and four Jewish settlers were arrested on suspicion of burning Arab farm equipment in a vigilante raid. The <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> was paralyzed for the third day in a general strike called after bloody riots. Over the weekend, seven Palestinians were killed in clashes by army gunfire, raising to 403 the number of Palestinians killed since the uprising began Dec. 8, 1987, protesting Israeli occupation of lands seized from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. Seventeen Israelis have also died. Despite curfews that confined more than 330,000 <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> residents to their homes, six Palestinians were wounded in clashes in the seaside strip. The wounded included a 9-year-old boy from <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yunis </PERSON> who was shot in the stomach, Arab hospital officials said. The army confirmed four wounded in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. The army said two soldiers were slightly hurt in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> when they were attacked by Arab stone-throwers, and one lost his rifle. The army ordered residents to return the weapon by Tuesday morning or face harsh sanctions, <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> reported. <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said residents were threatened with curfews and water cuts. Four Jewish settlers in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> were arrested Monday and accused of setting fire to 16 Palestinian-owned greenhouses and a tractor near <LOCATION> Deir </LOCATION> <LOCATION> el-Balah </LOCATION> refugee camp Saturday night. The raid was reportedly in retaliation for a Friday attack on a settler-owned packing house in Gush Katif. The national <ORGANIZATION> Itim </ORGANIZATION> news agency said an army patrol spotted the vigilantes and informed police of the raid. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, four Palestinians were wounded Monday, the army said. Arab hospital officials said they included a 70-year-old man from <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, shot in the leg. The head of the military administration in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Shaike </PERSON> <PERSON> Erez </PERSON>, meanwhile held a meeting with <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> leaders in the area. `` It was not the first meeting and it wo n't be the last,'' said the administration spokesman, Capt. <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafowicz </PERSON>. Arab participants said they told <ORGANIZATION> Erez </ORGANIZATION> that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> must negotiate with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> to end the uprising. `` People said this was a political struggle ... that needed a negotiated and peaceful solution,'' said <PERSON> Gabi </PERSON> <PERSON> Baramki </PERSON>, acting president of <ORGANIZATION> Bir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zeit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` We said the only negotiating partner is the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>.'' Israeli leaders insist they will not negotiate with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, which they regard as a terrorist organization. The radical Islamic fundamentalist <ORGANIZATION> Hamas </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- Zeal -RRB- movement released a leaflet on Monday calling for a general strike in two weeks and an Arab boycott of Israeli products.

<HEAD>Police Say Bloody Underworld War Has Ended</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The boss of a gang battling <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s top underworld syndicate told police his gang will disband, ending the bloodiest gangster vendetta in postwar Japanese history, police said Monday. <PERSON> Hiroshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Yamamoto </PERSON>, 64, visited a police station near his home Sunday afternoon to announce his decision to disband the Ichiwa-kai gang, said police in <LOCATION> Kobe </LOCATION>, a major port city in western <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. `` He came here, told us the gang was disbanding, and left. It all took about three minutes,'' the officer at Higashi-Nada precinct said. It is not uncommon for gangsters to make such appearances at police stations, and many bosses even make written vows to police to end conflicts or disband gangs, said the officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity. But he said police are still waiting for a reaction from the rival Yamaguchi-gumi, by far the nation's largest crime syndicate, and further skirmishes could erupt. The Ichiwa-kai, which had an estimated 6,000 members at its peak, was created in June 1984 after an internal dispute over <ORGANIZATION> Yamaguchi-gumi </ORGANIZATION>'s leadership led to a revolt by followers of boss-candidate <PERSON> Yamamoto </PERSON>. In January 1985, two Ichiwa-kai gangsters fatally shot Yamaguchi-gumi boss <PERSON> Masahisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Takenaka </PERSON> and two other syndicate leaders. The <ORGANIZATION> Osaka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Monday upheld a lower court verdict sentencing the two to life imprisonment and also upheld sentences of 10 years for three Ichiwa-kai lookouts. The Ichiwa-kai attack left the Yamaguchi-gumi without a leader, although acting boss <PERSON> Kazuo </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakanishi </PERSON> and `` young leader'' <PERSON> Yoshinori </PERSON> <PERSON> Watanabe </PERSON> quickly led the gang into the bloody vendetta, known to the Japanese as the `` Yama-Ichi War.'' Police say 315 armed incidents during the four-year battle between the two gangs left 25 people dead and more than 70 injured. A Yamaguchi-gumi source said <PERSON> Yamamoto </PERSON> `` timed the breakup of the gang to match the sentencing, as a kind of gesture to the Yamaguchi-gumi.'' He spoke on condition of anonymity. In <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, where gun laws are strict and violent crime rates low, the high-profile gunfights created public outrage and spawned grassroots movements to rid residential areas of gang headquarters and offices. The strongest of those movements evicted a <LOCATION> Yamaguchi-gumi </LOCATION> affiliate from a residential area in <LOCATION> Hamamatsu </LOCATION>, central <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, and the gang today is on the verge of disbanding. Headquarters of both the Yamaguchi-gumi and the Ichiwa-kai are in expensive residential districts in <LOCATION> Kobe </LOCATION>, but their presence has not faced serious local opposition. When the Ichiwa-kai split from the Yamaguchi-gumi, the organization had roughly 10,000 members. Police say it now has more than 20,000. Police say about 86,000 gangsters operate in 3,200 gangs in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Nearly 40 percent belong to the big three nationwide syndicates: the Yamaguchi-gumi, Sumiyoshi Rengo-kai and <LOCATION> Inagawa-kai </LOCATION>. The latter two are based in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>.

 Egyptians and Israelis, discussing their countries' relations after a decade of peace, agreed Monday that solving the Palestinian problem is the only way to foster true friendship between the former enemies. An Israeli Cabinet minister and two Egyptians, all major players in development of the peace treaty signed March 26, 1979, urged the Jewish state to recognize the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> as a first step toward peace across the region. They and a group of students, journalists and others met for a discussion organized by the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and taped for broadcast Tuesday, five days before the anniversary of the first and only treaty between an Arab state and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` Let us make a difference between the two aspects of the -LRB- treaty -RRB-. The first was peace between <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The second was the solution of the Palestinian problem,'' said <PERSON> Butros </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghali </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s minister of state for foreign affairs. `` We have been successful in achieving the first. We have completely failed in achieving the second one.'' <PERSON> Ghali </PERSON> was deeply involved in negotiations over the 1978 U.S.-brokered Camp David Accords, which set a framework for the treaty, and over the treaty itself. `` We decided in Camp David on a very important issue, that we are going to solve the Palestinian problem,'' said <PERSON> Ezer </PERSON> <PERSON> Weizman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s minister of science and development and another key player in the process. `` This is the next issue coming up, and I believe that to continue what we started, we have to do that.'' <PERSON> Ghali </PERSON> agreed, and added: `` Sooner or later, you will talk to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> considers the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> a terrorist group, and a succession of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> governments has vowed never to negotiate with it. <PERSON> Weizman </PERSON>, a leading member of the left-leaning Labor party, reiterated his well-known position that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> should negotiate with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and predicted that talks could begin within two years. Monday's third main participant, <PERSON> Mustafa </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON>, was a senior aide to the late President <PERSON> Anwar </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON>, whose 1977 trip to <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> led to peace between the two countries. Despite diplomatic relations, <LOCATION> Egyptian-Israeli </LOCATION> cooperation in most fields has been very limited. Large numbers of Israeli tourists come to <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, but few Egyptians go to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Several Egyptian participants at Monday's session indicated the extent to which bad blood remains from four <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> wars since 1948. <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON> <PERSON> Daoud </PERSON>, a student at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>, said he had come to the session to discuss <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s relations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, but `` I did not know there would be Israelis here before I came.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s withholding of documents about the toxic-waste cleanup Superfund `` arguably had the purpose or the effect'' of obstructing a 1983 congressional inquiry, an independent counsel said Monday. But <PERSON> Alexia </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> also concluded there was a lack of evidence that the subject of her criminal investigation, former Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON>, was part of any conspiracy to withhold documents in the matter. <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> made `` misleading and disingenuous'' statements during a March 10, 1983, appearance before a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee, but there is insufficient evidence that he `` knowingly testified falsely,'' <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> concluded in a 225-page report. <PERSON> Olson </PERSON>'s answers were not `` overly helpful,'' but `` it clearly can not be said in our view that the testimony actually obstructed the committee's inquiry.'' <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> had announced last Aug. 26 that she would not seek an indictment aganst <PERSON> Olson </PERSON>. Her report, detailing the reasons, was released by a special court that appointed Ms. <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> independent counsel to investigate allegations that Olso gave false testimony to obstruct the inquiry of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Judiciary monopolies subcommittee. The panel was investigating allegations that the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> concocted an `` executive privilege'' claim to prevent <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> from obtaining <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> documents concerning possible misconduct by Superfund officials. The confrontation between <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the executive branch helped bring the ouster of <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> administrator <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Burford </PERSON> and other top officials, including Superfund director <PERSON> Rita </PERSON> <PERSON> Lavelle </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lavelle </PERSON> was later convicted of lying to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> about conflicts of interest in her management of the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s Superfund program. <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>, who unsuccessfully sought to broaden her investigation to consider conspiracy charges against two other former top <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials, suggested in her report that there was a basis for suspecting a concerted effort to thwart the subcommittee's inquiry `` The principal act which arguable had the purpose or the effect of obstructing that inquiry was the failure to disclose to the committee the existence of documents which the department had withheld from its production to the committee,'' <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> said. `` We could find no evidence linking Mr. <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> to that failure.'' <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> noted that then-Deputy Attorney General <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmults </PERSON> withheld handwritten notes of department officials from the documents turned over to the subcommittee. <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>, then assistant attorney general in charge of the lands and natural resources division, also withheld a draft chronology of the executive privilege dispute compiled within the department. The subcomittee was not told that these documents were being withheld and was led to believe that virtually everything covered by its request was turned over, <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> said. `` The concealment of the notes and chronology arguably obstructed, and certainly substantially delayed, the successful completion of the committee's inquiry,'' <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> said. `` And there were enough people involved in this course of conduct to give rise to the question whether they acted in concert to obstruct the committee's inquiry.'' For this reason, <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> said that in late 1986, she asked then-Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> to expand her jurisdiction to pursue conspiracy allegations against <PERSON> Schmults </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>. On the advice of the Criminal Division, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> refused to expand <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>'s mandate and opposed her request to the special court for permission to broaden the investigation. The special division of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> here ruled that it could n't overrule <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> but said <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> could investigate whether <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> participated in a conspiracy. In her report, <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> said, `` The withheld materials were plainly within the compass of ... -LRB- the panel's -RRB- request, and they contained information critical to any assessment of the department's role in the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> documents controversy. Even though there may have been a valid basis for withholding the material, `` there could not be in our view any justification for the failure to inform the committee of the existence of the withheld documents,'' <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> said. In a statement attached to the report, <PERSON> Schmults </PERSON>, now general counsel of <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, in <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, pointed to a 1986 <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> memo concluding that `` there are no reasonable grounds to believe that further investigation or prosecution is warranted'' with regard to him. <PERSON> Olson </PERSON>'s attorneys, in another statement, said he was `` unaware of any evidence suggesting the existence of a <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> conspiracy to obstruct the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> review process; indeed, he views the very concept of a possible conspiracy as preposterous.'' `` The totality of this evidence demonstrates conclusively that Mr. <PERSON> Olson </PERSON>'s conduct throughout the <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> process was wholly inconsistent with the notion that he participated in a scheme to obstruct <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> by secretly withholding documentary materials,'' <PERSON> Olson </PERSON>'s attorneys said.

 The army on Monday barred journalists from the border region where Nicaraguan rebel camps are located after two soldiers were killed by mines in the area. The soldiers were patrolling on foot near the town of <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Congolona </LOCATION>, 100 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION>, when they stepped on the mines Thursday, according to armed forces spokesman Col. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Benavides </PERSON>. Military teams worked over the weekend to clear mines from a 20-square-mile area at the border, he said. `` The Sandinista army has intensified the mining of different Honduran border zones with <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> by making rapid incursions into our territory with what appears to be an attitude of provocation,'' <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Benavides </PERSON> said. `` To avoid acts that we would later regret, the decision was made not to permit journalists to enter Yamales.'' The area is along the <LOCATION> Yamales </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, 102 miles east of <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION>; the road to <LOCATION> Yamales </LOCATION> runs to within 200 yards of the border with <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> in some places. Contra rebels, who have operated from camps in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> since 1981, also are known have planted mines when retreating across the border. Nicaraguan officials had no immediate comment. The two countries regularly exchange accusations on border incidents. Also Monday, <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Eugenio </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> <PERSON> Claramount </PERSON> said at least 14 Hondurans are among the 1,894 former Nicaraguan national guardsmen released last week in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. He said they will soon be returning to <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION>. The Nicaraguan army reported 20 incidents of harassment from Honduran troops across the border from <LOCATION> Teotecacinte </LOCATION>, near the <LOCATION> Yamales </LOCATION> area, this year. No casualties were reported. About 11,000 Contra rebels and their families retreated to base camps in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> after the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> cut off military aid about a year ago. They have been receiving food, medical supplies and other non-lethal <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid. For many years access to the camps was strictly restricted by the Honduran government, but foreign journalists have been able to visit the camps frequently in recent months, usually traveling there by road from <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s 88-year-old patriarch, said in a New Year message Monday that Moslems must overcome carnal desires, but admitted being unable to do so himself <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> television quoted him as saying: `` I hope the Iranian nation and other Moslems throughout the world will transform themselves so they can work for the sake of God, and not for their own victory or their carnal desires. `` In his lifetime, man is afflicted with carnal desires. He needs self-discipline, and I, as the speaker of these words, have not succeeded in this task.'' The Persian New Year begins March 21. President <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> delivered a message stressing postwar reconstruction and development of oil and related industries. A U.N.-sponsored truce was reached with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> last August after eight years of war. In the past year, he said, `` undoubtedly the most important event was the acceptance of the cease-fire ... by <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> and its support by the people.'' Chief Justice <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ardebili </PERSON> canceled New Year vacations for judges and magistrates because of a government anti-narcotics campaign, <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio reported. It quoted him as saying the vacations had been canceled so judges could continue `` stamping out malicious elements and drug smugglers.'' A crackdown on drugs in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> began when a new law took effect Jan. 21, imposing the death sentence for possession of even small quantities. According to official figures, more than 200 offenders have been convicted in Islamic courts and executed. The radio also said a budget of 9.7 trillion rials -LRB- $ 140 billion -RRB- was passed by the parliament Monday and approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Guardian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, which makes sure legislation conforms with Islamic law and the constitution. It said the council made amendments and deleted some items, but it did not describe the changes. A report by the official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said the budget included $ 2.5 billion in loans from abroad for repairing war damage to the infrastructure.

 The African <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> vowed Monday to step up its military and political resistance to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s racial policies, and it expressed support for the embattled <PERSON> Winnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> After a five-day conference of 88 leaders, the main guerrilla group fighting the South African government also said it saw an end in sight to apartheid. `` The apartheid regime is not only steeped in an irreversible crisis, it is weakening in many ways,'' Secretary-General <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Nzo </PERSON> told a news conference. `` The end, I think, is in sight.'' <PERSON> Nzo </PERSON> also said the group had discussed the issue of Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, `` and <PERSON> Winnie </PERSON> should be given the opportunity to continue to be the symbol of our struggle.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, wife of jailed black leader <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, was sharply condemned last month when her personal bodyguards were implicated in the alleged abduction of four black youths and the death of one of them. The <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> dismissed as `` a bluff'' hints of <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s early release from jail. It said an increasing number of political opponents had been imprisoned since a state of emergency was imposed in 1986. The closed-door conference _ the largest since 1986 _ was called to review the situation in southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and to discuss anti-apartheid strategies, which <PERSON> Nzo </PERSON> said will remain unchanged. `` The recent election of F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> as leader of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> will not result in any significant change in policy. His recent utterances ... about a dialogue have no substance,'' said <PERSON> Nzo </PERSON>, who is based in <LOCATION> Lusaka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>. `` The situation in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> remains unchanged in its main elements,'' he said. `` Accordingly we must escalate both the mass political offensive and our armed actions.'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Nkobi </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> treasurer general, said military forces will soon begin moving out of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> under the terms of the southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> peace accord, but he would not say when or where they would go. `` When they move, the people of the world will know,'' he said. <PERSON> Nzo </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> does not seek to operate from <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> after the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> African-controlled </LOCATION> country becomes independent. The <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, which has fought a guerrilla war in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> since 1966, is widely expected to win elections scheduled for next November. `` I have heard different reports. In the past <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> said it will do nothing to stop the struggle against apartheid,'' <PERSON> Nzo </PERSON> said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> has not asked to have bases in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>.'' He said the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> will open new missions in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION> and elsewhere to press for continued international sanctions against <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>'s white minority government.

 Two <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> officers were sent home because of a mock execution in which blanks were fired with machine guns at Norwegian `` prisoners'' during a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> exercise, an army spokesman said Monday. `` It was meant as a joke, but both the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Norwegian </LOCATION> military leadership considered it to be a very bad joke,'' said Gen. <PERSON> Torkel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hovland </PERSON>, commander of a Norwegian division that participated in the `` Cold Winter'' maneuvers. American, British, Dutch and Norwegian soldiers took part in the Arctic exercises held March 3-15. <PERSON> Hovland </PERSON> confirmed a report in the newspaper Fremover, published at <LOCATION> Harstad </LOCATION> in northern <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, describing what happened March 12 after the Norwegians were captured. `` The Norwegians were ordered executed, lined up and ` shot' one-by-one with machine-gun blanks,'' it said `` When one Norwegian officer among the prisoners refused to leave his car, an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soldier put his gun inside the car's open window and fired blanks.'' It said no one was injured and two American officers, a captain and a lieutenant, were held responsible. Their identities were not revealed. Maj. <PERSON> Yngve </PERSON> <PERSON> Jessen </PERSON>, a spokesman for the maneuvers, told the Norwegian news agency <ORGANIZATION> NTB </ORGANIZATION> the incident violated `` all regulations of the Hague and the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> conventions about treatment of prisoners.

<TEXT>
 It might have been a warning or a prank, but the `` gift'' someone left for reputed mobster <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gotti </PERSON> in front of his Little <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> hangout on Monday was not a workable bomb, police said. When bomb squad officers opened a plastic box they found on the step of the <ORGANIZATION> Ravenite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, they at first described what they found inside as an explosive powder. But further analysis disclosed the powder to be two pounds of salt and an ounce of gunpowder. Given such a small amount of powder, plus faulty batteries and wiring, `` it appears the device would not have detonated,'' Chief of Detectives <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Colangelo </PERSON> told reporters. If it had, he added, it probably could n't have done much damage. Asked to explain the incident, he said: `` We could assume it's either a message to <PERSON> Gotti </PERSON> that perhaps he is vulnerable or that his club is vulnerable It could have been a prank. It could have been a lot of things.'' A man telephoned the police department's organized crime bureau shortly after 5 a.m. and said, `` There is a gift for <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gotti </PERSON> at the social club.'' He did not give his name, but identified the club as the Ravenite in lower <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. Police Inspector <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayronne </PERSON> said the device included a 10-inch aluminum bottle packed with powder. The bottle was partially contained in a 4-by-6 inch plastic box which contained batteries wired to a circuit board with an electric timer. The bottle, which contained the powder and a coil, protruded from inside the box. The non-bomb was the latest slap at <PERSON> Gotti </PERSON>, reputed boss of the Gambino crime family, who is besieged by law enforcers and mob rivals. In January a battalion of police officers, some of them posing as street vendors, arrested <PERSON> Gotti </PERSON> on the street near the Ravenite. They threw him against a wall, patted him down and read him his rights. <PERSON> Gotti </PERSON>, apparently stunned to be treated like a common criminal, asked, `` What's wrong with you guys?'' He was charged with ordering the shooting of a union official who had himself ordered the trashing of a restaurant owned by a <PERSON> Gambino </PERSON> family member. Meanwhile, prosecutors in a Mafia trial in <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> say members of the Genovese crime family, headed by <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> `` Chin'' <PERSON> Gigante </PERSON>, plotted to kill <PERSON> Gotti </PERSON> to stop him from infringing on their rackets. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents, in fact, warned <PERSON> Gotti </PERSON> in 1987 that he was the subject of such a murder plot. <PERSON> Gigante </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gotti </PERSON> are virtually the only major <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Mafia figures to have avoided long prison sentences. The Ravenite, which has been the subject of intense surveillance by investigators, is a simple storefront that sits inconspicuously on a street of colorful, lively Italian restaurants. The club has long been frequented by members of the Gambino crime family, notably <PERSON> Aniello </PERSON> <PERSON> Dellacroce </PERSON>, a professional murderer who became one of the family's two most powerful leaders. <PERSON> Dellacroce </PERSON> was <PERSON> Gotti </PERSON>'s patron, and after the older man died in 1985 <PERSON> Gotti </PERSON> allegedly ordered the murder of Gambino boss <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Castellano </PERSON> and seized control of the family.

 Rep. <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, striving to prevent damage to his race for the No. 2 leadership post among House Republicans, promised Monday to provide full accounting of his unusual book promotion deal. `` We'll check with our attorney and get it out into the open,'' said the <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> congressman, trying to distinguish his book deal from the one that led to ethics charges brought by <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> against <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. `` We were not trying to make a quick buck or arrange any sweetheart deal,'' he said at a news conference. Although the limited partnership formed for promotion was unusual in publishing, it was `` much like the arrangement used for producing and promoting a Broadway play,'' he said. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, clearly reveled in the attention being paid to his nemesis. `` People who live in glass houses should n't throw stones,'' he said. House Majority Whip <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, D-Calif., said <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> should expect to face an inquiry himself `` He should anticipate somebody filing charges ... and he'll have to live by the same standard he has set for others,'' <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> made `` a plea to you and the press and the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> public to listen and understand the truth,'' he said, but others `` asked for the same thing and <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> was n't always interested,'' <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> said. Three House Democrats _ Reps. <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> _ sent a letter to <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> late Monday asking that he answer a list of questions they said are raised by the promotion deal. The letter says the questions involve <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules, financial disclosure requirements, the Federal Election Campaign Act and the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> code. An article in Monday's <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said 21 investors put up $ 5,000 apiece to promote <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>'s 1984 book, `` Window of Opportunity.'' In exchange, the investors were to receive 45 percent of the profits, but there were n't any. They did, however, gain tax benefits from the arrangement, the article said. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Marianne </PERSON>, who co-authored the book, received `` less than $ 10,000'' from the $ 105,000 for her work in arranging the deal and coordinating the promotional efforts. Her tax benefit amounted to $ 26, <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> said. She said the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee was consulted before the partnership contracts were signed, and their earnings were fully disclosed as <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules require. `` I did a lot of work,'' she told reporters, adding that the book was still for sale and reciting a toll-free number if anybody wanted to buy. Contrasting his volume with the one <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> has privately published and sold, <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> said his book was `` a real book, 272 pages long, with real ideas, not a collection of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor speeches and memories,'' and it was sold in regular bookstores. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> said he held the news conference as soon as he could because he wanted to quickly dispel any notion of wrongdoing in the midst of his campaign for Minority Whip. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> is one of two announced candidates for the post, which became vacant when <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> was confirmed last week as Secretary of Defense. Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Madigan </PERSON>, R-Ill., is also campaigning for the position <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> said Monday he believes he has a majority of the 174 House Republicans committed to him, and that the article about his book deal would not hurt, except that it was a distraction for a few hours. Meantime, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee convened for its first full day of deliberations in <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s case, following three weeks of presentations and counter-arguments from its special counsel and <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s attorney. Chairman <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Calif., said the deliberations would go through Wednesday, but added he could not predict whether final decisions on the charges against <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> would be completed by then If not, the panel would reconvene early next month following the Easter recess, he said. Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, the senior Republican on the panel, said he expects the panel will act to release the full report of its independent counsel, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON>, but added that decision had not yet been made. Both men said they expected that whatever the final outcome, it would be bipartisan and not be the result of a polarized committee. The 12-member panel, unique in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, is evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans. Both also said they did not expect the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> leadership race to impact their deliberations, and <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> said he did not believe <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>'s book promotion deal would be relevant. `` They're two separate issues,'' he said. `` That is not an issue before the ethics committee and hopefully it will not be.'' Later, asked about the impact of the book deal on <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>'s chances, <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> added: `` I do n't see how they can help any. Mr. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, it poses, I think, some problems for him.'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION> reported Monday night that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> was a silent partner with a major savings and loan operator in a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> land development deal at the same time <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> was involved in legislation affecting the savings and loan industry. The deal involved a 20-acre parcel of land near <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, according to <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>. The land was subdivided into housing lots and <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> tripled his money in three years, making a $ 90,000 profit, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> said. One of the other buyers was <PERSON> RIchard </PERSON> <PERSON> Swann </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> lawyer who was chairman of the city's largest savings and loan, the network said. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, `` the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> story was utterly false. There was not even the slightest potential for a conflict of interest as <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> suggested. The whole underlying premise of that story is that there some connection to the S & amp; L issue, and it's just utterly and totally false.''

 A judge's last-minute intervention kept <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> in prison Monday as he was about to walk free after serving 12 years in prison on a controversial conviction for the killing of a police officer. District Judge <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> reset <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' bond at $ 100,000, superseding another judge's decision to release <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> simply on a promise to appear in court. The action, which culminated an afternoon of confusion among prosecutors, judges and defense attorneys, came after the District Attorney's office filed a motion to have state District Judge <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Baraka </PERSON> removed from the case. In another late development, prosecutors said for the first time that they were prepared to retry <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> since his conviction was overturned after being questioned in the film `` The Thin Blue Line.'' `` We are ready for a trial right now,'' said Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Winfield </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>. `` We could call and crank up this trial right now if you wanted us to. We're fully prepared to proceed with the trial.'' Prior to <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>'s comments, it was unknown whether prosecutors felt they had enough evidence to seek a new trail. <PERSON> Vance </PERSON>'s office, in filing the motion to have <PERSON> Baraka </PERSON> removed, charged that the judge was biased when he ruled there was not enough evidence in the original 1977 case to convict <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>. Judge <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> said 54th District Judge <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> would hear the motion Tuesday afternoon. If the judge rules that <PERSON> Baraka </PERSON> should not be removed from the case, <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> could be released under the $ 50,000 personal recognizance bond that <PERSON> Baraka </PERSON> set for him earlier Monday. But <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> said, `` Once the motion to recuse is filed, Judge <PERSON> Baraka </PERSON> has no other authority to do anything further on the case.'' <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Baraka </PERSON> are both state judges, but <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> presides as administrative judge for the region. Defense attorney <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaffer </PERSON> said <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> did not have the 10 percent necessary to post bail on the $ 100,000 bond. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> remained held in the <PERSON> Lew </PERSON> <PERSON> Sterrett </PERSON> Justice Center Monday night. `` I guarantee it's not tonight, and I do n't know when, if ever,'' <PERSON> Schaffer </PERSON> said on whether <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> would be able to post bail. District Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> said, `` I do n't think <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> ought to be out on the street. I think anybody that's indicted for killing a police officer is a danger to society.'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, 40, has steadfastly maintained his innocence in the 1976 shooting death of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> police officer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>. He originally was sentenced to death, but his sentence was commuted to life in prison in 1980. His conviction was unanimously overturned by the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> on March 1. The appeals court reviewed the case on the recommendation of <PERSON> Baraka </PERSON>, and agreed with his ruling that <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> did not receive a fair trial. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' case had been resurrected with the help of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> filmmaker <PERSON> Errol </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, whose documentary `` The Thin Blue Line'' suggested the slaying was committed by the prosecution's chief witness, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, who is on death row for another slaying, was not charged in the Wood shooting. He testified at <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' 1977 trial that <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> was driving a car that the police officer pulled over, and that <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> shot the officer. However, in a hearing before <PERSON> Baraka </PERSON> last December, <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> testified that <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> did not kill <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>. <PERSON> Schaffer </PERSON> also presented evidence at the December hearing that prosecutors had suppressed evidence at <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' trial. The district attorney's office earlier Monday filed a motion asking that <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' bond hearing be presented before a different judge. <PERSON> Baraka </PERSON> rejected the motion. `` There are no lengths they will not go to to pursue this man,'' <PERSON> Schaffer </PERSON> said. Prosecutors were not present in court, much to the annoyance of <PERSON> Schaffer </PERSON>. `` I've been to three goat ropings and a county fair and I've never seen this kind of childish behavior,'' <PERSON> Schaffer </PERSON> said Before <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>'s decision, <PERSON> Schaffer </PERSON> had said <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> planned to join his family in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, the filmmaker, called <PERSON> Baraka </PERSON>'s release order a `` wonderful step toward exoneration.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Denver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Symphony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orchestra </ORGANIZATION>'s 1989 spring season will end early with Saturday's concert because of a nearly $ 1 million shortfall, orchestra officials announced Monday. Symphony officials said they were canceling eight concerts remaining in the 1989 spring season, but said they hoped to reorganize the orchestra in time for the 1989-1990 season. They planned to have a proposal in hand by Aug. 1. `` We looked at every possible alternative before we were forced to make this decision,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Low </PERSON>, chairman of the symphony board, said at a news conference. `` Obviously, we can not continue to run without cash in the bank, and at this point in time we ca n't run until June,'' he said. `` We'll be back next year. ... We may have a reduced budget and a smaller season, but we're going to offer the same quality performances the <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> community demands and deserves.'' Last fall, a last-ditch community fund-raising campaign saved the symphony from a possible bankruptcy. But since then symphony officials have said they faced a $ 985,000 shortfall. People holding tickets for canceled concerts may receive credit for next season's concerts, but no cash refunds will be paid, officials said. The <ORGANIZATION> DSO </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement that conductor <PERSON> Philippe </PERSON> <PERSON> Entremont </PERSON>, who was in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, would not be at the last concerts scheduled Thursday, Friday and Saturday. <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> DSO </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, said it was <PERSON> Entremont </PERSON>'s decision not to perform this weekend She said she did not know if he would return to the symphony.

<DATELINE>PLANT CITY, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Baseball great <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> is under investigation for serious allegations, baseball Commissioner <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> said Monday, and one source said the <ORGANIZATION> Cincinnati </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reds </ORGANIZATION> manager faces possible suspension for gambling. The commissioner's office, in an unusual and carefully worded statement, did not say what the allegations were. <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> admits to a fondness for betting on horse and dog races, but has never been accused of betting on baseball. The usually effusive <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> declined comment on the investigation. `` If something happens, when it happens, I'll talk about it then,'' he said. The commissioner's statement was issued jointly with <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON> <PERSON> Giamatti </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> president who has been selected to replace <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON>. `` The office of the commissioner, which was founded to preserve the integrity of the game, has for several months been conducting a full inquiry into serious allegations involving Mr. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>,'' the statement said. `` When the commissioner's office has completed its inquiry, the commissioner will consider the information presented and take whatever action is warranted by the facts consistent with the rules and procedures of major league baseball,'' it continued. <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> from spring training on Feb. 20 to meet with <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON>, <PERSON> Giamatti </PERSON> and several lawyers. At the time, the commissioner's office said the matter was private, but several published reports said gambling was discussed. Not until Monday did baseball acknowledge it was investigating <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>. And one baseball source, who asked not to be identified, said that the statement `` was a prelude to what's going to happen in the next couple of days.'' He said <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> might be suspended for gambling activities. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dowd </PERSON>, a trial lawyer with the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> firm of <ORGANIZATION> Heron </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burchette </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ruckert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Rothwell </PERSON>, is leading the investigation as special counsel to the commissioner. The 47-year-old <PERSON> Dowd </PERSON> headed a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> organized crime task force from 1972 to 1978 and led investigations of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and of former <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Flood </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dowd </PERSON> said Monday that he had been investigating <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> for about a month and did not know how much longer the inquiry would last. He would not discuss the nature of the investigation. Baseball personnel are prohibited from betting on baseball games, but they are allowed to make legal bets at tracks, a common pasttime for baseball players and managers. Despite that, baseball personnel have been suspended for associating with gamblers. On one occasion last year, <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> said: `` I'm not supposed to gamble. They talked to me about that.'' <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> was suspended for 30 days last year for a scuffle with umpire <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Pallone </PERSON>. It was the longest suspension given a manager in 41 years. <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>, who has been <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>'s manager since August 1986, holds what is considered one of baseball's most unassailable records _ the most hits in a career, 4,256. He also has played in more games than any other player _ 3,562.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>, who tried to erase memories of his right-wing party's links to death squads that killed thousands of Salvadorans, celebrated his presidential victory Monday over the U.S.-backed government. <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mena </PERSON>, candidate of the incumbent <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, conceded defeat and told a news conference, `` I have called him -LRB- <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> -RRB- personally to congratulate him and express my desire that God illuminate him in governing the country.'' <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said the election result was not a defeat for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said it was prepared to support the new Salvadoran government but only if it protects democracy and human rights. <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, or <PERSON> Arena </PERSON>, will take over from President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> on June 1. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>, one of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s staunchest allies, had been unable to end a 9-year-old civil war with leftist rebels that has taken an estimated 70,000 lives. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>, barred by the constitution from seeking re-election, has said his proudest moment will come when he hands over power to an elected successor. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> suffers from terminal liver cancer. <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> immediately urged all political parties to `` put down their political banners and unite to ensure progress.'' He told a Monday news conference that his party `` does n't want a sectarian government.'' He also thanked <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mena </PERSON> for accepting `` in a very democratic manner the results of the elections.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elections </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> had 53.81 percent of the 576,339 votes counted from Sunday's election, compared to 36.59 percent for the centrist <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>. Trailing were the conservative <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conciliation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> with 4.21 percent and the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convergence </ORGANIZATION> at 3.2 percent. Other votes were divided among three smaller parties. `` Arena has won and I congratulate <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> publicly,'' said <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Perdomo </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> chairman of the council. He said final official results would not be announced until a recount is concluded Thursday. Agriculture Minister <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Morales </PERSON> <PERSON> Erlich </PERSON> estimated voter turnout at between 850,000 and 900,000 _ one of the lowest in Salvadoran history and less than half of those eligible. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador, had said a turnout of 60 percent or better would represent a defeat for the guerrilla strategy. <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mena </PERSON> conceded that <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> would win more than 50 percent of the vote, thus enabling him to evade a runoff election that would have been held next month between the top two contendes. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said: `` Our relationship with that new government will depend on its adherence to democracy and respect for human rights, the twin pillars of our approach to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>,'' said department spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON>. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> praised the <LOCATION> Salvadoran </LOCATION> people for braving `` violence and terror'' by leftist guerrillas who, he said, tried harder to disrupt Sunday's balloting than any other election here in seven years. White House Press Secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the elections `` represent a strong desire by the people of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> for the ability to participate in the election process.'' But he said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was `` concerned about the level of guerrilla attacks and human rights abuses'' during the balloting. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has supported <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> with $ 3.5 billion in aid this decade, and some congressmen have said the results leave much to be desired. <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>, a 41-year-old coffee-grower and businessman, said late Sunday he `` would be the president of all 5 million Salvadorans. We are going to unify this people in order to pull ourselves out of this profound crisis.'' <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> was linked in the early 1980s to rightist death squads blamed for the murders of tens of thousands of suspected leftists. <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> contends the party has changed significantly and his candidacy was evidence of that. But fanatical rightists remain prominent in the party, including party founder <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> d'Aubuisson </PERSON>, who was once called a `` pathological killer'' by a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador. <PERSON> D'Aubuisson </PERSON> has repeatedly denied links to death squads. <PERSON> D'Aubuisson </PERSON>, a former army major who was cashiered in 1980 for allegedly plotting a coup, is an Arena legislator. Although he holds no formal party post, he was the party's top drawing card at election rallies, where he was introduced as `` maximum leader.'' The election marked the first time Salvadoran voters had a chance to replace an incumbent civilian government with a distinctly different government. Guerrillas of the <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> tried to thwart the voting with a transport ban across the Massachusetts-sized country and attacks on military positions in 12 of the country's 14 provinces. The insurgents lifted the ban Monday and said that the high absentee rate proved their contention that <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON>'s problems could not be solved without their participation. At least 29 guerrillas and soldiers were killed in Sunday's fighting, as well as two civilians, according to Col. <PERSON> Emilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON>, chief of the joint chiefs of staff <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> the attacks constituted `` a nationwide offensive.'' Three journalists _ two Salvadorans and a Dutchman _ also were killed and a fourth seriously wounded by security forces over election weekend.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bridges </PERSON>, once a star of the TV series `` Diff ` rent Strokes,'' was ordered Monday to stand trial for attempted murder following testimony that he was high on cocaine every day for weeks before shooting a convicted drug Municipal Judge <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Horwitz </PERSON>, presiding at the preliminary hearing, determined there was enough evidence to try Bridges and set the 23-year-old former actor's <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> arraignment for Friday. The judge rejected a plea from Bridges' attorney to reduce the charge on grounds that Bridges was too drugged to form the intent to shoot his alleged victim. `` The defendant is grossly overcharged,'' said attorney <PERSON> Johnnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON>, who noted that witnesses said Bridges ingested rock cocaine at least four times the day of the shooting at a house that was a cocaine hangout. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Clay </PERSON>, the victim of the shooting, described the 23-year-old Bridges as `` based out'' from freebasing _ smoking cocaine _ when the shooting occurred Feb. 2. `` It was the worst I seen him,'' said <PERSON> Clay </PERSON>, 25. `` He looked like his eyes were about to jump out of his head. He'd lost a lot of weight, just was n't hisself.'' <PERSON> Clay </PERSON> described himself as a bodyguard at the house in south-central <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, where Bridges was living. He said he had seen Bridges have apparent epileptic seizures after consuming large amounts of cocaine, and once stuffed a towel in Bridges' mouth to keep him from swallowing his tongue. On Feb. 2, <PERSON> Clay </PERSON> said, Bridges came to the house and they argued. He said Bridges left and later returned with a gun and a friend, <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Duckett </PERSON>. When Bridges fired the gun, <PERSON> Clay </PERSON> said, <PERSON> Duckett </PERSON> urged him on, saying, `` Shoot him. Shoot him.'' <PERSON> Duckett </PERSON>, who has a long record of felony convictions, pleaded no contest to being an accessory in the case. However, he denied <PERSON> Clay </PERSON>'s account and said he did n't arrive until the shooting was over Authorities allege that Bridges shot Clay eight times. The actor, who appeared in jail garb Monday, has been unable to post $ 2 million bail. <PERSON> Horwitz </PERSON> refused a request from <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON> to lower the bail.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> told airlines and airports Monday there is a `` high and continuing risk'' of more devices like the bomb in a radio-cassette player that destroyed <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103, killing 270 people. The department said it sent a telex as a reminder of its previous warnings, which have been the subject of controversy, and to suggest new safety measures. Transport officials would not elaborate on the statement. Pressure grew for the government to explain whether the Flight 103 disaster on Dec. 21 could have been averted with better dissemination of warnings and information about bombing equipment found before the explosion over <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. Opposition politicians have demanded <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Channon </PERSON> resign because of how he handled events before the bombing, which killed all 259 people on the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 and 11 on the ground. The Evening Standard newspaper said police believe the bomb contained only one or two pounds of explosives, but its location near a weakened seam in the baggage hold increased its effect. Inspector <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> McCullough </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION> police, who are conducting the investigation, refused comment beyond saying the report was `` most likely speculation by the press.'' A source the Evening Standard did not identify was quoted as saying: `` If the bomb had been almost anywhere else it might have killed half a dozen people or maybe even just shredded some bags.'' In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, a member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> still is not following many anti-terrorism measures an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> security firm suggested to it more than two years ago. Rep. <PERSON> Cardiss </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, D-Ill., said in a letter to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> the security consultant concluded the airline was not careful enough in checking baggage, did a poor job of questioning passengers boarding planes and was slow in reacting to warnings of possible terrorist activity She quoted from reports <ORGANIZATION> KPI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> gave <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 after reviewing <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> security at nine airports, including <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. Flight 103 originated in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> and changed planes at <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION>. One of the <ORGANIZATION> KPI </ORGANIZATION> reports said: `` Pan Am is highly vulnerable to most forms of terrorist attack. The fact that no major disaster has occurred to date is merely providential.'' Opposition lawmakers in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> continued claiming Monday that the public was not given a full explanation of events before the bombing. <PERSON> Channon </PERSON> made no comment. He canceled a speech to an airline magazine conference and did not address Parliament after the second rejection of an opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> request to force him to speak. Labor and other opposition leaders want <PERSON> Channon </PERSON> to explain why a warning that might have alerted <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> to the type of bomb used was not sent until after the disaster. It was the second of two issued after the discovery Oct. 26 by <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> of explosives hidden in a radio-cassette player in the possession of suspect Palestinians. Monday's statement by the <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said: `` Since the discovery in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in October last year of an explosive device hidden in a radio, we have considered it possible that there might be other similar devices in existence in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> or elsewhere. `` In view of the high and continuing risk for electronic devices, the department has today by telex issued a further reminder to airports and airlines drawing attention to the guidance issued earlier and suggesting some further steps that should be taken.'' The first warnings were issued in November but <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> says it did not receive the second, more detailed, bulletin until Jan. 17. <PERSON> Channon </PERSON>'s department said the fact that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines were not told until January, a delay it said occurred because color photographs were being prepared, was not important because the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> provided similar information a month earlier. <PERSON> Channon </PERSON> also has been criticized for failing to tell <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> of either warning until last week and failing to order tighter airport security. <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Bachmeier </PERSON> of the West German <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said Monday that British experts attended a briefing Nov. 15 on the radio-cassette player found in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and `` they were in possession of all the information.'' <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Leyden </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Monday that his agency did not send a photograph of the explosive device to airlines. He said the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>'s Nov. 18 security alert to carriers contained technical details of the bomb and how it would work. He said it was n't until later that the West Germans developed material on the bomb that included photographs. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carriers serving <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> received the photograph from <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> authorities, he said.

 Top army and intelligence officials told the <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> must deal with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> if it wants to reach a settlement with Palestinians and end the uprising in the occupied territories, news reports said Monday. The reports came as Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> opened a conference of world Jewish leaders with a call for solidarity and won a standing ovation for equating the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> to the biblical murderers of the Jews. The daily newspapers <ORGANIZATION> Haaretz </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Yediot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ahronot </ORGANIZATION> said `` authorized elements of appraisal'' _ believed to be military and intelligence officials _ concluded the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> has made substantive changes and wants a `` realistic political settlement.'' That assessment was given to <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s Cabinet, along with the judgment that no dialogue with the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> was possible without the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, the newspapers said. According to the reports, the intelligence sources said the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> uprising could continue for years and be kept at manageable levels by the military, but it would not end without a political solution. <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, said the reports were inaccurate and misleading but would not comment further. A succession of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> governments have refused to deal with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> views as a terrorist group. However, some doves in the center-left <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> have recently advocated talking to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> as the only way to resolve the Palestinian problem. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> made it clear at the conference he had not softened in his approach to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. `` We have the power and determination to confront the Hamans of this generation and to expose their deception, their double-talk, and to rid the world of their venom and ideology once and for all,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Haman </PERSON> plotted to exterminate the Jews at the time of the Persian king Xerxes, the Book of <PERSON> Esther </PERSON> says. `` At times like this, when our people's desperate yearning for peace is questioned by some, we want our sisters and brothers to come forward and explode this blasphemy,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> declared. `` We may have our differences on how to achieve our dream of peace, but we are united ... that peace is our goal.'' In prepared remarks handed out earlier to reporters, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said agreeing to a Palestinian state in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> would not solve the problem. `` Our government is united in its opposition to the creation of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> state west of the <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` We are opposed to negotiations with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> because it will inevitably lead to a demand for a state.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said some delegates rose at an earlier closed meeting to recommend negotiations with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. President <PERSON> Chaim </PERSON> <PERSON> Herzog </PERSON> opened the conference of 1,100 Jewish leaders from 30 countries. `` We dare not underestimate the feelings expressed in the unrest, nor should we ... expect it to simply fade away,'' he said of the Palestinian uprising that began more than 15 months ago, in which 403 Palestinians and Israelis have been killed. `` There is no way but peace, no solution but through open, free, bilateral negotiations. `` This requires emergence of a fearless, sober <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> leadership ... which will abandon negation of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist, will abandon the path of violence and terror and will enter into negotiations without preconditions.'' A call for talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> by Deputy Finance Minister <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Beilin </PERSON>, an aide to Labor leader <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> brought criticism from members of <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s conservative <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc and predictions of an end to the Labor-Likud coalition. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> also suggested the coalition partners might divide over the peace issue. `` I think in the coming months we shall have to make up our mind,'' he said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio. `` If we can find a joint solution, fine. If not, we will have to make an historic choice.'' In <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> told a news conference <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> government is using a plan to halt the uprising that consists of `` escalating oppressive measures and intensifying the iron-fist polices against our people, while ... offering some new ideas on a settlement to the conflict ... aimed at distracting world opinion.'' He denied reports the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> asked the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> to halt military operations against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> as a condition of continuing a dialogue that began in December. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lifted a 13-year ban on dealing with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> after <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> publicly renounced terrorism and recognized <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> has the right to conduct `` all kinds of struggle'' against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, but indicated recent attacks were mounted by rival Palestinian factions to embarrass him. Israeli forces repelled four guerrilla incursions last week, including two from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and one each from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. Five guerrillas and one Israeli soldier were killed. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials meeting in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> on March 29 with <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelletreau </PERSON> will ask for active <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> involvement in efforts to convene an international peace conference on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace conference.

<HEAD>Former Minister Served Subpoena in Wife Attack Lawsuit</HEAD>

 A former Methodist minister found financially liable for an attack that has left his wife comatose said he will honor a subpoena he was confronted with when he came to town to visit his children. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> <PERSON> Railey </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> KDFW-TV </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> on Sunday that he has agreed to make his financial records available to the attorney who represents his wife's parents. <PERSON> Railey </PERSON> was served the subpoena Saturday morning as he approached the home of a friend who has custody of his two children. <PERSON> Railey </PERSON> said he was in town from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> to help his children celebrate their March birthdays. No criminal charges have been filed in the April 21, 1987, attack on <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Railey </PERSON>. But in a civil suit filed by Mrs. <PERSON> Railey </PERSON>'s parents against <PERSON> Railey </PERSON>, a state district judge awarded nearly $ 18 million in a default judgment. <PERSON> Railey </PERSON> was served the suit twice, but never responded to the allegation that he attacked his wife, though he denied it out of court. Despite the judge's ruling, Mrs. <PERSON> Railey </PERSON>'s parents, <PERSON> William </PERSON> and <PERSON> Billie </PERSON> <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicolai </PERSON>, have yet to collect any money from <PERSON> Railey </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON>, the attorney for the Nicolais, subpoenaed <PERSON> Railey </PERSON> for questioning about his financial status last week. `` This is just part of the process. The judge found him liable for trying to kill his wife,'' said <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> said. `` This is just the next step in trying to find what assets he had. It will never make <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Railey </PERSON> whole, but it's the only thing we have left to do.'' <PERSON> Railey </PERSON> said he did n't respond to the earlier subpoenas because `` I had nothing to gain in the suit and I did n't have the money to go to court.'' <PERSON> Railey </PERSON> has denied any knowledge of the attack that left his wife in a coma. Mrs. <PERSON> Railey </PERSON> is in a nursing home and doctors say she is not expected to recover. <PERSON> Railey </PERSON> has said he was working late the night of the attack and returned to find his wife near death. But there were several inconsistencies in the information <PERSON> Railey </PERSON> provided to police about his whereabouts on the night of the attack. Eight days after the attack he took an overdose of pills on the morning police wanted to question him. He wrote a note saying he felt besieged by demons. <PERSON> Railey </PERSON>, then pastor of the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, eventually surrendered his church credentials, citing increasing stress from the attack and the investigation. Later, he turned custody of his children over to friends and moved to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>.

 Ships searched the Gulf of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> around two badly burned oil platforms Monday but found no trace of seven men missing after explosions and fires swept through the platforms Sunday night. Thirty-five men escaped the blazing platforms, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>. Ten of those were injured, two critically. The side-by-side oil production platforms, which were connected by catwalks, erupted in flames about 7:30 p.m. Sunday. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said men were working on natural gas lines at the time of the fires, but a spokesman for owner <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Richfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said the cause was unknown Monday. `` There was work going on,'' said company spokesman <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Sims </PERSON>, `` but we do n't know if it was the cause.'' <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> had no assessment of loss and said he did not know how severely the two platforms were damaged. <ORGANIZATION> ARCO </ORGANIZATION> identified five of its employees who were among the seven missing. It said the other two were employees of contractors working aboard the rigs. The missing <ORGANIZATION> ARCO </ORGANIZATION> workers were <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Meadville </LOCATION>, Miss.; <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Elba </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Henson </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <PERSON> DeRidder </PERSON>, <LOCATION> La </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Pritchard </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> J.B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Suharto </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> on assignment with <ORGANIZATION> ARCO </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION>. The two contractors were not identified. Both the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> ARCO </ORGANIZATION> suspended their search after sundown Monday. Quartermaster 1st Class <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Kephart </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> was deciding whether to resume searching Tuesday morning. <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> ARCO </ORGANIZATION> and other rig operators in the area would continue searching Tuesday, but `` at a reduced level,'' with just two boats at their disposal. <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> said searchers boarded one of the platforms during the day, but found no survivors or bodies. The other platform, the one where the fire started, was much more badly damaged. `` There is some question about the integrity of the structure and whether we can get on it in a safe manner,'' said <PERSON> Sims </PERSON>. `` We'll be looking at that tomorrow.'' The two platforms, just off the southeast tip of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, were about 50 to 100 feet apart, with living quarters on one. Coast Guard Petty Officer <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Morehead </PERSON> said 42 people were believed to be aboard the <ORGANIZATION> ARCO </ORGANIZATION> platforms when the fires broke out. Helicopters and boats rescued the survivors, some of whom jumped directly into the water while others fled the platforms in covered, capsule-like life boats. <PERSON> Morehead </PERSON> said an oil slick two miles long and about 100 yards wide extended from the structures. The 10 injured men were taken to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Marrero </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> suburb, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Lynne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pourciau </PERSON>.

 Local and international journalists Monday mourned three colleagues killed while covering the election and demanded that government and rebel forces commit themselves to respect reporters' lives. More than 1,000 journalists were in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> for Sunday's presidential election, and many joined in funeral processions Monday for the two Salvadorans slain by security forces A Dutch cameraman was killed when army troops attacked a guerrilla-held village. The armed forces insisted the weekend slayings were isolated incidents but announced an army corporal had been arrested in one of the killings. Col. <PERSON> Emilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON>, head of the joint chiefs of staff, said the killings did not demonstrate a policy to hinder journalists. Air force troopers killed <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Navas </PERSON>, 30, and seriously wounded <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Galdamez </PERSON>, 34, near a roadblock on the outskirts of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> Saturday night. Both were photographers for the <ORGANIZATION> Reuter </ORGANIZATION> news agency. The armed forces said the two were on <PERSON> Navas </PERSON>' motorcycle and stopped at one roadblock but drove through another checkpoint. <PERSON> Galdamez </PERSON> said they stopped at a checkpoint and identified themselves and then were shot after proceeding. <PERSON> Mauricio </PERSON> <PERSON> Pineda </PERSON>, a 26-year-old soundman for a local television station, was killed Sunday morning by a soldier in the eastern province of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miguel </LOCATION>. The army acknowledged <PERSON> Pineda </PERSON> was shot without provocation and said a corporal implicated in the killing was under arrest and would be turned over to civilian authorities for trial. <PERSON> Cornel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lagrouw </PERSON>, 30, a camerman for the Dutch television network <ORGANIZATION> IKON </ORGANIZATION>, was fatally wounded during a gunfight Sunday between rebels and troops in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <PERSON> Javier </PERSON>, a town 70 miles east of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. Journalists with <PERSON> Lagrouw </PERSON> said he was standing next to some guerrillas when he was struck in the chest by a bullet fired from an army position. The local <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correspondents </ORGANIZATION> did not blame the army for the shooting but condemned the crew of an air force helicopter that jounalists said fired at the car they were using to take the dying Lagrouw to a hospital. The journalists said the car was flying white flags and was identified as a news vehicle with large letters `` TV'' taped on the windshield, roof and sides. About 300 journalists and other friends and relatives were in the procession Monday morning as <PERSON> Navas </PERSON>' body was taken to a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> cemetery. Many reporters also attended the afternoon ceremony for <PERSON> Pineda </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lagrouw </PERSON> was a resident of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, and Nicaraguan President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> sent condolences Monday to the <ORGANIZATION> Nicaraguan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correspondents </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Lagrow </PERSON> was a member of the association. The statement by the <ORGANIZATION> Salvadoran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correspondents </ORGANIZATION> said: `` Our efforts in zones of conflict to keep the people informed demands respect and guarantees. We demand that the parties to the conflict take the necessary measures so that such respect and guarantees are an everyday reality.'' It was directed to the armed forces and the rebels <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Ponce </LOCATION> spoke to leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correspondents </ORGANIZATION> Sunday night and told them, `` Though they -LRB- the shootings -RRB- happened in a brief lapse, this kind of incident is isolated. It does not represent any policy or desire on the part of the armed forces to intimidate journalists or keep them from doing their job.'' <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said Monday of the shootings: `` Obviously it is a tragedy. `` Now it is for the government to look into it and if there is culpability, then punish those guilty.

<TEXT>
 A sting operation has dealt a `` body blow'' to a brisk methamphetamine trade by targeting alleged drug dealers who ranged from health care workers to gang members, officials said Monday. `` This is the largest single enforcement operation directed against illicit drug manufacturers ever undertaken in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' said agent <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. Ninety-one people were charged in 27 separate federal indictments, unsealed Monday, with manufacture and distribution of methamphetamine, an illegal stimulant known as `` speed,'' `` meth'' or `` crystal.'' In addition, 29 methamphetamine labs were seized, state Attorney General <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamp </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Donohue </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, agent in charge of the local office of the state <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Narcotic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION>, said 78 people were in custody and authorities had seized about 20 pounds of methamphetamine and at least 38 weapons, including combat assault rifles and one Uzi submachine gun. The first arrests came Sunday as 350 officers from several law enforcement agencies made sweeps of homes in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and Mammoth Lakes in the <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>. More arrests were planned, <PERSON> Donohue </PERSON> said. The sting involved the placement of an undercover state agent inside a legitimate retail chemical supplier, <ORGANIZATION> Triple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Neck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scientific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, with the owner's consent. Starting last June, the agent made contact with customers buying chemicals and equipment for making methamphetamine and other illegal drugs, said <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamp </PERSON>. Methamphetamine makers in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> are n't limited to the `` traditional subculture of outlaw motorcycle gangs,'' the attorney general said. `` Only half those arrested in this operation fit that description. Among the other half, we had people like a retired pharmacist, and a registered nurse. ... We found whole families involved in the drug trade,'' he said. `` This gigantic sting will deal a body blow to the methamphatamine trade in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamp </PERSON> added. <PERSON> Donohue </PERSON> said <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> `` has the dubious distinction of being the meth capital of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' Nearly half of the illegal methamphetamine labs in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are located in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> has led the nation in the number of labs seized for each of the past five years, according to federal figures.

 <PERSON> Heidi </PERSON> <PERSON> Holland </PERSON> has made the journey from off-Broadway to <LOCATION> Broadway </LOCATION> with her wit and wisdom intact. In fact, she has gotten better, although she'd be the first to deny it. <PERSON> Heidi </PERSON> is the insecure heroine of `` The <PERSON> Heidi </PERSON> <PERSON> Chronicles </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wasserstein </PERSON>'s funny feminist travelogue that takes theatergoers from the late 1960s to the present. The play, now on view at Broadway's <ORGANIZATION> Plymouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theater </ORGANIZATION> after a successful run at Playwrights Horizons, remains one of the unqualified joys of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> theater season In a series of sketches, <PERSON> Wasserstein </PERSON> traces <PERSON> Heidi </PERSON>'s changing ideas about herself, about men and about other women. <PERSON> Heidi </PERSON>, an art historian, may not embrace every trend, notion or belief that pops up during her 20-year <PERSON> Odyssey </PERSON>, but she examines them with a discerning attitude that is rich in humor and not above a little anger. Director <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> has enlarged the production for Broadway, but he has n't diluted its effectiveness. Large slide projections that pinpoint specific historical moments _ from <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> War protests to the first rumbles of women's as well as gay liberation _ enhance its appeal. Snippets of old pop music also help anchor the play in the particular time periods. At the center of the play stands <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>'s radiant performance as <PERSON> Heidi </PERSON>. She projects an intelligence and likability that never waver during the character's many moments of self-doubt. It's a richly drawn portrait. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> has polished his performance as the egocentric baby-boomer publisher who is in love with <PERSON> Heidi </PERSON> but marries someone else. He's arrogance at its most ingratiating. <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaines </PERSON> is funny and at times poignant as a sardonic but caring baby doctor. <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, the one new addition to the cast, demonstrates her virtuosity in two roles _ as a flower child in a hilarious women's rap session and as an ambitious corporate groupie of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> years. <PERSON> Wasserstein </PERSON> has had some off-Broadway successes, most notably `` Is n't It Romantic'' and `` Uncommon Women and Others.'' `` The Heidi Chronicles'' is her Broadway debut, and it's something to cheer.

 American audiences deserve to see the Royal National Theater of <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, but not the company of actors sent overseas by its educational division with a ragtag version of `` Macbeth.'' The production, now on view at the Harry DeJur Playhouse, toured colleges and universities across the country before coming to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for a two-week run. <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>'s shortest play has been made even shorter in this production, performed at just over two hours with no intermission. It just seems longer. Director <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> has a concept but not a play. This is bare bones <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON> _ with no scenery and tattered, grimy all-purpose costumes. Eight actors play all the roles. When not acting, they sit trance-like on benches located on three sides of the stage. That dispassion carries over to their performances. <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Drury </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Nicol </PERSON> <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON> look-alike, possesses a resonant voice but it has little emotion. At least a quivering <PERSON> Amelda </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> suggests <PERSON> Lady </PERSON> <PERSON> Macbeth </PERSON>'s obsession with power. Nothing else in this forlorn revival seems alive.

 In an extraordinary public confession, Prime Minister <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> tearfully admitted to a national TV audience Tuesday he had been unfaithful to his wife of 33 years. <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> made the admission in a taped interview on Channel 7's Newsworld program that was to be aired Tuesday night The network and the Prime Minister's Office released a transcript of the interview. <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON>, 59, acknowledged reports of his womanizing, saying it was in the past. He pledged his love for his wife, <PERSON> Hazel </PERSON>, calling her an `` incredible woman.'' Newspapers led their front pages with the story. The Sydney Morning Herald headlined: `` <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> In Tears: How I Cheated On Hazel'' and the Daily Mirror of <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION> read: `` ` I Was Unfaithful To <PERSON> Hazel </PERSON>,' PM's Amazing TV Admission.'' The last time <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> broke down on television was when he referred in 1984 to drug problems among members of his family. Mrs. <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> later went on television to explain that their daughter, <PERSON> Roslyn </PERSON>, and her husband, <PERSON> Matt </PERSON>, had been treated for heroin addiction. A spokesman for <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> said Tuesday's admission was not new. `` All this has been said before,'' said the official, who is not allowed to be named. <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> has said he will seek a record fourth term as prime minister. In the interview, <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> was asked what people mean when they accuse him of being a womanizer. `` They mean I was unfaithful to my wife,'' <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> replied. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>: `` Is that true?'' <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON>: `` Yes.'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>: `` Did you stop that?'' `` Yes,'' <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> replied in tears, and then, `` I guess there are not many women who would have put up with me all that time.

<TEXT>
 Two sisters taken hostage by a gunman apparently were shot before police stormed a barricaded house to end a 42-hour standoff, a police official said Monday, denying witness reports that suggested the women were still alive. Police also speculated that a sexual-abuse investigation of the gunman, <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> `` Dougie'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, might have prompted the hostage situation. It ended Sunday night when <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> fatally shot his girlfriend, 20-year-old <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Lambert </PERSON>, wounded her sister and then took his own life. The wounded hostage, <PERSON> Nicole </PERSON> <PERSON> Lambert </PERSON>, 14, was in critical condition Monday at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> after surgery for a gunshot wound in her head, said hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Aggie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayner </PERSON>. Police said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, 20, took four hostages late Friday at the home of <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Lambert </PERSON>, mother of <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nicole </PERSON> <PERSON> Lambert </PERSON>. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, whom police described as `` deranged,'' threatened to kill the sisters, as well as <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Lambert </PERSON>'s daughters, <PERSON> Katrina </PERSON>, 4, and <PERSON> Kelisa </PERSON>, 2 -LCB- months. The two small children were released over the course of the next 42 hours while police surrounded the house and tried to convince <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> to surrender. Officials decided to storm the house after <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> took a telephone on which he had been talking to police and threw it out a window, according to <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> Police Chief <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Walton </PERSON>. Moments later, police fired two volleys of tear gas and broke through the barricaded front door of the house. The two women were found shot and wrapped in quilts just inside the door, police said. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> was found lying on top of them with a self-inflicted gunshot wound in his chest. The Springfield State Journal-Register quoted two witnesses as saying they heard screaming as police tried to break through the door, and that the screams stopped before officers entered the house. But Police Cmdr. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, who said he accompanied the Emergency Response Team that stormed the house, said no gunshots were heard immediately before or during the assault. Asked whether he believed the women were shot before the tear gas was fired, <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> said, `` Absolutely. When, I do n't know, but it was some time earlier.'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, said by relatives to have been released from prison last year after serving three years for a 1985 shooting, had been under investigation by police for possible criminal sexual abuse as a result of a complaint filed on behalf of a minor, police spokesman <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON> said. While declining to give details, he said the sexual-abuse probe `` could involve one of the hostages'' and might have prompted the rampage.

 Sabotaged electrical and telephone service hampered election officials' plan for a quick vote count in the presidential election. The plan had been for each of more than 260 voting location in 14 provinces to transmit facsimiles of its returns by telephone to the national <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> in the capital Sunday night after the polls closed. Election officials had said they expected to have preliminary returns on election night. That turned out to be optimistic. At midnight on election night the council announced it was suspending the count because of `` technical'' problems with the computer. On Monday morning, <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON>, the council member who represents the rightist <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, or <PERSON> Arena </PERSON>, told reporters that returns were not yet in from some areas affected by power outages. Leftist rebels lifted their transport ban on Monday, but on election day there were reports that returns could not be delivered because of dangerous conditions on the roads. Basic service like telephones and electricity are favorite guerrilla targets and more than half the nation's electrical grid is not working. Instead of trying to transmit the results by FAX, poll officials said, the ballots and tally sheets would have to be brought from all over this Massachusetts-sized to the capital. Final official results might not come until as late as Thursday. But even though official results were not available, the parties made predictions about the outcome based on unofficial results from their own poll watchers. Arena claimed victory with more than 50 percent of the vote Sunday, and the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> conceded, even though only 130,000 votes had been officially counted at the time. Turnout was thought to be between 50 and 60 percent of the nation's 1.8 million registered voters.

<HEAD>Judge Says Widow Can't Have Insurance Both Ways</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LARGO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An appeals court has denied a widow's claim for $ 100,000 in life insurance, saying it could n't create a `` legal purgatory'' in which her brain-dead husband could be judged dead for life insurance and alive for his medical insurance. The judges suggested a change in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s insurance laws. <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Kepler </PERSON>, 49, suffered a heart attack May 28, 1986. It left him with extensive, irreversible brain damage and he was in a vegetative state in a hospital for 11 months. He was pronounced dead April 29, 1987, 20 days after the family obtained a court order allowing doctors to withhold food and water. That date also was 10 days after expiration of his term life insurance policy, the only life insurance he had. Family attorney <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Marger </PERSON> contended <PERSON> Kepler </PERSON> died when he suffered the heart attack, since paramedics revived his heart rate and breathing but he never regained consciousness or more than minimal brain function. <PERSON> Marger </PERSON> said his position was supported by public policy set by courts in at least three other states concerning the time of death `` where the dying process is interfered with by artificial means.'' A <LOCATION> Pinellas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> judge rejected that argument, as did the <ORGANIZATION> 2nd </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeal </ORGANIZATION> last month. `` Under any acceptable definition of ` death,' Mr. <PERSON> Kepler </PERSON> did not die before the expiration of his life insurance policy,'' the appeals court ruled. `` We can not rewrite the contract between the parties. `` While the plaintiff's argument would provide a comforting solution in this case, it would create numerous problems in other cases.'' The judges said they could not invent a `` legal purgatory'' in which <PERSON> Kepler </PERSON> would have been dead for life insurance purposes but alive so medical insurance could cover the remaining time he was hospitalized. But in the same ruling, the judges said the case suggests the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> should pass a law to automatically extend the coverage of term life insurance policies when the insured is in a chronic vegetative state. Term life insurance pays benefits if the insured dies during a certain period. Premiums are less than for whole life insurance, which has no expiration date, provides larger benefits and offers investment opportunities. The judges said they could foresee people forced `` to balance their love for a family member against their needs in the future for life insurance proceeds.'' <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, who represented <PERSON> Kepler </PERSON>'s insurer, <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said extended coverage as the court suggested would require increased premiums and negate the attraction of term life insurance `` We sympathize with her,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said of widow <PERSON> Lynnette </PERSON> <PERSON> Kepler </PERSON>, 45, who was married to <PERSON> Kepler </PERSON> 20 years and had four children with him. `` She got a bum deal but it was n't the fault of the insurance company.'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said the company could not voluntarily pay the $ 100,000 she was seeking because of the precedent it would set and the concern it would raise among stockholders.

 Police had to use tear gas to break up a melee Monday between about 50 Jewish feminists trying to worship at the sacred Western Wall and angry Orthodox men who hurled chairs, bottles and fruit at the women. The ultra-Orthodox men apparently feared the women would try to repeat past feminist efforts to carry the Bible _ which Jewish tradition says only men may do _ and don the prayer shawls worn exclusively by male Jews. Orthodox tradition has a virtual monopoly on religious affairs in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. One woman was slightly injured by a chair that struck her head and neck, police spokesman <PERSON> Uzi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sandori </PERSON> said. He said there were no arrests. The Western Wall, also known as the Wailing Wall, is Judaism's holiest site It is the only remaining wall of the ancient Jewish temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 A.D.. After the women entered a specified women's prayer area, Orthodox men stormed the cordoned-off section and threw chairs, fruit, and `` anything they put their hands on'' at the praying women, <PERSON> Sandori </PERSON> said Ushers who work at the Western Wall tried to protect the women and warded off the men, but police only firing tear gas after a woman began bleeding when she was hit by a chair, <PERSON> Sandori </PERSON> said. He said the police did not act earlier because they are not allowed to interfere in a religious area unless called in by the <ORGANIZATION> Religious </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Amihud </PERSON> <PERSON> Bahat </PERSON>, a spokesman for the ministry, said the women at the wall had deliberately left their prayer shawls and Bible at home and did nothing against the rules. `` They are feminists but they behaved appropriately,'' he said, adding they were welcome to pray at the wall in the future.

More than 100 million acres of farm land are expected to be insured this year, compared with about 75 million acres in 1988, says <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Gantz </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurers </ORGANIZATION>. `` It is a gigantic record,'' he said, adding that up to 150 million acres could be covered if conditions remain dry through the April 15 deadline for signing up for federally subsidized multi-peril crop insurance. Rainfall has been in short supply so far this year, scaring many farmers who watched their fields and pocketbooks shrivel during last year's long, hot and dry summer across the Farm Belt.

 The 5,000 `` new'' words in the second edition of the Oxford English Dictionary say more about the glacial pace of lexicography than about the age of the words. There are freshly minted terms such as AIDS-related, antiquark, fax, <ORGANIZATION> Filofax </ORGANIZATION> and ghetto-blaster; words or word senses redolent of the 1960s such as acid, downer, grok and chopper, and jazz-age coinages such as Big Apple. There's even one new word from Anglo-Saxon: `` ash,'' the symbol that combines the letters A and E. The second edition, to be published March 29, reflects more than a century of scholarly labor.

<HEAD>Diverse Collection of Nominees for Oscar's Best Actor</HEAD>

 A boy who turns into a man. An autistic genius. A Swedish peasant. A hard-bitten <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent. A dedicated math teacher. Has there ever seem such a diverse collection of nominees for best actor? Each performance seems unique, creating a difficult choice for Academy voters. <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Hackman </PERSON> has been in Oscar contention before. He was nominated for supporting performances in `` <PERSON> Bonnie </PERSON> and Clyde'' -LRB- 1967 -RRB- and `` I Never Sang for My Father'' -LRB- 1970 -RRB-, and won the big prize as the relentless <PERSON> Popeye </PERSON> <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON> in `` The French Connection'' -LRB- 1971 -RRB-. <PERSON> Hackman </PERSON>, 58, is one of those actors who seems to get better with age. He gets kidded about his lack of selectivity _ last year he appeared in five films within three months _ but invariably he draws praise from critics and his fellow actors. His one memorable film of 1988 was `` Mississippi Burning,'' for which he was nominated. As the Southern sheriff turned <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent, <PERSON> Hackman </PERSON> once more brought depth to what could have been a surface role. `` I always manage to find a way in films to be a bit introspective,'' he said in a recent magazine interview. `` It helps me as an actor, makes me feel as if I'm doing something important.'' <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Sydow </PERSON>'s nomination as the downtrodden farmhand in `` Pelle the Conqueror'' was a rarity: He won the recognition speaking a foreign language. Only one Oscar has ever been awarded to a performer in a subtitled film: <PERSON> Sophia </PERSON> <PERSON> Loren </PERSON> for `` Two Women.'' Although he has been acclaimed as a star of <PERSON> Ingmar </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergman </PERSON> films and international movies, <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Sydow </PERSON>, 66, has had no Academy recognition until now. `` I am not American and I am not English,'' he says, `` so my choice of parts in English-language films is limited.'' <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Sydow </PERSON> was delighted with his `` Pelle'' role because it allowed him to use his own childhood dialect; like the character <PERSON> Lasse </PERSON>, he grew up in a small Swedish town. He liked the role because it offered `` such a great variety of emotion. In every new scene there is a new situation and a new attitude from the man.'' Although <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> had a breakthrough nomination last year with `` Good Morning, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>,'' comedy has traditionally been held in low regard by Academy voters. Now <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanks </PERSON> is trying to break that tradition as a nominee for `` Big.'' He made a comedic gem out of the role of 13-year-old <PERSON> Josh </PERSON> <PERSON> Baskin </PERSON> who overnight is granted his wish to become a grownup. For <PERSON> Hanks </PERSON>, 32-year-old graduate of sitcom -LRB- `` Bosom Buddy'' -RRB-, the role required no method-actor searching for identity. `` I just imagined what it would be like to be a 13-year-old,'' he says simply. `` The kid is on the immature side,'' <PERSON> Hanks </PERSON> adds, `` and I must say I was much the same when I was his age. It was n't until I was 14 that I started growing up and becoming highly intelligent and debonair.'' Two of the other nominees for best actor faced more difficult transformations. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Olmos </PERSON>, the slim, laconic Lt. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> of TV's `` Miami Vice,'' shaved his mustache, thinned his hair and added 40 pounds to portray <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> teacher <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Escalante </PERSON> in `` Stand and Deliver.'' The Bolivia-born <PERSON> Escalante </PERSON> attracted wide attention by inspiring his students to such high academic achievements that they were suspected of cheating. `` What motivates <PERSON> Escalante </PERSON> is the sheer love of teaching,'' observes <PERSON> Olmos </PERSON>, 42. `` When he see the light in a student's eyes, it's a natural high, like adrenalin. He needs it, like a performer who needs applause.'' <PERSON> Olmos </PERSON> himself has been attracting applause since his appearance as the macho narrator of <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON>' play and the 1971 movie, `` Zoot Suit.'' His role as Lt. <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> won him the Emmy. <PERSON> Dustin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> exerted his customary thoroughness in preparing for his role as <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbit </PERSON>, the autistic man with a genius for numbers in `` Rain Man.'' After reading the initial script, he puzzled over the paradox of a man whose autism crippled him for normal living, but who nevertheless could perform superhuman feats of calculation. For a year, <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> visited with autistic savants and their families and talked with medical experts about the phenomenon. Out of his research came the portrayal of a man who seemingly could not converse with anyone, yet was capable of surprising flashes of wisdom. <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>, 51, had plenty of time to prepare as `` Rain Man'' underwent changes of directors and scripts. In the first days under director <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Levinson </PERSON>, the actor remained unsatisfied. But the pair finally reached agreement. `` It's like in baseball,'' he says, `` you hit a home run and then you start popping up. What you're trying to do is just connect, meet the ball. In the movies, you're trying to make contact. But not until it's over do you find out where it went.''

<HEAD>Sensitive Roles: A Road to the Oscar</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN HORN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>HOLLYWOOD (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Portraying the physically or mentally impaired presents a challenge to film actors, who must make the part credible as well as sensitive. Academy Award voters have rewarded several for their efforts with the coveted Oscar. This year, <PERSON> Dustin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanks </PERSON> are competing for the best actor prize, based on their roles as adults with diminished mental capacities. As critics noted, both infused their parts with credibility, keeping their characters grounded in the realities of their predicaments, rather than playing Tinsel Town cliches. `` <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> is fun ... but he had to be more restrained,'' said director <PERSON> Penny </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>. `` Innocent and shy was better than loud and brash and broad. If -LRB- his character -RRB- is just skipping down the block and making silly faces, I do n't think you get involved with the movie. `` Basically, you have to not act like what you think a child acts like, but get in touch with the child inside of you.'' Indeed, both actors found the key to their depictions from within. `` I simply pretended I was 12 years old. That's all I did,'' said the 32-year-old <PERSON> Hanks </PERSON> of his role as <PERSON> Josh </PERSON> <PERSON> Baskin </PERSON>, a child locked in a man's body in `` Big.'' <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>, who plays a compulsive autistic savant in `` Rain Man,'' discovered the secret to <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> by examining his own fastidious acting habits. `` I suddenly realized that I was playing off myself because I know something about obsession and I'm comfortable being obsessive,'' the 51-year-old actor said `` The rest of it just took care of itself.'' Such introspection brought more than believability to `` Rain Man'' and `` Big.'' It also allowed both actors to touch on emotions not limited to their character's situation. In `` Rain Man,'' for example, <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>'s autistic savant was used not for melodrama but to illuminate the fear of the unknown and the desire for order that many of us share. And as a youngster suddenly thrust into a cutthroat corporate environment, <PERSON> Hanks </PERSON> hinted that innocence and fairness can, in the end, prevail. Yet, given their subject matter, both films ran the risk of falling into <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> formula, where complicated disorders are reduced to plot devices, and multidimensional people with disabilities are simplified for audience appeal. Actors such as Oscar-winner <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicholson </PERSON> -LRB- as a renegade mental patient in 1975's `` One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'' -RRB- and Emmy-winner <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Drake </PERSON> -LRB- the mildly retarded office clerk on `` L.A. Law'' -RRB- have been singled out for accurately portraying the mentally impaired. And Academy Award voters and film critics have praised a variety of other actors playing characters with mental and physical impairments: <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyman </PERSON> won an Oscar for playing a deaf-mute in 1948's `` <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Belinda </PERSON>''; <PERSON> Patty </PERSON> <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> was awarded a statuette for her depiction of <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Keller </PERSON> in 1962's `` The Miracle Worker.'' <PERSON> Marlon </PERSON> <PERSON> Brando </PERSON> was commended for his performance as an injured war veteran for 1950's `` The Men''; <PERSON> Cliff </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> won an Oscar for playing a man with mental retardation in 1968's `` Charly''; <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Voight </PERSON> took the best actor prize for playing a paraplegic in 1978's `` Coming Home''; <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Malkovich </PERSON> was a best supporting actor nominee for his role as a blind border in 1984's `` Places in the Heart. And <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Laughton </PERSON> suffered pounds of daily makeup and folded their bodies into contorted positions for sensitive roles they played. For his lead in 1980's `` The Elephant Man,'' Hurt received a nomination for best actor. <PERSON> Laughton </PERSON> won critical and industry praise in 1939's `` The Hunchback of Notre Dame.'' But many others have been faulted for overblown, inaccurate representations. <PERSON> Josie </PERSON> <PERSON> Abady </PERSON> directed the play `` The Boys Next Door,'' about four mentally handicapped men in a group home. `` Like all people, people who are handicapped are funny, they're pathetic, they're great,'' <PERSON> Abady </PERSON> said `` You just think cheap shot, and you've got the stereotype,'' <PERSON> Drake </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>'s character and my character both have a full range of emotion. And that seems to surprise people _ that the characters can feel as much as they feel, and note as much as they note.'' As originally written by <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrow </PERSON>, `` Rain Man'' described <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>'s autistic character as `` an overgrown Cabbage Patch doll,'' a person with the lovable, huggable habits of the mentally retarded as typically seen through entertainment industry eyes. `` But <PERSON> Dustin </PERSON> suggested that it would be more interesting if the guy was more autistic, more quirky and less cuddly,'' said `` Rain Man'' co-screenwriter <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Bass </PERSON>. `` The idea is that there would be two autistic characters _ the <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> character who is clinically autistic and the Charlie character -LRB- a coldhearted car salesman played by <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruise </PERSON> -RRB- who is emotionally autistic. `` In this situation, you do n't fall in love with <PERSON> Dustin </PERSON> right away,'' <PERSON> Bass </PERSON> said. `` He's a difficult guy, and just when you think what he's doing is kind of cute and sweet, he does something completely weird.'' <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>'s depiction of autism was much better than what he's seen in the past, said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Zitnay </PERSON>, executive director of the <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. Foundation <PERSON> Zitnay </PERSON> said movies tend to depict the disabled `` as being much more disabled than they really are. ... My attitude has always been that films have done a disservice to persons with mental retardation.'' As the creators of `` Rain Man'' tried to be true to the autism disorder, the makers of `` Big'' also chose not to let the script or its star resort to shtick. `` It's such a high-concept idea that there's a huge temptation to just play the jokes and not the emotion or character,'' said `` Big'' co-writer <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>. `` But I think -LRB- the movie -RRB- lets us reveal a lot about the adult world, using <PERSON> Josh </PERSON> as a mirror: that we all have a child inside us and we all can operate childishly. As soon as you start trying to figure -LRB- the character -RRB- out intellectually, you lose it.''

 Five impressive performances have made the competition for best supporting actress one of the most difficult to predict in recent Academy history. The portrayals are diverse: a secretary, a dog trainer, a bigot's wife, a French noblewoman, a business executive Three of the actresses are in the early stages of promising careers, two are unquestioned stars. <PERSON> Sigourney </PERSON> <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON> is the only one of the five to have been nominated before: as the female Rambo in `` Aliens,'' 1986. This year she finds herself in two categories, as leading actress in `` Gorillas in the Mist'' and supporting actress in `` Working Girl.'' <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON>, 39, has been praised for her bravery in both films: for working with the gorillas, and for taking a secondary role as the duplicitous boss of <PERSON> Melanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON> in `` Working Girl.'' `` It's a very funny role as a Wall Street tycoon-shark or ` sharkess,'' <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON> said. `` The film really stars <PERSON> Melanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, but I have a very juicy supporting role. I thought it was a good antidote to the hardship and sadness of -LRB- ` Gorillas in the Mist' -RRB-.'' <PERSON> Geena </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> is a new girl in town. About 30 -LRB- she declines to state -RRB-, she has played a ghost in `` Beetlejuice,'' an insect's girlfriend in `` The Fly'' and a spaceling's lover in the forthcoming `` Earth Girls Are Easy. Her co-star in the latter two films was her husband, <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldblum </PERSON>. `` The Accidental Tourist'' is a more conventional role, though she is definitely offbeat as the free-thinker who comes to train <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurt </PERSON>'s dog and stays to form a romance. `` I read the -LRB- <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> -RRB- book when it first came out and I loved the character of <PERSON> Muriel </PERSON>,'' she says. `` It's kind of amazing that I got to work in the movie and people liked it and it's all worked out.'' <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> <PERSON> McDormand </PERSON>, 31, the least known of the supporting-actress nominees, is well respected among her fellow professionals. A graduate of the <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drama </ORGANIZATION>, she has won acclaim for stage portrayals, especially for her role as <PERSON> Stella </PERSON> in `` A Streetcar Named Desire,'' for which she won a recent <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> nomination. She appeared in two films by <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ethan </PERSON> <PERSON> Coen </PERSON>, `` Blood Simple'' and `` Raising <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>.'' In `` Mississippi Burning,'' <PERSON> McDormand </PERSON> plays the pivotal role of the wife of a deputy sheriff who is involved in the murder of three civil rights workers. In a recent magazine interview, she upheld the film against its detractors. `` A lot of things have n't changed that much since 1964. That's why I think the movie is so important I would consider the movie a failure if people came away from it saying, ` Oh, these things happened in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> in 1964. How terrible!' `` Instead, I hope they come out of it thinking these things happen all over the country, and they're still happening.'' <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cusack </PERSON> is best remembered as the frantic news producer in `` Broadcast News,'' and as a regular on `` <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s Saturday Night Live.'' She'll be seen next month in `` Say Anything'' as the sister of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cusack </PERSON>, her real-life brother. <PERSON> Cusack </PERSON>, 26, won her nomination as the wisecracking pal of <PERSON> Melanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON> in `` Working Girl.'' She recently talked about the difference between the two women: `` <PERSON> Melanie </PERSON> and I are best friends, but she wants to move up from being a secretary to being an executive, and it distresses me. I mean, we have a life together _ we ride the same ferry to work, we take our coffee break together, we lunch together. That's enough for me. I'm a basically happy person. But <PERSON> Melanie </PERSON> wants more.'' A former beauty pageant contestant in <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Pfeiffer </PERSON> languished in forgettable films -LRB- `` Grease 2,'' `` <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Chan </PERSON> and the Curse of the Dragon Queen'' -RRB- and what she calls `` junk television'' -LRB- `` <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>,'' `` B.A.D. Cats'' -RRB-. That changed when she scored as <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Pacino </PERSON>'s cool mistress in `` Scarface.'' After playing one of the title roles opposite <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicholson </PERSON> in `` The Witches of Eastwick,'' <PERSON> Pfeiffer </PERSON>, 31, became a hot ticket. Last year she appeared in three major films: `` Tequila Sunrise,'' `` Married to the Mob'' and `` Dangerous Liaisons.'' The latter brought her the nomination for supporting actress. It was no easy role. She played the almost saintly Madame de Tourvel who is cruelly seduced by a rakish nobleman -LRB- <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Malkovich </PERSON> -RRB- and then destroyed when he abandons her. The role required her to `` have about three nervous breakdowns,'' she says. The actress recalled sitting in with <PERSON> Malkovich </PERSON> in her dressing room and complaining, `` I ca n't do this. I ca n't do this again.'' Though she cried so much she came to work with her eyes swollen shut, she reverted to her native confidence `` that it was all there, and I would n't have any trouble.''

<TEXT>
 After years of TV addiction, Italians are finding their way out of the house and rediscovering the pleasures of theatergoing. Internationally known actors are turning down movie scripts in favor of the stage, and spectators are responding by forming ticket lines at dawn to get into the hottest shows. <PERSON> Marcello </PERSON> <PERSON> Mastroianni </PERSON> has tackled Russian drama. Swedish film star <PERSON> Ingrid </PERSON> <PERSON> Thulin </PERSON> _ the sensuous woman in <PERSON> Ingmar </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergman </PERSON>'s classic 1957 film `` Wild Strawberries'' _ plays a domineering mother in a tragedy by the Spanish playwright <PERSON> Federico </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorca </PERSON>. Actress <PERSON> Monica </PERSON> <PERSON> Vitti </PERSON> is being peppered with offers to bring her hilarious performance as a brash reporter in <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Hecht </PERSON>'s `` The Front Page'' back to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` After more than a decade-long love affair with television, Italians are once more thirsty for their roots of great comedy and tragedy,'' says <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rome </ORGANIZATION> sociology Professor <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Abruzzese </PERSON>. `` They want to be moved by real-life sounds and be tickled by the comedians they saw on the screen.'' Last year, movie attendance in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> dropped by 18 percent. While movie houses have been closing throughout the country, new theaters have opened in <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION> and smaller cities to bring the total to 1,700 nationwide. <PERSON> Thulin </PERSON>, one of <PERSON> Bergman </PERSON>'s favorite actresses, has returned to the stage after a 20-year absence in <PERSON> Lorca </PERSON>'s `` The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bernarda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alba </ORGANIZATION>'' which is presently on tour in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bergman </PERSON> himself will come to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> this year to direct an Italian version of <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>'s `` Long Day's Journey Into Night.'' <PERSON> Mastroianni </PERSON>'s performance in <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> Michailov </PERSON>'s `` Mechanical Pianola'' produced a nightly traffic jam in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>'s central <LOCATION> Piazza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>. They play is adapted from a short story by <PERSON> Chekhov </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mastroianni </PERSON> told interviewers he had n't felt so thrilled since he won an Oscar nomination for his role in `` Dark Eyes'' three years ago. Comedian <PERSON> Ugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Tognazzi </PERSON> riled a few government ministers and triggered controversy by improvising lines about corruption in high places during his stage version of <PERSON> Moliere </PERSON>'s classic `` The Miser.'' Italians spent $ 118 million on theater tickets in 1987 _ a 23 percent increase from 1986, and 1988 figures point to another 20 percent jump. During that period, the average price of an orchestra seat increased only about 16 percent, from $ 18 to $ 21. Government statistics show that one out of five Italians attended some sort of theater performance in 1988. Just as in Roman times the government organized theater events for its people, today's network of 14 state-subsidized theaters, offer stage variety that ranges from translations of <LOCATION> Broadway </LOCATION> hits to Greek tragedy to Italian classics. Post avant-garde performances and experimental groups at 500 private theaters and four drama schools also get a share of the $ 42 million which the Italian government annually allocates to encourage the theater industry. <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s ancient theater tradition has its roots in the classics of <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> theater _ tragedy, comedy and satire. In medieval times, religious themes were popular. During the Renaissance a new form based on classic theater was shaped by <PERSON> Machiavelli </PERSON> and others. It gave way to the commedia dell ` arte which dominated <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and most of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> until the end of the <PERSON> Luigi </PERSON> <PERSON> Pirandello </PERSON>, master of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s 20th-century theater, focused on the condition of the modern man. While the classics are still popular, they have competition from Broadway-style productions. <PERSON> Vitti </PERSON>, who starred in an all-woman version of <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s `` Odd Couple'' last year, has been touring <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> in `` Front Page.'' `` The success has been incredible,'' she said. `` Spectators have stood on line all night in <LOCATION> Turin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lucca </LOCATION>. Police have had to intervene to stop punchups over tickets, and we're still going strong after four months on tour.'' <PERSON> Vitti </PERSON> has received offers to bring the show to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION>, but her fear of flying makes her hesitate. A scuffle erupted New Year's Eve in <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION> over the presentation of `` Trojan Women'' in ancient Greek. Fifty spectators fought over the remaining four tickets on sale at a theater. Other serious dramas, including works by <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pirandello </PERSON>, are playing to sold-out crowds. <PERSON> Andrea </PERSON> <PERSON> Jonasson </PERSON>, the Swedish wife of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s best-known theater director <PERSON> Giorgio </PERSON> <PERSON> Strehler </PERSON>, alternated lines in Italian and German in <PERSON> Pirandello </PERSON>'s Berlin-based drama on lost identity, `` As You Desire Me.

 There are n't many bands who have made <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON> cry and <PERSON> Brigitte </PERSON> <PERSON> Bardot </PERSON> laugh. But then, they are n't many bands that sound like the <ORGANIZATION> Gipsy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kings </ORGANIZATION>. Their music is a fiery blend of flamenco, jazz and Latin sounds driven by a half-dozen guitars; their lyrics are sung in Gitane, a mixture of Spanish, French and Gypsy. It's not the usual Top 40 fare, yet the band from the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> _ international stars in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> _ has broken onto the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> charts with their catchy `` Bamboleo.'' `` It's funny to see in Billboard that we're in different categories each time,'' said <PERSON> Chico </PERSON> <PERSON> Bouchikhi </PERSON>, speaking through an interpreter. `` Nobody knows where to place us.'' The music is n't the only thing that's different about this band; the group's army of six guitar players are all related. Brothers <PERSON> Nicolas </PERSON> and <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Reyes </PERSON> are joined by their brother-in-law, <PERSON> Bouchikhi </PERSON>, and three cousins, <PERSON> Diego </PERSON>, <PERSON> Paco </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tonino </PERSON> <PERSON> Baliardo </PERSON>. `` A family is able to live, work, do music and have fun together. It's better to have it that way,'' said <PERSON> Bouchikhi </PERSON>, speaking just prior to the band's appearances this month on `` Saturday Night Live'' and `` The Tonight Show Starring <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Carson </PERSON>.'' The band has played together for the past 16 years, crossing barriers of language, music and geography as their career slowly progressed. They started out playing street corners and cafes for change, where they quickly attracted an impressive coterie of fans. One of their first boosters was the legendary comic <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON>. They met the Little Tramp while playing on the streets of <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> and he became their biggest fan, weeping as the Gypsies played their traditional songs. `` It was a very, very strong moment for the band, because he cried as he listened to the music,'' said <PERSON> Bouchikhi </PERSON>. `` It was very strong to realize that someone who had made the whole world laugh for so long could cry to our music.'' And what about <PERSON> Bardot </PERSON>? `` We met by chance about 10 years ago when we received an offer to play for one of her birthday parties,'' <PERSON> Bouchikhi </PERSON> said. `` It went really well, and everybody was dancing and happy. So we became friends. ... She was kind of a godmother for the group.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Gipsy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kings </ORGANIZATION> repaid her friendship by recording a song about <PERSON> Bardot </PERSON> titled -LRB- in English -RRB- `` Woman.'' Language has never been a problem for the group as they moved around the world. `` Bamboleo'' and its follow-up, `` Djobi, <LOCATION> Djoba </LOCATION>,'' were huge hits. `` Emotion and passion do not need language really, and that's the most important language really,'' <PERSON> Bouchikhi </PERSON> said. `` Words to us are not secondary, but not that important. It's a general feeling of the music.'' And despite the growing success, the band does n't want to become too successful. The idea of the <ORGANIZATION> Gipsy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kings </ORGANIZATION> headlining at Giants Stadium does n't hold much appeal for the group, <PERSON> Bouchikhi </PERSON> said. `` What's important is to keep the idea of a big party, some kind of joy and emotion,'' he said. `` And if you're playing to too many in a group, it's kind of difficult to keep the emotion together. `` You have to keep some kind of balance. It's pretty easy to lose yourself while going up and up and up.'' To prevent that, group members rejoin their friends and relatives each year in an 80-trailer caravan in <LOCATION> Arles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, for an annual Gypsy festival. It is a time for the band to renew its family ties and relax. `` We need to come back. It's very important to have the time to be together again before going out and traveling again,'' said <PERSON> Bouchikhi </PERSON>. `` So we try to spend a lot of time in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>.''

 `` These are the days of the anonymous nocturnal bullet, of the slashing of throats of village officials, of the disappearance of union leaders.'' So wrote <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilderbrandt </PERSON> in a column recently in Si magazine in a passage that epitomizes the desperation of today's <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, a nation struggling with economic chaos and a savage leftist insurgency that threatens to explode into civil war. From cab drivers to congressmen, Peruvians are asking themselves what went wrong in their Andean country, which had one of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s strongest economies until the 1960s. _ More than 14,000 people have been killed in the nine-year uprising by the the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Shining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Path </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- Sendero Luminoso -RRB- guerrilla organization Blackouts and bombs have become part of daily life in <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>. A paramilitary death squad has made its appearance. _ Inflation hit a record 1,722 percent in 1988 and is widely projected to soar above 10,000 percent this year, pushing wages and salaries down to bare-survival levels The economy shrank 9 percent in 1988 and is likely to contract even more this year. _ The collapse is putting hundreds of thousands of people out of work in the continent's third largest country and one of its poorest In 1976, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> produced 34,000 automobiles; this year it is expected to assemble, at the most, 3,500. Few people can afford them. Although many Peruvians blame President <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> for the chaos, most independent analysts say the economic crisis had been building toward an eruption for the past several decades; <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>'s populist, free-spending policies lit the fuse Highway bandits have begun waylaying buses and automobiles, making travel outside <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> dangerous and adding to the sense of a disintegrating nation where law and order has broken down. Many Peruvians now speak of `` the civil war that is coming,'' seeing it as inevitable. `` There is a very real danger that <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, without realizing it, is sinking deeper into the swamps of fratricidal war,'' the magazine <PERSON> Oiga </PERSON> commented in a recent editorial. Surveys indicate most people have little faith that solutions will be found. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, a dynamic young leader, was elected in 1985 as `` the president of hope.'' But his defiant stance against paying the foreign debt, now $ 19 billion, cut <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> off from international aid and his uncontrolled spending bankrupted the country, critics say. These days angry crowds shout `` <PERSON> Alan </PERSON>, you charlatan'' when he speeds by in heavily armed convoys. In recent months <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> has been hit by waves of coup rumors and many Peruvians doubt the presidential election scheduled for April 1990 will take place. Leftist military officers seized power in 1968; constitutional government was restored in 1980. Former Mayor <PERSON> Alfonso </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrantes </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, a Marxist, is one of the favorites in the campaign. The other front-runner is the writer <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON> <PERSON> Llosa </PERSON>, leader of a center-right coalition. Peruvians frequently mention the opening passage in <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON> <PERSON> Llosa </PERSON>'s 1974 novel `` Conversation in the Cathedral,'' saying it succinctly reflects their feelings now: `` From the doorway of <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cronica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> looks at the <LOCATION> Avenida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tacna </LOCATION> without love: cars, uneven and faded buildings, the gaudy skeletons of posters floating in the mist, the gray midday. At what precise moment had <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> -LRB- screwed -RRB- itself up?'' One who saw things that way was <PERSON> Morty </PERSON> <PERSON> Weisselberg </PERSON>, 41, a second-generation Peruvian, who had a high-paying job as the manager of a small metallurgical company. He packed up and left a few months ago for <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> with his wife and two small daughters. Before he left he explained why. `` What worries me is the kind of future I am going to leave my children. ` The future that this country offers is very different from the one 30 years ago when I was in the position of my children. Then there was a bright future for the country, at least apparently.'' The Weisselbergs were among 150,000 Peruvians, most of them professionals and skilled workers, who bought one-way tickets out the country in 1988, the largest exodus in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s history.

 Many blame <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s economic decline on several decades of government mismanagement, controls that have stifled private enterprise and strident nationalism that has frightened away foreign investors and isolated <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> from world financial centers. More than anything, <PERSON> Weisselberg </PERSON> said before he left, he was frightened by what he saw as the country's deep class divisions and its growing violence. Political analysts agree with him that <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s social and racial divisions, inherited from the Spanish colonial era, have spawned class hatred that threatens to rip apart the fabric of Peruvian society. The scorn and discrimination shown by <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s white elite toward the dark-skinned Indian and mestizo majority has generated deep resentment among <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s poor, say social scientists. `` Political violence in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> is not the result of poverty alone but of humiliation, oppression, class hatred, racism,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernales </PERSON>, head of a blue-ribbon <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel on violence. For many Peruvian and foreign political experts, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> now stands at a critical point in its 165-year history where an antiquated, inequitable and inefficient politial structure is crumbling. `` For me the Shining Path is nothing more than the violent natural expression of this social explosion,'' said <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Lumbreras </PERSON>, one of <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s most important archaeologists. `` If it had not been Shining Path, sooner or later there would have been another group,'' Lumbreras is from <LOCATION> Ayacucho </LOCATION>, the impoverished highland province where the Maoist-inspired guerrillas launched their insurgency in 1980, after 10 years of organizing among Quechua-speaking Indians in the countryside. <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> covers an area larger than <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> combined and has a population of 21 million. But just as it is divided by class and race, it is sharrply divided by its geography into three regions _ the Andean sierra, the coastal deserts and the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> rain forest _ that feel little in common with one another. In the 1950s highland peasants began to crowd into <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, the capital, looking for a better life, and the migration has accelerated in recent years as the countryside has turned into a battlefield. With the Shining Path insurgency and the forced integration of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> and other coastal cities, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s white class has begun to feel challenged for the first time. Once the royal capital of the Spanish empire in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> is surrounded by the bleakest shantytowns on the continent, home to two-thirds of the city's 7 million inhabitants. <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>'s rich, increasingly insecure, live behind high walls in suburbs to which entry is controlled by gates and armed guards. The economic collapse, regarded as the worst in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s history, has hit the middle class and the poor the hardest. The purchasing power of salaries has plummeted by at least 50 percent in the last year. A doctor at a public hospital earns the equivalent of $ 80 a month. A public school teacher earns $ 55. The value of an army general's salary has fallen from $ 1,100 a month in 1980 to $ 200 today. <PERSON> Dorotea </PERSON> <PERSON> Sandoval </PERSON> lives with her husband and eight children in the shantytown of <LOCATION> Villa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, where mothers boil fish bones to give a thin broth to their children. `` We stopped eating meat a long time ago,'' she said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> may be too good for the Pentagon. They're starting to make him sound like a saint. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmed <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> at top speed, unanimously, one week after President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> named him to be secretary of <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION>, a striking contrast to the 10-week struggle that led to the rejection of former Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> for the job. One Republican senator called the quick confirmation a rush to judgment, but voted for <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> anyhow. But then speed and harmony were understandable given the senators' appraisals of the six-term congressman from <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> was pronounced trustworthy, steady, realistic, pragmatic, remarkable, moral, unique, superb, experienced, tough, compassionate, outstanding academically, exemplary, committed, unflappable, smart, a man of integrity and the ultimate legislator. All of that in an hour's discussion, with no harsh words except for leftover complaints that Tower had been treated unfairly and was still being maligned by published accusations of excessive drinking. <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION>'s path to confirmation began with banter after weeks of gallows humor about dry happy hours. <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said he had enjoyed his one public appearance before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` It was a lot of fun,'' he said. None of it was fun for Tower, even before he was publicly accused of drinking too much and stepping out on his wives when he was married. From the outset, he had faced critical questions about the consulting fees he received from defense contractors after he left the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 1985, contractors he would have dealt with as secretary of defense. Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said there was nothing on the <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION> record to even hint at a conflict of interest or any other problem He insisted the committee had taken no shortcuts on the <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION> nomination, that `` this nominee is being treated like all others.'' But the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> obviously was in a hurry-up mood after the Tower rejection. Besides, the two-week Easter recess began on Friday, and the people who had rejected one nominee did n't want to leave on vacation without filling the job. It usually is easier the second time around. Senators who have voted against a presidential nominee do n't want to do it again. But it does n't always work that way _ <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> was defeated on successive nominations to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> would have been overwhelmingly confirmed in the first place. He does not pose as a defense expert, but he needs no pose. <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> knows government from the inside, as a White House aide and <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>'s chief of staff. He is a firmly conservative Republican, No. 2 in his party's <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> leadership, but he draws solid praise from Democrats as well as <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> colleagues. Tower's nomination was damaged by delay before it ever got to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. It took more than a month for the president to announce that he was choosing Tower, a delay the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> blamed on the need to check out accusations it said were proven groundless. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> heard similar accusations and decided otherwise. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, leading the debate against Tower, said even the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> transition team had internal differences on the nomination. There was no hesitation on the <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION> appointment _ <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made it one day after Tower was rejected. It was not set up in advance of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote, but Chief of Staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> had raised the possibility with <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> by seeking his counsel on candidates for the Pentagon. One public and one closed-door hearing later, the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> voted 20 to 0 for <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>, and a day after that he was confirmed. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> insisted the committee had checked <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> out carefully and thoroughly and had followed its standing procedures on nominees. That included an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> report; Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Va </LOCATION>., said more than 100 people were checked in that part of the process The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> report on Tower, concentrating on his drinking habits, became a central issue in that debate, even though it was secret. Senators could read it but could not cite or quote from it. That process was unique. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> read the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> report on <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION> and told other committee members they found nothing detrimental. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said that is standard and sufficient in most cases, although other committee members can arrange to see <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> reports if they deem it necessary. In this case, none did. `` Let's not make any mistake about it, this is a rush to judgment,'' insisted Sen. <PERSON> Arlen </PERSON> <PERSON> Specter </PERSON>, R-Pa. `` Let's not make it a precedent. He also observed that it is possible to rush to the right judgment.

<HEAD>Cultures Mingle in Arab Desert as American Indians Perform</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 War whoops pierced the desert stillness. Tom-toms kept the beat as dancers circled under the starry sky and the campfire flickered their shadows on the adobe walls. The American Indian had come to Arabia. The fascinated onlookers were Bahrainis, who also have tribal origins, but dance to different drums. The occasion was a cross-cultural pow-wow during a visit by the American Indian Dance Theatre, a 15-member troupe touring the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> under the auspices of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. The Americans, representing eight Indian tribes from Apache to Zuni, said they were delighted by the Arabs' enthusiasm at their performances, featuring traditional dances in authentic dress. `` We show them the vibrant colors, our beadwork, the songs, dances. In a sense, they're just like us, they have their tribal songs and dances that are new to us, just as ours are to them,'' said <PERSON> Marty </PERSON> <PERSON> Pennecoose </PERSON>, 31, a Southern Ute who now lives in <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, and works as a high-iron construction worker. The desert gathering, arranged by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, was a private affair held in the ruins of an 80-year-old sheik's palace, within sight and smell of <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>'s oil and gas fields. The 50 or so guests sat on rugs in the sand, eating <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> food, including four roast lambs, to watch an all-male Bahraini dance group perform. The Indians later staged an impromptu performance. Long hair and braids flew as the dancers, wearing jeans, cowboy boots and sneakers instead of tribal costumes, mingled with the Bahrainis in their white dishdashi robes and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> headdress. <PERSON> Pennecoose </PERSON> said it was `` a learning process, going to these different countries, experiencing their surroundings and cultures, things that we'd only see in books.'' `` We want to show the rest of the world what we have to offer,'' he said. `` It's a good thing, what we're doing, dancing around the world.'' <PERSON> Arlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Neskahi </PERSON>, 32, a Navajo and lead singer, said he found cultural similarities as well as differences. `` Our people are shepherds, and I grew up eating lamb and goat,'' said <PERSON> Neskahi </PERSON>, who wore an Arab head scarf wrapped in the style of <LOCATION> Yemen </LOCATION>, one of the group's earlier stops. `` My father always told me it takes all the colors of the rainbow to make it beautiful,'' he said. `` We want to share our cultures with other people who do n't know anything about us,'' said <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahooty </PERSON>, 60, a Zuni Indian from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and the troupe's senior member. `` The people here think that <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> is the most popular, not the Indians. We have to tell them the truth.'' It was that stereotype that the company's founder and producer, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwei </PERSON>, said she wanted to dispel. `` I felt there was definitely a need to express the American Indian culture to people because there is such a lack of information. I thought it was time for a company done properly, playing first-class theaters all over the world.'' <PERSON> Schwei </PERSON>, with director and choreographer <PERSON> Hanay </PERSON> <PERSON> Geiogamah </PERSON>, picked the dancers during visits to Indian pow-wows and festivals in the southern and northwestern <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The members are drawn from both American and Canadian tribes. <PERSON> Geiogamah </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Kiowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, said the result is `` a kind of new pan-tribal idiom'' that helps Indians preserve and expand an important art form. <PERSON> Mahooty </PERSON>, who adorns himself with huge turquoise breastplates and rings, said American Indian dances emphasize a religious relationship with nature. Many are acted-out prayers to the `` Great Creator,'' mother <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, or mountain spirits, for rain, good harvest or hunting. `` Eagle dances,'' common from the northern plains to the southwestern pueblos, pay homage to the soaring bird that Indians believe has direct contact with deities in the sky. For one Bahraini it was a new look at a people `` we know only from cowboy films.''

 Two-year-old Margaux, <PERSON> Lorraine </PERSON> and <PERSON> Claire </PERSON> are busy bathing their dolls. <PERSON> Zoe </PERSON> is sponge-painting. Three other toddlers paste spots inside a drawing of a big blue fish. In the next room excited 15-month-olds throw rubber balls into a plastic swimming pool and then jump in. In <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, where women make up 42 percent of the work force, collective infant care subsidized by federal and local funds is a way of life for nearly 335,000 children, rich and poor, under the age of 3. To get a first-hand look at <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s much-admired system, 14 U.S. child-care experts recently spent two weeks touring nearly two dozen day care centers, pre-schools and drop-in centers in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and the provinces. They met with French child care professionals and government officials, looking for ways to improve child care services in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` In the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, we're still light years away from what we've seen here,'' said <PERSON> Evelyn </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Child </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insitutute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, who took part in the visit sponsored by the Frenc receive special training including nursing skills. Day care center directors are registered nurses who have had additional training plus five years of day care experience. The law requires one aide for every five infants who do not walk, and one aide for every eight who do walk. Each center has its own pediatrician, child psychologist and dietician who make two visits weekly, along with a full-time laundress, cook and cleaning personnel. `` In the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> we basically have untrained people working in child care. In <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, child care is considered a profession and has status,'' said <PERSON> Susanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, legislative counsel to Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif. Mrs. <PERSON> Revel </PERSON> said the locale _ a cheerful, brand-new facility designed to handle young children _ was another reason she opted for day care `` It's very safe. The children are n't being told constantly not to do this or that. Their only restraints are with regard to each other.'' Health and safety regulations are a major concern for child care advocates in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. While many mothers say children in day care are sick more frequently than children kept at home, child care professionals disagree. <PERSON> Bettye </PERSON> <PERSON> Caldwell </PERSON>, professor of early childhood education at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arkansas </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>, says statistics show that infants under 12 months in day care get 10 colds a year as opposed to 8 colds for children who stay home. `` Out of 66 children here, there are always about a dozen who are sick, and they're always the same ones,'' said <PERSON> Nada </PERSON> <PERSON> Finztler </PERSON>, the director of a day care center in central <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. American experts are also examining French day care funding. Parents pay the equivalent of $ 1.50 to $ 18.00 a day, on a sliding scale linked to their income. Officials say the overall costs for a single day of child care in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> is about $ 33 and up to $ 50 in the provinces. Parent fees cover roughly 30 percent of operating costs. National and municipal government funds make up the difference. `` I'm especially impressed by <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s commitment to child care from the national level down to the municipal level, and the integration of support from each level,'' Ms. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said. French municipalities pay for building child care facilities and provide equipment. The Education Ministry oversees pre-school teacher training and the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> handles child care aids. Several experts said they were surprised by the French system's near universal availability `` What strikes me is that programs in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> are for all kinds of families, whereas in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the care would be directed towards low-income and disadvantaged families,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Edie </PERSON>, a day care specialist at the <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. He said the proposed Act for Better Child Care, known as the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> bill in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, targets only low-income families. It would earmark $ 2.5 billion to provide more child care facilities, upgrade training for child care workers, subsidize the care costs for low-income families and create resource and referral services. <PERSON> Edie </PERSON> called the bill `` a drop in the bucket'' and said it would not affect middle-class double-income families who would still have to scramble for costly private care. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s child care system is an extension of family policies adopted decades ago to counter a falling birthrate and population devastation wrought by war. <PERSON> Edie </PERSON> says the French have understood better than most that child care is not just a baby-sitting service, but an educational experience. `` We can learn a lot from the French,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>. `` It's clear their government has made a firm commitment to young children and families We're just not there yet, but child care is a service whose time has come.'' At Mrs. <PERSON> Finztler </PERSON>'s day care center in <LOCATION> Les </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Halles </LOCATION>, nearly 100 children from 2 months to 3 years of age are engaged in different activities. The 2-year-olds bang on drums and blow into recorders. Afterwards, they lie on the floor breathing deeply to relax. `` We focus on introducing new physical sensations and experiences,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Fintzler </PERSON> said. Earlier, the toddlers took off their clothes and slid around in soft white flour, `` learning about softness and slipperiness.'' The tots also love splashing finger paint all over each others' naked bodies, learning about `` sexual difference'' and losing `` inhibitions about what's clean or dirty,'' she said

 With his bolo ties and legs bowed by knee troubles, <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawley </PERSON> has the look of an aging cowboy bent on kicking up one more ruckus. That's precisely what the 64-year-old retired pilot has in mind. <PERSON> Hawley </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Marsha </PERSON>, 51, have launched a mom-and-pop petition drive aimed at a decision by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to fund a new catastrophic health insurance program for old people by taxing elderly retirees. The petition drive has attracted 140,000 signatures from people irate about the new <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> law, which will tack $ 800 or more onto the annual tax bills of <PERSON> Hawley </PERSON> and other affluent retirees. It's a grass-roots rebellion, fed by retirees' fears that if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> can put a special tax bite on them to pay for these benefits, the lawmakers will do it again and again. The outcries have caught lawmakers by surprise. They were trying to patch some of the cracks in Medicare that had spurred sales of high-cost, low-benefit `` Medigap'' insurance policies. They also wanted to free the aged of the worry of being bankrupted by catastrophic medical bills without adding to the deficit or raising taxes. When then-President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> signed the legislation last July 1, he noted with pride that it `` follows the same premise as all sound insurance programs: It will be paid for by those who are covered by its services.'' `` That's a change in attitude in this country,'' boasted Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. The new law divides the $ 33 billion, five-year cost of benefits among the 33 million Medicare beneficiaries _ not equally, but according to ability to pay. All but the poorest pay a $ 4-a-month premium that generates 37 percent of the money needed. The other 63 percent of the costs are picked up by a `` supplemental premium,'' or surtax, on the 40 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> beneficiaries with enough income to owe at least $ 150 in federal income taxes. What seemed like fiscal prudence to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> smacked of tax tyranny to <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawley </PERSON> and his loosely knit band of confederates. He claims the new Medicare benefits are minuscule and the costs are steep, and he inveighs bitterly against the `` dictators'' who railroaded `` this big caboozle'' through <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` The senior citizens of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> are in the greatest fight they have been in since World War II, and this time it is with their own <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' said the white-haired <PERSON> Hawley </PERSON>, a one-time pile driver from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> who boasts that he `` never bent any tin'' during nearly 34 years as an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> pilot. `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> did a marvelous job of keeping the public uninformed on the total extent of this bill. The seniors are saying, ` We did not ask for this bill. Take your benefit back. Leave us alone.''' Each morning's mail brings another stack of letters, petitions and a few small checks for <PERSON> Hawley </PERSON>'s cause. `` In <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> we are all hopping mad. Who was on the committee that passed this abomination?'' wrote a <LOCATION> Punta </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gorda </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, man. A <LOCATION> Pottstown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, retiree sent <PERSON> Hawley </PERSON> a copy of the note he now sends charities informing them that until the new Medicare act is repealed, `` all of our funds previously available for good causes such as yours have been confiscated by the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. government.'' A <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, man complained that senior citizens are being `` forced to pay for the health care of profligate drug users and AIDS victims who for any reason have gained a place on the rolls of Medicare and Medicaid.'' `` If, indeed, this concept is the trend of the future, i.e., ` Make those who benefit, pay,' then please hasten to take us from the list of those who pay for child care, education, welfare, <ORGANIZATION> ADC </ORGANIZATION>, low-income housing and a myriad of other government giveaway programs from which we receive no direct benefit,'' wrote the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> retiree. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and some of the other `` dictators'' at whom this torrent of complaints is aimed defend their legislation and argue that many of the critics are misinformed. Medicare remains `` the best buy in town'' for its rly or disabled beneficiaries, including the 1.6 million seniors who will be hit with the maximum tax, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> insists. `` I hear some of these folks say, ` Well, the odds are that they're not going to need catastrophic illness -LRB- covera33 million eldege -RRB-.' Well, that's wonderful,'' said <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. `` Well, there's only one-half a percent chance that your home's going to burn down but to be prudent most of us go out and buy fire insurance on our homes, and if we do n't go out and voluntarily do it, the people that carry the mortgage insist that we do it And we're delighted that we do n't have to collect on it,'' he said. `` The same thing is true in catastrophic. You would hope you never had to collect on it. But The Hawleys began their organization last summer after reading a senior columnist's article in the Las Vegas Review-Journal and calling a meeting at a local senior citizens' center. Some were <ORGANIZATION> AARP </ORGANIZATION> members dissatisfied with their own organization's stance <ORGANIZATION> AARP </ORGANIZATION> says it likes the catastrophic benefits, but not the way they were financed. The organization has held its ground, despite pressure from some chapters. <PERSON> Hawley </PERSON> has debated a top <ORGANIZATION> AARP </ORGANIZATION> executive on public television's MacNeil-Lehrer News Hour, and squared off with <ORGANIZATION> AARP </ORGANIZATION> officials on other television and radio shows He is n't camera-shy. `` We are constantly talking over microphones in an airplane,'' he explained. While <PERSON> Hawley </PERSON> speaks of waging a David vs. Goliath struggle against the <ORGANIZATION> AARP </ORGANIZATION> to lobby for repeal of the catastrophic act, he disavows any intention of trying to turn his coalition into a permanent lobbying force. Others are using the fight over catastrophic coverage to try to sign seniors up for new organizations, and banks and securities firms are using it to pitch tax-free investments. <PERSON> Hawley </PERSON>'s petition warns that the elderly could wind up footing the bill for `` most of the medical costs of AIDS patients.'' With the AIDS medication AZT costing up to $ 10,000 a year per patient, <PERSON> Hawley </PERSON> fears that elderly people with big drug bills could get frozen out of the program. The prescription drug benefit has a cap so that only those with the steepest drug bills are helped. Some 5.5 million beneficiaries _ one in six _ will get <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> reimbursement for some of their drug costs. But relatively few AIDS patients live long enough to get Medicare. Some 10,000 AIDS patients receive Social Security disability payments, but only 900 have been on the disability rolls for the two years required to qualify for <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION>, according to <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gambino </PERSON>. Despite its name, the Catastrophic Coverage Act makes only a small dent in the financial problems confronting families trying to pay for long-term nursing home care, which costs an average of $ 25,000 a year. The new Medicare law relaxes restrictions on the income and assets an elderly person can own when a spouse needs Medicaid to help pay nursing home bills. The uproar may make lawmakers leery of ever attempting to cover long-term care costs under <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Horace </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Deets </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> AARP </ORGANIZATION>'s executive director, said the complaints about the Medicare catastrophic act are a `` good example of what happens when you take a patchwork approach to a systemic problem. We need something done for universal access to comprehensive care, and it is n't here yet for everybody.'' In addition to repealing the catastrophic act, <PERSON> Hawley </PERSON> also wants <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to set up a blue-ribbon presidential commission to examine the `` monstrous'' unresolved health care issues. He would set one rule for this commission: no politicians allowed. <PERSON> Hawley </PERSON> is n't saying when he will deliver his petitions to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> did n't tell the Germans when he was going to land,'' the pilot said. `` When the snowball is rolling down the mountain, you do n't stop it halfway.'' If he loses the fight, `` then I almost guarantee you that in two years, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has its greatest turnover ever. The senior power will vote them out of office.'' If he wins, `` then you will never hear <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawley </PERSON>'s name again. He's going down and start playing golf, all across this country.''

<TEXT>
 Here is a look at the new or expanded benefits provided the elderly and disabled by the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act, and how much beneficiaries will have to pay for them. HOSPITAL _ <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> beneficiaries will pay a deductible of $ 564 for their first day's stay in the hospital each year, but <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> pays the rest of their hospital bills, no matter how long the stay. Previously there were limits on how much Medicare would pay for stays longer than 60 days, and patients were charged a deductible for each hospital admission after a 60-day `` spell of illness.'' Effective: Jan. 1, 1989. DOCTOR BILLS _ Starting in 1990, <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> beneficiaries will have to pay no more than $ 1,370 in out-of-pocket expenses for doctor bills and other services under <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION>'s Part B. However, if their physician charges more than <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> approves, they will still be liable for the difference. <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> patients must pay the first $ 75 as a deductible on approved charges, then <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> will pay 80 percent of other approved charges up to the $ 1,370 threshold, and 100 percent beyond it. If a patient's private insurance pays some of the bills, that still counts toward the $ 1,370. Effective: Jan. 1, 1990. DRUGS _ Currently, <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> pays only for prescription drugs administered in the hospital and for immunosuppressive drugs administered during the first year after an organ transplant. Starting in 1990, it will begin covering outpatient prescription drugs for the first time. In 1990 <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> will help pay for certain antibiotics and other intravenous drugs, and it will cover immunosuppressive drugs beyond the first year of a transplant. After a $ 550 deductible, <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> will pay 80 percent of the cost of intravenous drugs and 50 percent for the immunosuppressives. In 1991, <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> will begin covering most other prescription drugs and insulin. There will be a $ 600 deductible and 50 percent co-payment for 1991; a $ 652 deductible and 40 percent co-payment for 1992, and a 20 percent co-payment and deductible to be determined for 1993 and beyond. SKILLED NURSING FACILITY _ <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> will pay for 150 days of skilled nursing care, up from 100 days. The co-payment is limited to an estimated $ 22 per day for the first eight days. The new law scraps a requirement that a patient had to be hospitalized for at least three days before entering a skilled nursing facility. Effective: Jan. 1, 1989. HOME HEALTH CARE _ For those who meet <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION>'s restrictive eligibility requirements, the catastrophic act will provide up to 38 consecutive days of care. Those who do not need daily care will be eligible for up to six days a week for as long as prescribed by a doctor. Effective: Jan. 1, 1990. HOSPICE CARE _ The new law provides unlimited hospice care for terminal patients; it was previously limited to 210 days. Effective: Jan. 1, 1989. RESPITE CARE _ For someone caring at home for a <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> beneficiary requiring daily personal care, <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> will pay for up to 80 hours per year of home health aide and personal care services. Limited to those who have met either the annual deductible for prescription drugs or the $ 1,370 Part B catastrophic limit. Effective: Jan. 1, 1990. MAMMOGRAPHY: <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> will pay up to $ 50 for X-ray screenings to detect breast cancer. Effective: Jan. 1, 1990. TAXES AND PREMIUMS _ All <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Part </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> B </ORGANIZATION> beneficiaries now must pay an extra $ 4 premium each month; this will rise to $ 10.20 per month in 1993. Those who owe at least $ 150 in federal income taxes will also pay a supplemental premium based on that income tax liability. The supplemental premium rate for 1989 is $ 22.50 for each $ 150 of federal income taxes, or 15 percent. If someone owes $ 1,000 in federal taxes, they will have to pay an extra $ 150 in Medicare supplemental premium. The maximum supplemental premium is $ 800 per Medicare beneficiary, or $ 1,600 per couple enrolled in <LOCATION> Medicare </LOCATION>. The supplemental premium, or surcharge, rises from 15 percent for 1989 to 25 percent for 1990, 26 percent for 1991, 27 percent for 1992 and 28 percent for 1993. In effect, a 15 percent surcharge on the elderly boosts their 15 percent marginal tax rate to 17.25 percent and the 28 percent rate to 32.2 percent. In 1993, the 28 percent surcharge will boost the 15 percent rate to 19.2 percent and the 28 percent rate to 35.8 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> says 60 percent of the elderly will not be subject to the supplemental premium, paying only the $ 4-a-month premium for their coverage. It predicts that 5 percent of the elderly in 1989 and 10 percent in 1993 will pay the maximum supplemental premium. They are generally individuals with adjusted gross incomes above $ 43,000 this year and couples with incomes above $ 85,000. The committee says more than 7.8 million Medicare beneficiares, or 22 percent, will receive new benefits each year when the catastrophic act is fully implemented. Some 5.8 million will receive prescription drug benefits, 2.4 million will have doctor bills and other charges in excess of the $ 1,370 cap paid, and 1.5 million will be spared having to pay more than one hospital deductible of $ 564 each year. Although the new law does not provide direct coverage of long-term care costs, it eases Medicaid restrictions on how much income and assets an elderly spouse can keep when the other spouse is a Medicaid-financed nursing home resident. Effective Sept. 30, 1989, spouses will be able to keep income of at least 122 percent of the federal poverty level, or $ 786 per month. These limits will rise to 133 percent of the poverty line on July 1, 1991, and 150 percent on July 1, 1992. In addition, the new law allows states to permit the spouse to keep assets, in addition to a home, worth at least $ 12,000 and possibly as high as $ 60,000.

 A boy walking by Radio City Music Hall saw a big picture of <PERSON> Ella </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON>, advertising her upcoming concert. `` Ah, <PERSON> Ella </PERSON>!'' he cried, then he threw his arms wide and embraced the glass over the poster. You can show her picture or say `` Ella'' any place in the world and people know who you mean: <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s first lady of song. The 6,000-seat Music Hall sold out fast. After more than 50 years in show business, <ORGANIZATION> Miss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fitzgerald </ORGANIZATION> has n't tired of those appearances. These days, her doctor sanctions a couple of dates a month. The longest she's been away from the public was nine months, after her 1986 heart attack and a bypass operation. `` I love to sing and I love people,'' she says. `` I try to give people love through singing and make them happy.'' It was <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> men and their dates at a dance 54 years ago who put <PERSON> Ella </PERSON> in show business. From the stage, in the shy, modest tone of somebody unaware of her own greatness, she always thanks the public for keeping her there. When she arrived in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> from singing in <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> two days before her Radio City concert, a wealthy fan gave her a party. `` He had a cake made with my picture on it. <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Sedaka </PERSON> was there, <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendricks </PERSON>. We got up and jammed; we were supposed to be doing ` Lady Be Good.' You never heard such a ` Lady Be Good.''' <PERSON> Liza </PERSON> <PERSON> Minnelli </PERSON> and <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> <PERSON> Houston </PERSON>, who were unable to attend, sent notes of regret, which Miss <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> took home to keep. She travels with an 8-by-10 photograph of her 3-year-old granddaughter, <PERSON> Alice </PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. `` She likes country and western. She sings, ` You are my sunshine, my only sunshine.''' <PERSON> Alice </PERSON>'s singing is imitated by her famous grandmother. Imitating is one of the things Miss <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> does best. In <LOCATION> Radio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, she sings `` Ghost of a Chance'' like she thinks it would be done by a tenor saxophone, trades scat phrases with bassist <PERSON> Keeter </PERSON> <PERSON> Betts </PERSON> and offers a Louis Armstrong-like growl in her flag-waving final encore, `` Mack the Knife.'' In a voice that is light, girlish and true, she slips easily in and out of jazz, always swinging. When <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Granz </PERSON> became her manager in 1954, he bought her contract from <ORGANIZATION> Decca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION> and began recording her on his own new label, Verve. Instead of easing her slowly from jazz into the day's pop hits, he boldly moved her into classy popular music. Her first Verve recording was `` The Cole Porter Songbook.'' She'd been traveling with <PERSON> Dizzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON> and was apprehensive about drastically changing styles. `` I'd been singing be-bop. I thought the man was trying to get me out of the business.'' Instead, `` The Cole Porter Songbook'' introduced the singer to a larger, non-jazz audience. The record was followed by other `` songbooks'' devoted to the music of <PERSON> Gershwin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ellington </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rodgers </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arlen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kern </PERSON> and others. These days, Miss <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> sweetly reminds audiences, `` They're available on CD.'' If there was anybody left who did n't know <PERSON> Ella </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON>, they met her through commercials. She sang for Memorex tapes and a glass shattered. `` Kids liked it. They'd always ask me when I'm going to break another glass. We get on an airplane and pilots say, ` Whatever you do, do n't sing next to the window.''' Slimmed down from her previous look as a comfortably plump grandmother, she posed for <PERSON> Annie </PERSON> <PERSON> Leibovitz </PERSON> for an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> ad. The photographer chose a red dress, hat and leopard coat from Miss <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON>'s closet, posed her by her old convertible that had to be pushed into place and said something a bit raunchy _ Miss <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> does n't say what _ to put a `` foxy lady'' look on her face. `` She got me snazzy,'' the singer smiles. `` People take that picture out of magazines and ask me to autograph them.'' They also recognize her voice singing `` Is n't It Romantic'' in <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> TV ads as a couple loses a credit card in <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION> and picks up a replacement in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Ella </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION> <LOCATION> News </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, and moved to <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, before she started school. `` I came with my mother; she was married,'' Miss <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> says. `` I started first grade in <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION>, on <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> Street.'' Then in 1934 came the famous amateur contest _ famous because it's where Miss <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> was discovered _ in <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION>. `` I went as a dancer. I lost my nerve,'' she recalls. `` They had two sisters who closed the show, the Edwards Sisters. They could dance. I was the first amateur out. There was no way in the world I was going to go out there and try to dance after they had finished. `` Somebody laughed in the audience. The master of ceremonies said, ` Well, do something.' My mother had a record by <PERSON> Connee </PERSON> <PERSON> Boswell </PERSON>; she loved that record. She would play it so much that I got to know it. I tried to sing ` The Object of My Affection' and ` <PERSON> Judy </PERSON>.''' She won first prize. <PERSON> Bardu </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON>, who often fronted the <ORGANIZATION> Chick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Webb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Band </ORGANIZATION> on stage while <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> played drums, was there. He recommended the teen-ager to <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> as band vocalist and <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> said she could sing when he played a <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> dance. If she went over, she could join the band. She went over. In 1938, <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Webb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Band </ORGANIZATION> arranger <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> wrote `` A-Tisket, A-Tasket -LRB- I lost my yellow basket -RRB-,'' which became her first hit record. On her last birthday, when she turned 70, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Cosby </PERSON> sent her a huge basket of flowers and a note, `` A-tisket, a-tasket, I found your blank-blank basket.'' She has three bits of advice that she lives by. `` One time in a school play, I tried to sing ` Sing, You Sinners' and I got on the street and somebody told me they liked it and I ignored them. My mother slapped me down. You've heard of seeing stars? I saw stars. She told me, ` If somebody speaks to you, you say hello.''' Once, when she was pining, <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> says, `` <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellington </PERSON> told me it's like a toothache. It'll hurt for awhile. But when you take that tooth out, you miss it but you'll feel better.'' And a cousin told her to smile, even if people said something bad about her. `` I used to be very self-conscious. Somebody looked at me. I thought, ` Oh, what are they saying?' I learned to smile. It's beautiful to feel you can smile and you can love people. In 1987, after she recovered from her heart attack, she played the <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bowl </LOCATION>. Other dates were lined up but another, shorter layoff intervened. `` One of my toes had to be amputated. I was wearing pointy-toed evening shoes. Now I have to wear open-toed shoes. I say, ` Thank God, here I am walking.''' Last summer Miss <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> fell on a step on the Hollywood Bowl stage. Forget malpractice suits. The backstage was instantly full of doctors eager to help. The singer took a short intermission, then returned to sing `` Since I Fell for You.'' Now she enters and leaves the stage holding her pianist's arm. Her last recording, `` Easy Living,'' made with guitarist <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Pass </PERSON>, came out before her heart attack. The month she turned 70, a 30-year-old record, `` <PERSON> Ella </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> _ the Birthday Concert,'' was released for the first time. It was taken from a recently found tape of a concert she did in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> on her 40th birthday. She'll record again this spring and would like to make her first music video, in which she would dance, possibly with children from a Watts nursery that's named for her, then break into song. `` I love ballads because they tell a story,'' Miss <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> says. `` If it's a pretty tune, people start thinking about something that happened in their lives.'' She told her <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> audience, `` There will be something for everybody. The only thing I do n't have is rap. I might try it.'' As well as ballads and jazz, she included a bossa nova, had a rock beat behind `` Ai n't Nobody's Business,'' sang a <ORGANIZATION> Stevie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wonder </ORGANIZATION> song _ and did a gentle rap. Do n't be surprised if she tries a country-western duet someday with granddaughter <PERSON> Alice </PERSON>.

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ Some years ago public outrage threatened to end a booming industry, that of the Tennessee Walking Horse. The industry, and the breed, survive. One reason is because of people like <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>By JULES LOH</NOTE>

 It would be nice if everybody could claim the title his government has bestowed upon <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, but few measure up. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> is, officially, a Designated Qualified Person. `` I do n't know who thought up that name,'' says <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>. `` I guess they had to call us something.'' What <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> and only about 75 others are designated to be qualified at is deciding whether a horse, specifically a Tennessee Walking Horse, is fit to compete in a horse show. `` For a while there,'' he was saying the other day, stroking the forehead of a brood mare who ambled over to the fence to greet him, `` it looked like the whole walking horse business was going down the drain. That would have been a shame. It's a beautiful breed.'' It is most gentle with an easy gait that does n't jar the rider at any speed. It reaches its front feet high and far out, one and then the other, and brings its back feet forward to overstride the front. Its back remains as level as a love seat. The high stretch of the front feet is what horsemen call `` the big lick,'' a crowd-pleasing action prized in show rings. `` The gait is bred into the horse,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> explains. `` With regular training a good horse will develop the big lick naturally. But some trainers were n't satisfied. They took shortcuts, tried to make something artificial out of what's supposed to be natural. `` That's why we now have DQPs _ designated qualified persons.'' The `` shortcuts'' brought down upon the walking horse industry the wrath of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Horse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protective </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and other humane groups and, finally, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. In 1970 it passed the Horse Protection Act, aimed specifically at Tennessee Walking Horses, and assigned the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> to enforce its provisions. `` What the trainers would do,'' says <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, grimacing, `` was sore the horse. `` First they built up the front feet by putting thick pads between the hoof and the shoe. This raised the horse in front and gave him a longer reach, a higher step. Then they did the worst part. They burned the horse with a chemical, blistering it above the front hooves, and attached a heavy, rough chain that would rub on the sore part. `` The horse would try to kick the chains off, like you would try to throw a bracelet off your wrist that bothered you. The whole effect was to exaggerate the big lick. `` The crowds loved it. It really is exciting to watch. The judges listened to the crowds, and soon soring, as it was called, became the accepted way to treat a walking horse. `` I've seen horses so sore they could n't finish, just give out. I've seen horses walk off with blood running from above their hooves.'' The memory causes <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> to shudder. He can not abide cruelty. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> is 50. He is a gentle soul with a voice like a Southern lullaby. He and his wife, <PERSON> Christine </PERSON>, and their three children live in a friendly farmhouse a century old, nestled against a clear spring on 96 acres of <LOCATION> Cumberland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> foothills in this rural community near <LOCATION> Lynchburg </LOCATION>. Both <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> and <PERSON> Christine </PERSON> work at the nearby <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON>'s distillery, he in the steam plant, she in the bottling house `` Walking horses are important to me,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> says, `` but just as a sideline. Of course for a lot of folks around here their living is the walking horse business.'' Quite a business. <LOCATION> Shelbyville </LOCATION>, a few miles north of here, bills itself as `` The Walking Horse Capital of the World'' and is the site of an annual 10-day show, called The Celebration. It is to walking horses what the <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Derby </LOCATION> is to thoroughbreds. Last year's 50th annual Celebration drew more than 3,500 horses who competed before a paid attendance of 231,000 devotees of the big lick. `` It's like a 10-day carnival,'' says <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>. `` The fans get really into it. One time I had to disqualify the favorite and I thought it might cause a riot. They were n't pleased.'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> has been a DQP for six years and an inspector at the Celebration the past five. He recalls that when he first became an inspector he disqualified a horse at a small show and the trainer threatened him. `` That has n't happened since and I do n't believe it will ever happen again. The inspection program is accepted now, and I'm accepted as a fair person So are the other DQPs. `` The owners and trainers realize it's in their best interest. We reject fewer horses each year.'' At last year's Celebration, for example, 56 horses were rejected compared with 185 the year before. `` Why did I apply to become a DQP? Well, I grew up around walking horses and love the breed. I never could abide that business of soring them. `` In the old days they were called plantation horses, just a good sturdy horse you could ride all day without getting tired. People around here would ride them to a show on Sunday and ride them home. `` It was n't until they became big business, sort of show business, that trainers began soring them. There's big money in it. `` So when I heard about the DQP program I decided I would like to be one, like to help get the breed back to what it's supposed to be. `` Every Friday and Saturday night from the first of May through the end of October,'' says <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, `` there will be a horse show at one place or another, sometimes just small places around here like <LOCATION> Wartrace </LOCATION> and Belt Buckle and <PERSON> Winchester </PERSON>, and I will be at one of them. `` I will also go to auction sales and inspect there, so the buyers can be sure they are n't getting a horse that's been sored. `` The way I do it, I take up each front foot in turn. I press all around the top of the hoof, at one o'clock, two o'clock, all the way around. `` I press with my thumb until my nail turns a little white, that much pressure. If the horse flinches at all, just moves a little, that's it. I turn him down.'' Has it made the shows less sensational, less spectacular with those high-prancing steeds? `` No,'' says <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> emphatically. `` Now they have to produce that action by breeding it into the horse, not by abusing them. Knowing that, I believe the fans feel the shows are better than ever.'' What Designated Qualified Person would disagree?

 The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> is legendary for producing such all-American war heroes as <PERSON> Ulysses </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>, <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> MacArthur </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON>. But the `` country'' in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>'s motto `` Duty, Honor, Country'' does not necessarily mean the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. For the past century, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> has also been a training ground for future generals of foreign armies _ dictatorships as well as democracies. Soldiers like Filipino General <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON>, the late Nicaraguan dictator <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON> and pre-revolutionary <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> Gen. <PERSON> Ying </PERSON> <PERSON> Hsing </PERSON> <PERSON> Wen </PERSON> marched out of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>'s storied Long Gray Line to play key historical roles. This year's foreign plebes come from <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Liberia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>. Currently, 30 foreign cadets are training at <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cameroon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Liberia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION> among other places. Once approved by the secretary of <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION>, a nation's politics or relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are not considered in judging an applicant's merits, says Capt. <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrington </PERSON>, admissions officer for foreign cadets. `` We do not deal with philosophy,'' <PERSON> Carrington </PERSON> says. `` We try to keep standards for foreign cadets exactly the same as <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. citizens.'' There are cadets from countries ruled by hard-line dictators who do not tolerate dissent or hold elections, as well as from countries with democratic governments like that of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The purpose of educating foreign cadets at <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>, according to a <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> report, is to build good will and expose future foreign military leaders to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> ideals, especially in developing nations where the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> seeks to promote stability. <LOCATION> Annapolis </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> have similar programs. By law, each military academy is allowed 40 foreign cadets at a time. At the moment, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> has 37 and the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> academy, 32. `` Our goal is to provide an opportunity for students from selected countries to attend the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> and learn more about the way we do business in this country and go back home with a first-rate military education and hopefully be better allies,'' says Lt. Col. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Swiney </PERSON>, associate director of admissions at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> graduated from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> with honors in 1950. Thirty-six years later, he played a pivotal role in the revolt that ended <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' 20-year reign in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and put <PERSON> Corey </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> in power. <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> developed friendships with <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> classmates who went on to powerful posts in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military, including <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> chief of staff, and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wickham </PERSON>, who became the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s chief of staff. <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> is now <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary and one of his country's most popular figures. A veteran of the Korean and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> wars, <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> is using his education to fight a communist insurgency and quell coups in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Natee </PERSON> <PERSON> Wongissares </PERSON>, a senior from <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, agrees that both countries have benefited from <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>'s cadets at <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>. `` In the future these people -LRB- <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> graduates -RRB- have a tendency toward the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' the Thai cadet says. `` They can affect the relationship between the two countries for a better relationship, they will work together.'' Unstable political climates in some Third World countries, where change is more apt to take the form of a coup than a democratic vote, have created unusual situations for West Point graduates. Capt. <PERSON> Moises </PERSON> <PERSON> Cortizo </PERSON>, Class of 1980, is a loyal aide to Panamanian strongman <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, at odds with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since his indictment by an American grand jury on drug trafficking charges last year. <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ernesto </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>, Class of 1973, sought political asylum in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> after testifying before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> about his activities as a leader of a Salvadoran death squad. <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Debayle </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON>, son of the original Nicaraguan dictator <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON>, was given command of the Nicaraguan national guard when he graduated from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> in 1946. He went on to succeed his father as president before the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolution </ORGANIZATION> ended that regime. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>'s first foreign cadets came from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, but the program has expanded virtually worldwide. Countries with cadets at <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> are no longer necessarily <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allies. Soviet cadets may enter <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> classrooms next fall under a program approved by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration allowing <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> and Soviet military academies to exchange cadets for two-week visits. American cadets also have the opportunity to spend two weeks at a foreign military academy in one of more than 30 countries including <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Of more than 70 nations invited, 25 to 30 send applications. Many of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s strongest allies do not send cadets to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> member countries are invited but do n't participate, although a Canadian midshipman is attending the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION>. Foreign cadets do n't compete against American candidates, says academy spokeswoman <PERSON> Andrea </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamburger </PERSON>. `` These spaces are specifically designated for non-American cadets. They have to meet the same basic criteria as a cadet here would.'' At West Point all cadets eat the same food, adhere to the same dress code, take the same courses and meet the same requirements for graduation. In addition to chemistry, engineering, and science courses, they can study the history of technology and warfare, the American experience in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, space mechanics, terrain analysis, military computer systems, military ethics and nuclear reactor design. `` They are usually very, very serious students and good students. Depending on where they are from, some struggle with English,'' says <PERSON> Carrington </PERSON>. Some have more than a language barrier to overcome. <PERSON> Carrington </PERSON> recalls one cadet from an African tribe who had never flown on an airplane until he came to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>. He had only heard about water coming out of the walls, but had never seen or taken a shower and had to be shown how to drink out of a soda can. `` There is some culture shock, especially in the beginning,'' <PERSON> Carrington </PERSON> says. Otherwise, foreign cadets are not so different from American boys who grow up dreaming of going to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Natee </PERSON> <PERSON> Wongissares </PERSON> dreamed of becoming a West Point cadet. `` It was my life goal since I was 12 to get to West Point,'' he says. `` Since I saw a movie about <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> when he was a general I wanted to be just like him.''

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ Records were made to be broken, but sometimes, a bit of history fades with their passing.

 When <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Luhrs </PERSON> sailed into <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> on <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>'s Birthday in his 60-foot sloop Thursday's Child, he killed the last living remnant of one of the nation's most picturesque and romantic chapters, the era of the clipper ships. <PERSON> Luhrs </PERSON>' time of 80 days 20 hours from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> beat a record that had stood since 1854, when <PERSON> Millard </PERSON> <PERSON> Fillmore </PERSON> had just turned over the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> had an emperor and the world's first oil well was still five years away. The old mark of 89 days eight hours had held off challengers for 135 years. It had been set by the clipper Flying Cloud, a masterpiece of master shipbuilder <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>, which was navigated by the skipper's wife, Mrs. <PERSON> Josiah </PERSON> <PERSON> Creesy </PERSON>, with Himself at the helm. <PERSON> Creesy </PERSON>, his 40-odd member crew and his passengers were in a rush because there was gold in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. His cargo could fetch $ 1 an egg and $ 40 for a quart of whiskey. Clipper ships, the greyhounds of the sea, were built for speed. Anything fast in those days could be called a clipper. Clipper sleds. Clipper buggies. <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> Nova </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Scotia </LOCATION>, turned out swift, sharp-prowed and daringly overcanvased fliers at his yard in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. There were to be 14 instances when a tall ship logged more than 400 miles in 24 hours. Ten were McKay creations including the fastest, Champion of the Seas, which once covered 465 miles in a day's run. Flying Cloud, in fact, broke her own record in 1854. Three years earlier, with her white and gold goddess figurehead cutting the waves, Flying Cloud sped around the Horn with <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Creesy </PERSON> navigating past the rocks and through snow and gales to beat the old record by more than a week. The crew, who had blown out several topmasts under <PERSON> Creesy </PERSON>'s iron rule _ that time was money and speed advertising of the finest kind, promptly deserted for the gold fields. The clipper era was actually short-lived and marked the last undisputed primacy of the American merchant marine. American clippers in the opium trade to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> set speed records all over the world. Their names were as glorious as the ships: Comet, <ORGANIZATION> Eagle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wing </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Westward </PERSON> <PERSON> Ho </PERSON>, Sovereign of the Seas, <LOCATION> Young </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, Sea Witch. -LRB- Sea Witch sailed from <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in 74 days 14 hours in 1849 -RRB-. In getting to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> pronto in the 1850s to pan gold in the Sierras there was no lesser of evils. Overland there were Indians and deserts and mountains. Transshipping across the Isthmus of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> there were malaria and yellow fever. Around the Horn there was ... the Horn. Rounding the <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> is like walking up a dark alley at midnight with the <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> being the mugger. Rounding it east to west is particularly life-shortening because the westerlies whirl unimpeded around the world goaded by incessant storms into some of the most awesome waves in the world. A sailing vessel could spend a month battling gales to double the <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION>. Some gave up and turned around to sail to the Orient via the Cape of Good Hope at the tip of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. A speed merchant like the frosty-tempered <PERSON> Creesy </PERSON> keeping his foot to the pedal only made the hazards greater. The Americans had another unsung hero, <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Fontaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Maury </PERSON>. <PERSON> Maury </PERSON> was a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> lieutenant who had been beached due to a leg injury, so he was given a berth as superintendent of the sleepy <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Charts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Instruments </ORGANIZATION>. He began collecting log books from as many voyages as he could find and gradually drew up charts of wind patterns and currents. Armed with these, Americans became, briefly, monarchs of the oceans. The era did n't last because the Civil War concentrated the nation's energies away from the sea and because of the development of the ironclad steamboat <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>'s last clipper, the Glory of the Seas launched in 1868, ended her days as a frozen fish warehouse. About the only glory remaining were the old clipper records. Records and the seas have always conspired to lure mankind out of his easy chair. The Blue Ribband for the fastest time was always a coveted trophy in the heyday of the trans-Atlantic liners. But yachtsmen, if they ventured on the high seas at all, usually endured cold, wet and hunger until they reached distant ports at the other end. <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON> <PERSON> Slocum </PERSON>, another <PERSON> Nova </PERSON> <PERSON> Scotian </PERSON>, became the first amateur to sail alone around the world at the turn of the century but, with an old alarm clock as his navigational timepiece, he was not intent on speed. Indeed, he would freeload for months at a time en route at hospitable yacht clubs. With transoceanic jets leaving few worlds to conquer, however, yachtsmen increasingly looked to old records to test their mettle. Sir <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Chichester </PERSON> circled the globe with Gypsy Moth IV in 1966 at age 66 in 226 days with only one stop. Three years later another Englishman, <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Knox-Johnston </PERSON>, who a psychiatrist said was `` distressingly normal'' before and afterward, won a race around the world in 313 days to become the first non-stop, solo circumnavigator. Another contestant, a Frenchman named <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Moitessier </PERSON>, was winning on the home stretch. He decided, however, he preferred his own solitary company at sea to that of his fellow humans ashore and sailed on for another half of the globe, finally stopping in <LOCATION> Tahiti </LOCATION>. Since then, racing across large bodies of ocean alone or with crew has become commonplace. It has become particularly appealing to Frenchmen who excel at sailing high-speed multihull sailboats vast distances with occasional interruptions when the technology falls apart and sinks. <PERSON> Luhrs </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islander </LOCATION>, is also a transoceanic soloist as is <ORGANIZATION> Dodge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION>, a former journalist turned manufacturer, now living in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> after setting a non-stop record around the globe of 150 days. If <PERSON> Luhrs </PERSON>' record stands for another 135 years, it wo n't be for lack of challengers. Even as he finished under the Golden Gate Bridge, two <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> persons, <PERSON> Phillipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Monnet </PERSON> who left <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Jan. 8, and <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Liardet </PERSON>, a 27-year-old sailing with her fiance, had already rounded the Horn. <PERSON> Monnet </PERSON> reportedly hit an iceberg; <PERSON> Liardet </PERSON> was ahead of Flying Cloud's time but behind <PERSON> Luhrs </PERSON>'. <PERSON> Luhrs </PERSON> said on arrival in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> `` once is enough.'' This leaves <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Creesy </PERSON> with some consolation. She is the only navigator to have guided her husband around the Horn to a record _ twice.

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ Infertility is a problem among aging, wildborn gorillas, and few zoo gorillas were born in the wild. By adapting a human artificial fertilization technique for use on wildborn gorillas, scientists hope to expand the genetic pool and guard against inbreeding.

 <PERSON> Becky </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mimbo </PERSON> have the same problems as many infertile couples, but theirs have greater ramifications: They represent a possible threat to their species. Infertility among aging, wildborn gorillas prompted specialists to adapt a human artificial fertilization technique for use on <PERSON> Becky </PERSON>, a lowland gorilla at the <LOCATION> Cheyenne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zoo </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>. `` The hope is to have a diverse genetic pool so the gorillas do n't become inbred, by managing the population to the maximum genetic representation of all captive gorillas,'' says Dr. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Calle </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Cheyenne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zoo </LOCATION> veterinarian. `` If three of 10 gorillas are responsible for 80 percent of the offspring, the contribution of the others get lost over time.'' Estimates by experts on the wild gorilla population range from 10,000 to 70,000. Only 15 percent to 20 percent of the 297 captive gorillas in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> are wildborn, or of the foundation stock for carrying on the bloodline. Experts say many of them are reaching the end of their reproductive years. Such is the case with <PERSON> Becky </PERSON>, 32, and <PERSON> Mimbo </PERSON>, 26, who have just one surviving offspring. The <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cheyenne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> zoos are working under a two-year grant from the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. Last September, they assembled a team including zoo veterinarians, an infertility specialist and a reproductive physiologist to perform Gamete Intrafallopian Transfer -LRB- GIFT -RRB- on <PERSON> Becky </PERSON>. It was the first reproductive procedure ever tried on a gorilla, according to Dr. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Cambre </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> Zoo veterinarian. <PERSON> Becky </PERSON> did not become pregnant, but the surgery did provide information on the gorilla's reproductive system that could increase the chances for success when she undergoes the procedure again. Similarities in the reproductive systems of humans and gorillas make gorillas likely candidates for artificial fertilization techniques such as GIFT, says Dr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Yee </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION> infertility specialist who performed <PERSON> Becky </PERSON>'s surgery `` We learned that, like in humans, gorillas respond differently,'' <PERSON> Yee </PERSON> says. `` It seemed -LRB- <PERSON> Becky </PERSON>'s -RRB- eggs were not mature enough. `` In the normal process of reproduction, after the egg is released, the Fallopian tube picks up the egg from the ovary. Inside the Fallopian tube is where fertilization occurs. `` With Gamete IntraFallopian Transfer, we're placing the eggs and sperm inside the tube so when we're finished, we're assured the egg and sperm are present in the spot where fertilization occurs.'' GIFT has a live birthrate of 25 percent among women, compared with 17 percent with in-vitro fertilization, he says. Similar efforts have been made at the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zoo </LOCATION>, where three gorillas have undergone unsuccessful reproductive surgeries following <PERSON> Becky </PERSON>'s, says <PERSON> Naida </PERSON> <PERSON> Loskutoff </PERSON>, a Ph.D. candidate at <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> A </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; M who participated in <PERSON> Becky </PERSON>'s procedure. Eggs were collected for future artificial inseminations from a 32-year-old and a 17-year-old physically unable to bear offspring. The third, like <PERSON> Becky </PERSON> an infertile female in her 30s, was artifically inseminated, <PERSON> Loskutoff </PERSON> says. Conservationists find the prospect of apparently infertile gorillas producing offspring encouraging for the species' future. In cases where a species exists only in captivity, often because of habitat destruction, zoos have crossed the line from entertainment to conservation to ensure the species' survival, <PERSON> Cambre </PERSON> says. The goal in such cases is to return the species to the wild once survival can be ensured, he says. Their numbers do n't place lowland gorillas among the most endangered species, but they are among the biggest draws to zoos. Experts say their popularity has increased since the recent film, `` Gorillas in the Mist,'' which depicts <PERSON> Dian </PERSON> <PERSON> Fossey </PERSON>'s work with the more severely endangered mountain gorilla. `` If you sit and watch a family of gorillas, you see a little insight to human behavior,'' says <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>, coordinator of the Species Survival Plan gorilla committee based at <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s Lincoln Park Zoo. Natural breeding among captive gorilla groups is preferred over surgical procedures, and <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> says the natural method is proving increasingly successful, especially among larger zoo populations. `` Our breeding program in our <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> SSP has definitely turned the corner,'' <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> says. To that end, the <ORGANIZATION> SSP </ORGANIZATION> committee for lowland gorillas documents the family trees of captive gorillas in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and monitors inter-zoo transfers of the animals to avoid inbreeding and the subsequent loss of genetic diversity. `` Genetic diversity means the animals carry a variety of genes, representing a cross-section of the population,'' <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> says. `` In the wild, if you have normal groups, you would have total genetic diversity. `` Since we are no longer taking the animal from the wild, we are dealing with a captive population and we have to look at a bigger picture so we can look specifically at the problems of managing husbandry and reproduction.''

 Deputy District Attorney <PERSON> Grace </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> frequently stumbles over her own seriousness. `` Grace is very much in her element in the courtroom,'' says actress <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dey </PERSON>, who plays her on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` <LOCATION> L.A </LOCATION>. Law.'' `` But I battle with her in terms of how serious she is.'' At the moment, <PERSON> Dey </PERSON> is prosecuting another of <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>'s hopeless cases, outfoxed by a sly attorney and facing a jury swayed by sympathetic defendants. On the courtroom set on a sound stage at 20th <ORGANIZATION> Century </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION>, three old-timers are on trial for robbing a bank. <PERSON> Lew </PERSON> <PERSON> Ayres </PERSON>, 81, white-thatched and slightly stooped, has the jury hanging on every word. `` They robbed the bank because they could n't draw out their senior citizens money,'' he says `` They're very sweet men,'' concedes prosecutor <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>, adding, `` who committed a very serious crime.'' She does n't smile. Her suit, a black-and-gray striped jacket with padded shoulders and a black skirt, reinforces her no-nonsense attitude. Although some of the comic scenes in `` <LOCATION> L.A. </LOCATION> Law'' are played at her expense, <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> is by no means a loser. As the love interest of attorney <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuzak </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamlin </PERSON> -RRB-, she's bright and talented, beautiful and sexy. Back at the makeup trailer parked outside the stage, <PERSON> Dey </PERSON> ponders the paradox that is Grace. `` She's in a very serious environment. She feels safest when she's at work. She's most insecure when she's away from that environment,'' <PERSON> Dey </PERSON> says `` I like her best in a dilemma, when the crisis comes. In a dramatic or comedic conflict. She has a vulnerability in a conflict. She's really a powerful woman. She's strong. When something gets to her, it's wonderful. She gets frustrated. She can be outwitted because she's so serious. Her determination boxes her in.'' Makeup artists <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> and Candy Conery work on her face for the next scene. Then <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON>, her 10-year-old, enters the trailer. `` Boo-Boo's here!'' <PERSON> Dey </PERSON> exclaims, jumping off the high makeup chair to hug her. <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> is from a previous marriage. <PERSON> Dey </PERSON> is now married to television producer <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Sofronski </PERSON>. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> is n't known for doing things on impulse, but on a show early this year she did suddenly kiss <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Sifuentes </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Smits </PERSON> -RRB-. `` Nothing's come of that yet,'' says <PERSON> Dey </PERSON>. `` For us, the moment was so wonderful for Grace to fulfill this fantasy. But there's no talk that anything will come of it. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Bochco </PERSON> said it was just something Grace has always wanted to do. `` That was one of the few times I got to work with other members of the cast besides <PERSON> Harry </PERSON>. I'm usually in court. It was a new experience and it was fun, too. I'm kind of lucky. There's a lot of give and take. I work the long hours in the courtroom, which makes you kind of crazy. But I get to work with all these wonderful guest stars.'' She was not in the `` L.A. Law'' pilot, but was cast after running into executive producer <PERSON> Bochco </PERSON> at a school function for their children. <PERSON> Bochco </PERSON> was looking for a love interest for <PERSON> Kuzak </PERSON>, as well as another view of the law. <PERSON> Dey </PERSON> says she spent about a month in court with a deputy public defender researching an earlier role for another pilot. She used that as background for the character of <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>. The daughter of a newspaper editor from upstate <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dey </PERSON> had done commercials and modeling before making her debut as <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> in `` The Partridge Family'' in 1970. The show, starring <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Cassidy </PERSON>, was about a singing family. `` It was pure luck that I got ` The Partridge Family,''' says <PERSON> Dey </PERSON>. `` I thought I was an adult. I was 16 when I did the pilot and 17 when we started the show. I was 21 when we finished.'' Her next series was `` Loves Me, Loves Me Not,'' a romantic comedy co-starring <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilman </PERSON> that lasted only a few weeks in 1977. She was also in the short-lived CBS prime-time soap opera `` Emerald Point N.A.S.''

 Acting in the comedy `` Cafe Crown,'' at <ORGANIZATION> Broadway </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Brooks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atkinson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theater </ORGANIZATION>, is `` like being in a musical without having to sing,'' says <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` It's such a joyous play to do. There are 18 actors; it's an ensemble piece. Audiences seem to have a really good time.'' <PERSON> Eli </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s husband of 41 years, plays flamboyant impresario-actor <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> in `` Cafe Crown.'' His actress wife plays his actress wife. `` Cafe Crown'' is a revival of <PERSON> Hy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON>'s 1942 comedy, which was the first Broadway success for director <PERSON> Elia </PERSON> <PERSON> Kazan </PERSON>. It's set in the real Cafe Royal, which opened in 1920 amid 80 Yiddish theaters, a haven for deal-making actors and eccentric waiters. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>'s character is fighting to keep Yiddish theater alive. Another character, a gifted young actor based on <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Muni </PERSON>, wants to leave the Yiddish theater for <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>. `` Remember those ads, ` You do n't have to be Jewish to like <PERSON> Levy </PERSON>'s rye bread?' <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> says. `` You do n't have to be Jewish to enjoy ` Cafe Crown.' `` It's a family play, well-plotted. The play reflects <PERSON> Hy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON>'s personality There is no meanness in it, no discomfort. `` The decline of the Yiddish theater was based on the fact that young people did n't want to learn Yiddish,'' <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> adds. `` I did n't learn it. When my parents argued, they spoke Polish, German or Yiddish.'' <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>'s most difficult acting in `` Cafe Crown'' is telling the young actor he'll release him from his contract, giving him a chance at <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>. `` It's a very moving thing to me,'' <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> says. `` I say, ` What right have I to demand your sacrifice?' One generation is saying to another, ` We must move on. ` It's in only two lines In acting, you just have to go along with the notes _ like music.'' The couple has acted together in <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> <PERSON> Schisgal </PERSON>'s `` The Typist and the Tiger,'' `` Luv'' and `` Twice Around the Park.'' `` Cafe Crown'' opened in October off-Broadway at the Public Theater. A hit, it moved to Broadway Feb. 18. <PERSON> Fyvush </PERSON> <PERSON> Finkel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Fibich </PERSON>, both veterans of Yiddish theater, are in the cast. So is <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dishy </PERSON>. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> turned down a film to do the Broadway run. `` The movie was interesting but I love doing the play,'' he says. `` I did n't want to go to <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> for two months I'd rather spend it on Broadway.'' In 1953 he turned down the role of <PERSON> Maggio </PERSON> _ which then went to <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON> _ in the film `` From Here to Eternity.'' He says, `` It was the choice between that or a brilliant play by <ORGANIZATION> Tennessee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Williams </ORGANIZATION>, ` Camino Real,' where he'd tailored a role for me. <PERSON> Kazan </PERSON> was directing. It was n't an act of heroism. It was a choice. `` I'm a contented actor. I read of actors making $ 800,000. I'm happy doing what I'm doing `` Once the ego drive to be in the limelight, to make a killing, to be the biggest, flattens out, you begin to relish the work for the work. `` We paid our dues in the theater,'' says <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>. `` We spent years working with great stars, learning from the ground up. We were bequeathed certain values in the theater that are important to us. So when we find projects we want to do, we do them.'' Miss <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is writing a second book. Her first, `` Early Stages,'' ends with the birth of the couple's son, now a married father of two little boys who's working on special effects on `` Star Trek 5.'' The couple's two daughters are actresses, one married, one getting married in May. Though they also act independently, Miss <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> says, `` We do have a lot of fun working together. We're both quite good character actors. The characterizations that we come up with make it seem like it's a different person we're relating to.'' <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>'s acting in `` Cafe Crown'' changes, he says, depending on what <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dishy </PERSON> does as the legendary Cafe Royal busboy. `` I never know if he's going to be polite or irascible. There's a little mystery in his acting, which is why he's always interesting.'' The rather small part of Mrs. <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> originally did n't appeal to Miss <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` I thought they just wanted me because of <PERSON> Eli </PERSON>. When I got involved in it, I realized it was better than I thought,'' she says. `` Her role is very important in ` Cafe Crown,''' says <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>. `` They talk about her before she comes on. She has one scene with me and one scene in the final act. It's really not much. But it's so carefully woven into the fabric of the play that the character emerges very strongly.'' `` It was a surprise to me,'' the actress says. `` And it's fun to play.'' One day, during the off-Broadway run, Miss <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> climbed on a chair in their apartment, fell and missed four performances. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> opens his mouth to comment on her understudy, hears `` Be careful what you say about how good she was'' from his spouse and says mildly, `` I was happy when you came back.''

 Like a monument to the end of <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION>'s age of innocence, the <ORGANIZATION> Bahia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paraiso </ORGANIZATION>'s badly gashed orange hull rises out of ice-blue waters. Penguins calmly perch atop the overturned vessel, unaware of the danger in thin oily sheen in the water around them. Most of the tens of thousands of gallons of diesel fuel that spilled out in the shipwreck Jan. 28 has since evaporated, but more is slowly leaking. Times are changing at <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>'s last frontier. Countries eager to stake or reinforce their claims to a slice of the Frozen Continent are dispatching ships and aircraft, bulldozers and amphibious trucks. With nationalistic fanfare, they are building new bases and launching new research projects. During the austral summer, well-heeled tourists arrive by the hundreds each week on cruise ships, supply vessels or military transport planes contracted by specilized travel agencies. Even private yachts and polar skiing expeditions are venturing into the last place on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> where no passport is needed. Accidents are happening, and in the case of the <LOCATION> Bahia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paraiso </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> wildlife paid the price. A host of legal, environmental and highly political questions are surging up like the hazardous icebergs in <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION>'s poorly charted seas. `` You're confronted daily with an ever-hastening chain of events,'' <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkniss </PERSON>, polar programs chief for the Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, told a visiting <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> correspondent at Palmer Station. The foundation directs all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> research in <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wilkniss </PERSON> advocates increased international regulation. `` There's nothing that prevents anyone from doing anything they want,'' he said. `` I do n't think we can live with that situation.'' He described the continent's 5.1 million square miles as `` a judicial no-man's land.'' No laws apply to <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION> because no one owns it, according to the terms of the Antarctic Treaty. The pact was signed in 1961 by 12 countries who agreed to put all territorial claims on hold for at least 30 years and reserve <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION> for peaceful research. Eight other nations since have joined the treaty with full voting powers, while an additional 18 have agreed to abide by its provisions and hold observer status. The treaty nations meet about every two years. The organization recently drafted a plan to permit strictly regulated exploration and exploitation of the continent's mineral resources after 1991, when the treaty itself is up for review. But it is only beginning to grapple with such issues as the proliferation of bases, marine and air safety, indemnification, and medical and rescue facilities. The wreck of the <LOCATION> Bahia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paraiso </LOCATION> exemplifies the region's predicament The 435-foot supply and research vessel, operated by the Argentine navy, called on Palmer Station in glacier-rimmed <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Bay </PERSON> on Jan. 28 so the 81 tourists on board could take a look around. It also carried a crew of 235. On its way out of the bay, it ran aground in a passage marked on sea charts as containing `` danger ledges and pinnacles.'' Crew and passengers got off safely in lifeboats and found shelter at the station. The ship, over a period of four days, gradually rolled over and sank. About 180,000 gallons of diesel oil from its storage tanks spilled into the water. During the austral summer season, more than 30 cruises were scheduled to call on <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>, bringing an average 100 tourists on each occasion. Tourism is uncontrolled and, to some, out of control. `` In 1982, we got three cruise ships all season,'' said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> ITT-Antarctic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, which is contracted to supply and maintain Palmer Station. `` This year we got as many as five a week. We'd sometimes get two in one day.'' The Science Foundation briefly tried to ban tourist visits last year, arguing that it interfered with research. But the ban was lifted when influential Americans complained, claiming a right to see how their tax dollars are being spent. The <LOCATION> Bahia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paraiso </LOCATION>'s tourists included 46 Americans who paid from $ 3,000 to nearly $ 7,000 for the cruise The station's staff includes a medical corpsman with a small one-room clinic for treating the two to four dozen people at the base. It is not designed for handling a maritime disaster.

<HEAD>PALMER STATION: maritime disaster.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 And station workers said only fair weather prevented a disaster. They said most of the <LOCATION> Bahia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paraiso </LOCATION>'s lifeboats were open, inflatable rafts without oars or motors. The day was calm and they could be towed ashore by station workboats without difficulty. But they could have overturned or been blown out to sea if the volatile Antarctic weather had taken a turn for the worse, the workers said. In response to the diesel spill, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> dispatched navy and civilian pollution control experts with 52 tons of specialized equipment. The mission cost more than $ 2 million. The Chilean and Argentine navies also sent costly clean-up missions. The clean-up ended in mid-March, although the <LOCATION> Bahia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paraiso </LOCATION> still holds about 63,000 gallons that ca n't be safely reached and pumped out. It could spill if the ship breaks up in a winter storm or simply seep out for many months as the wreck gradually disintegrates. Experts say it would be too costly to haul the wreck away. The area of the spill teems with wildlife, including penguins, skuas, cormorants, Arctic terns and other birds. Seals and whales frequently pass through the bay. Scientists say there already exists indirect evidence that many penguins and other birds were poisoned by the spill, but they have been unable to determine the extent of the damage. A special team of 15 researchers from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> has arrived to begin a comprehensive study on the spill's environmental impact. It will take years to complete. Yet there is no way a claim for damages can be made. Since the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has no property rights to the area at or around <LOCATION> Palmer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION>, it has no legal grounds for seeking compensation. The area of the accident, on the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>, is claimed by <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> recently announced plans to propose, at the next <ORGANIZATION> Antarctic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> meeting in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> in October, an article to hold each country financially responsible for environmental or other damage. The Science Foundation plans to press for agreement on cost sharing in clean-up of spills and other accidents, and for formation of an international coordinating office for emergencies. But there could be some opposition. `` We must act with prudence, without falling into decisions that could be a little hasty,'' said <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Daverede </PERSON>, head of <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> affairs for the <ORGANIZATION> Argentine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> claims a thick wedge of the continent and, like the other claimant nations, rejects any foreign or international jurisdiction. <PERSON> Daverede </PERSON> played down the effects of the <LOCATION> Bahia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paraiso </LOCATION> spill. `` This is far from being a natural catastrophe,'' he said. He called the wreck `` an isolated incident.'' Nonetheless, less than a month after the <ORGANIZATION> Bahia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paraiso </ORGANIZATION> accident a Peruvian research ship ran aground 300 miles away, near <LOCATION> King </LOCATION> <LOCATION> George </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. The vessel, called the Humboldt and touted as the flagship of <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s territorial claim, also spilled some diesel fuel but was soon refloated. By world standards neither accident would qualify as a major environmental disaster. `` I've walked away from bigger diesel spills than this where nothing died, absolutely nothing,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Gretna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, a pollution control expert hired by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government for the <ORGANIZATION> Bahia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paraiso </ORGANIZATION> clean-up. But there is special concern that <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION>'s environment may be especially fragile. There's also a growing belief that its huge cold mass plays a key role in long-term global weather patterns. There also are some indications that the strain on the local environment may be straining political relations. For decades, a unique spirit of international friendship and cooperation has reigned in <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION>. Political conficts were left at the doorstep, and missions from such idealogically distinct countries as the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and right-wing <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> lived as next-door neighbors, sharing supplies, equipment and a drink or two on the cold nights. In early March, however, the Chileans criticized what they called the poor waste handling at the Soviet Bellinghousen base, literally a stone's from their own <PERSON> Marsh </PERSON> base on <LOCATION> King </LOCATION> <LOCATION> George </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. They said they would file a complaint at the next treaty meeting.

 For two decades scientists enjoyed a cloistered existence at this <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> research center, studying wildlife in conditions as unspoiled as anywhere in the world. No longer. The mission of <ORGANIZATION> Palmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION>, perched on a gravelly point beneath a towering glacier, changed overnight when the Argentine supply ship <ORGANIZATION> Bahia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paraiso </ORGANIZATION> ran aground Jan. 28 and spilled its cargo of diesel fuel just offshore. `` This is changing from a place where people studied untouched nature long-term to a place where people study the effects of an oil spill long-term,'' said <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubega </PERSON>, an ornithologist from <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California-Irvine </ORGANIZATION>. She was studying skuas and kelp gulls at the station when the wreck occurred. `` As an ecosystem that was basically undisturbed, it's a horrible loss. Really it's tragic,'' Miss <PERSON> Rubega </PERSON> said. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Fraser </PERSON>, an ornithologist from the <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reyes </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> -RRB- Bird Observatory, said there already are indications of some poisoning of penguins, skuas, cormorants and other bird species that populate the rocky islands around the spill. `` We have no direct evidence of heavy mortality, but we have indirect evidence,'' he said. Scavanging giant petrels who live on the rocky islands around the base were feeding their newborn chicks an unusually rich diet of penguin meat after the spill, <PERSON> Fraser </PERSON> said. `` What this means is you had large numbers of penguins dying locally.'' In addition, 726 pairs of polar skuas were nesting in the area when the spill occurred. `` Every single one lost their chicks,'' <PERSON> Frazer </PERSON> said. He stressed that the evidence was not conclusive. A team of 15 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> scientists has just begun more comprehensive studies. Ironically, the site offers an excellent base of information for a before-and-after examination of a spill. The wealth of data on bird and marine life collected since the station went into operation can be used for comparison, <PERSON> Fraser </PERSON> said. `` It's a terrible disaster, but it's an incredible natural experiment.''

 ABOARD THE R @ _ Ship captain <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> <PERSON> Philpott </PERSON> says a chill runs through him every time he passes Sail Rock. The 91-foot pinnacle rises out of waters 700 feet deep like a sailor's bad dream. `` You get to wondering how many -LRB- others -RRB- are lying just under the water,'' <PERSON> Philpott </PERSON> said. According to <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> sea charts, plenty of them are on the jagged bottom at <LOCATION> Sail </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Deception </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, ready to rip through the strongest of hulls like the reinforced one of the Polar Duke, a modern <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> research ship. But even the charts ca n't be trusted. They are loaded with hazards marked `` PA'' -LRB- position approximate -RRB- and `` ED'' -LRB- existence doubtful -RRB-. Some areas have never been sounded. `` There's a lot of old data being used,'' <PERSON> Philpott </PERSON> said. Throw in roving icebergs as tall as high-rise buildings and sudden storms with winds up to 90 knots or more, and you've got a place where even the best-run ship may well bump into something sooner or later. The 219-foot Polar Duke has state-of-the-art navigational equipment, including two radars, two depth sounders and a site-scan sonar. Nonetheless, it ran into uncharted shoals two years ago and put a $ 1-million dent in the hull. A British ice-breaker, the Endurance, hit an iceberg earlier this year and still had a patched hull when it came to the assistance of a grounded Peruvian research ship, the <LOCATION> Humboldt </LOCATION>, in late February. <PERSON> Philpott </PERSON> said he `` grew up on the ice'' of his native <LOCATION> Newfoundland </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and has navigated in <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION> since 1985. Experience is essential, he said. But the increasing number of ships plying the Antarctic coast is raising questions about the judgment of some crews. When the Argentine research vessel <ORGANIZATION> Bahia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paraiso </ORGANIZATION> wrecked on shoals Jan. 28, it was attempting to cruise through an area marked on sea charts with the warning: `` Dangerous Ledges and Pinnacles.'' Once upon a time, a ship in these waters sailed virtually alone. On a recent 8,500-mile expedition, however, the Chilean ship Capitan <PERSON> Alcazar </PERSON> reported sighting 27 other vessels, including two private yachts and three tourist cruise ships, from a host of countries from <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. More traffic is expected to produce more mishaps. But according to <PERSON> Philpott </PERSON> there's a saving grace: it also means more ships to come to your rescue. `` The biggest danger is the lack of other ships if you do get in trouble,'' he said.

 GEOGRAPHY: <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION> is 5.1 million square miles in area, larger than all of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and now has been determined to have 17,500 miles of rugged coastline. Its uneven surface of rock and gravel descends toward the center like a soup bowl, under the vast weight of a rounded cap of ice more than a mile deep in some places. The total volume of ice on the continent is equivalent to 72 percent of all water on earth. The continent is divided by the <LOCATION> Transantarctic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Range </LOCATION> and includes other clusters of peaks including <PERSON> Visson </PERSON> <PERSON> Massif </PERSON>, the highest at 16,864 feet above sea level.

<TEXT>
 An ambitious experiment to allow <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> to own their homes has halted in this seaside city because of complaints from powerful officials and austerity policies in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. Other experiments in housing reform throughout <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> are also off to a slow start due to the sky-high price of living space and lack of confidence in the government. `` The policies are in contradiction. We do n't know what the future holds,'' said <PERSON> Qin </PERSON> <PERSON> Shiyu </PERSON>, a housing reform official in <LOCATION> Yantai </LOCATION>, a breezy town in <LOCATION> Shandong </LOCATION> province on the <LOCATION> Bohai </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, apartments cost the equivalent of about $ 45 a square foot, meaning that an average college graduate would have to save his total income for 70 years to buy a basic three-room flat. In crowded <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> prices can be even higher. A recent report by the official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said living space per person in a <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> neighborhood amounted to nine by nine feet, or 54 square feet. `` And that's only for the relatively well off,'' it said. Thousands, it said, were living in 21.6 square feet of space. In <LOCATION> Yantai </LOCATION>, prices have been more reasonable and 1,600 homes have been sold in about two years. But 16,000 families are still waiting for a chance to buy. <PERSON> Yu </PERSON> <PERSON> Bingmo </PERSON>, a worker at the <ORGANIZATION> Yantai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Synthetic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Factory </ORGANIZATION>, was lucky. In October, he scraped together his life savings, took out a loan and bought his three-room, 600-square-foot apartment _ or about 30 feet by 20 feet _ for about 12,000 yuan -LRB- $ 3,243 -RRB-. `` It may mean a few more years of lousy cigarettes but I was willing to take the risk,'' said <PERSON> Yu </PERSON>, 57, as he sat with his wife in the living room. `` It's not a palace but at least it's mine.'' <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> began housing reform in the mid-1980s in an attempt to correct a serious housing shortage that had left millions of Chinese urban dwellers with nowhere to live. The plan picked up urgency over the past few years as part of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s effort to reform its heavily subsidized housing system. In <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s countryside, houses are privately owned and passed from generation to generation. But in the cities, home to 40 percent of the country's 1.1 billion people, housing has been built and maintained by state funds and rented at rock-bottom prices. `` <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s housing industry is a welfare undertaking making no profits at all,'' said a recent edition of the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Review. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> also looked at private housing as a way to channel people's money into the country's infrastructure and halt spending on consumer goods They reasoned that less consumer spending would limit record high inflation of around 30 percent. In addition, reformers wanted to battle corrupt officials who use their power to secure bigger and better apartments for themselves and their friends. In 1986, <LOCATION> Yantai </LOCATION> and three other cities were selected as the first group of pilot cities for urban housing reform. In <LOCATION> Yantai </LOCATION>, rent was raised almost 2000 percent to 1.24 yuan a square meter -LRB- 3 cents a square foot -RRB-. To Chinese accustomed to paying around 3 percent of their salaries for rent the jump was substantial. Next, the housing department ordered businesses in the city to add a subsidy of 23.5 percent of each worker's salary to his paycheck to make up for the rent increase. As rent payments to work units increased, the state cut the amount it gave them for housing. Residents were also made responsible for the upkeep of their homes. `` You've got a broken toilet, well fix it yourself,'' said <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Qingyuan </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Real </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Yantai </LOCATION>. `` The end result is that people are being made more responsible for their lives.'' Workers were encouraged to buy their houses at cut-rate prices, one-tenth to one-fifth of the market rate. Special low - or no-interest loans were offered To discourage speculation, resale was permitted only after five years. The sales pace was quick. But, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s economy was overheating. To cut spending, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s Cabinet, ordered all money received in the sales of housing frozen in bank accounts for two years. And the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> clamped a 40 percent tax on those funds. Other problems were brewing. <LOCATION> Yantai </LOCATION>, known for its clean air and fresh fish, is a retirement area for some of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s most powerful former officials. When rents went up, they complained. Some went on rent strikes, others used `` connections'' to avoid paying. The effect on <LOCATION> Yantai </LOCATION>'s reform was deadening. Work units, which own all the housing, stopped selling. A halt in sales meant housing construction stopped. `` We were like a truck moving downhill and then somebody slammed on the brakes,'' said one official. `` It was a pretty big shock.'' Other cities, like <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, have also begun housing reform but to them it only means putting a few houses on the market. Their success has been even less notable than <LOCATION> Yantai </LOCATION>'s. Because housing prices are so high and no attempts have been made to change the rent system, only successful individual businessmen, still a rarity in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, are able to afford their own home. On a recent afternoon, <PERSON> Sun </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaofeng </PERSON>, a cab driver who makes 300 yuan -LRB- $ 81 -RRB- a month, a good deal by Chinese standards, strolled into the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Real Estate Exchange. `` I'm just curious,'' he said. `` I'll never be able to buy a house, not in 10,000 years.''

 `` Slaves of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'' The film production team of <ORGANIZATION> Ismail </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merchant </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Ivory </PERSON> has specialized in literary adapations, creating such cinematic jewels as `` A Room With a View,'' `` Maurice'' and `` The Bostonians.'' All three movies had their bases in works with rich backdrops and meaty characters. Now they've used their production and directorial skills in trying to turn a hunk of coal into a diamond. Unfortunately, `` Slaves of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'' does n't glitter. It's still a rough, dark lump. `` Slaves of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'' is also a meandering melange of superficialites. It was written by <PERSON> Tama </PERSON> <PERSON> Janowitz </PERSON>, who also wrote the book of short stories from which it was adapted. Both are shallow works. There is no flesh and not even an interesting skeleton upon which to fashion a story that will grab us, inspire us, make us feel something or just entertain us. The action, such as it is, takes place in the self-absorbed and limited downtown art world, an environment that works hard at causing narcolepsy. <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Bernadette </PERSON> <PERSON> Peters </PERSON> -RRB-, a copyreader at an <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> newspaper, is an artsy type _ she designs outrageous hats. She also is massively insecure and does n't think she measures up to her bohemian friends. She lives with a pseudo-artist named Stash -LRB- <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> -RRB- who dots the world with all those cookie cutter cartoons and graffiti-like drawings the downtown world calls art. The miserably highstrung Stash is having an affair with <PERSON> Daria </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Madeleine </PERSON> <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> -RRB- who's having an affair with <PERSON> Marley </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Corri </PERSON> -RRB-. `` Slaves of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'' is <PERSON> Bernadette </PERSON> <PERSON> Peters </PERSON> first movie role since 1981's `` Pennies From Heaven.'' Since then, she's gone on to greater glory on Broadway, receiving a Tony award from her performance as Dot in <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sondheim </PERSON>'s `` Sunday in the Park With <PERSON> George </PERSON>,'' and starring in `` Song and Dance'' and `` Into the Woods.''

<TEXT>
 `` Moon Over Parador'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> Home Video. VHS-Beta, $ 89.95. Rated PG-13 -RRB- The farce `` Moon Over Parador'' is better than it seems at first, but it's nowhere near as good as it could be, with <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazursky </PERSON> as director and actors <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dreyfuss </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sonia </PERSON> <PERSON> Braga </PERSON> and <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Julia </PERSON>. It's a little like `` Tootsie'' goes `` Bananas.'' <PERSON> Dreyfuss </PERSON>, who puts in a very good performance, plays an ambitious actor in search of a really meaty role. He inadvertently finds it when he is kidnapped to fill in when the dictator of a <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> country -LRB- Parador -RRB- where he'd been at work on a film dies. <PERSON> Julia </PERSON> is the evil police chief, the power behind the power. <PERSON> Braga </PERSON>, who had been the dictator's mistress, takes <PERSON> Dreyfuss </PERSON> on and gets him to do some good in her country. But underneath it all, the movie is about acting and entertaining. <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Winters </PERSON>, <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Rey </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Asner </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavett </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ike </PERSON> <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON> make appearances. <PERSON> Julia </PERSON>'s character, educated at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, talks about <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> and is fascinated with acting and movie making. In Parador, <PERSON> Dreyfuss </PERSON>' character gets a copy of the <ORGANIZATION> Sunday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> and reads about acting opportunities. <PERSON> Dreyfuss </PERSON> and <PERSON> Braga </PERSON> `` perform'' for an applauding crowd of Paradorans at a beach by smooching. As dictator, <PERSON> Dreyfuss </PERSON> recreates a scene in which the real dictator visited the shooting of a film in <LOCATION> Parador </LOCATION>. And <PERSON> Mazursky </PERSON> himself appears, cross-dressing as the late dictator's mother. And finally, when <PERSON> Drefuss </PERSON> leaves Parador to return to the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> acting scene he left, he bids farewell to <LOCATION> Braga </LOCATION> in what he exclaims to be a moment right out of `` Casablanca.'' But for all the attention to acting, many of the lines leave much to be desired and simply fall flat. When the dictator passes out drunk, <PERSON> Julia </PERSON> looks at him and says, `` He ca n't drink anymore. His liver is totally damaged.'' Still, there is much in the movie that is witty and fun.

 `` A Summer to Remember'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> Home Video. VHS-Beta, $ 39.95. Rated PG -RRB- `` A Summer to Remember'' does have <PERSON> Tess </PERSON> <PERSON> Harper </PERSON>, a cute orangutan and a couple of kids who triumph over adults. But it is so syrupy that it's hard to swallow. The film, directed by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, is about a deaf boy -LRB- <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerlis </PERSON> -RRB- who feels isolated and extremely angry after his dad leaves him and his mother -LRB- <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> -RRB- and sister. His stepfather -LRB- <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Farentino </PERSON> -RRB- tries desperately to reach him and break him from his shell. But what it takes to bring him out is an unlikely relationship he and his sister develop with an escaped ape who has been trained to speak in sign language. It's a clever idea, and the acting is fine. Also in the cast are <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON>, <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bridgette </PERSON> <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON>. The movie deals well with the difficulties that can develop between a stepfather and stepson, and with the way the world can seem to a deaf boy. But it hits the audience over the head with its good intentions. Especially heavy-handed are the music and and a slow-motion scene in which the kids tumble in a field with their orangutan pal.

 `` Born to Burn'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ <PERSON> Ethel </PERSON> and the <PERSON> Shameless </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussies </PERSON> <PERSON> Ethel </PERSON> and the Shameless Hussies, working at some lonesome intersection where the Andrews Sisters meet <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Wills </PERSON>, are really a lot more talented than the dopey names and outrageous outfits would have you believe. In fact, that's the problem here _ the joke quickly wears thin, pulling down what could be a real up-and-coming country band with a difference. `` Ethel'' and her polyester pals, `` Bunni'' and `` Blanche,'' we are led to believe, are three good ol' gals who were all married to the same lout. They sing clever things _ `` I Thought He Was Mr. Right, But He Left'' _ and wear a lot of animal prints and semi-naughty corsets. But amid the schlock, there is some quality. Their singing is right on the mark, and their sound leans to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> swing, the rebirth of which is the happiest country music trend in a long time. In real life, <PERSON> Ethel </PERSON> even comes with credentials: She's actually the songwriter <PERSON> Kacey </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, who co-wrote the <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilley </PERSON> hit `` I'm the One Mama Warned You About,'' which is reprised on `` Born to Burn.''

 `` Mystery Girl'' -LRB- Virgin -RRB- <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Orbison </PERSON> <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Orbison </PERSON>'s sudden death last December makes it hard to objectively consider this `` comeback album.'' Is it really good, or does sentimentality make it seem so? It's really good. Not perfect, but it would have been a hit even if <PERSON> Orbison </PERSON> had n't succumbed to a heart attack. <PERSON> Orbison </PERSON> imports an all-star crew to help him, including <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Petty </PERSON> and most of his Heartbreakers, <PERSON> Bono </PERSON> and The Edge of U2, <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynne </PERSON>, <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> <PERSON> Costello </PERSON>, <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Cropper </PERSON> and a host of studio stars. All <PERSON> Orbison </PERSON> needed to bring was that sweet, other-worldly voice. `` You Got It,'' the single, is successful for the same reason as the Traveling Wilburys _ it's light, breezy `` feel good'' pop. But the meat of the album are the <PERSON> Bono </PERSON> and Edge-composed `` She's a Mystery to Me'' and <PERSON> Costello </PERSON>'s `` The Comedians. The spare arrangement of the former lays bare a tale of romantic torment. `` The Comedians'' adds a bizarre new twist to romantic loss: The narrator is left stuck on the top of a ferris wheel while his girlfriend walks off holding the operator's hand. The song builds to a dramatic climax before <PERSON> Orbison </PERSON> leaves the listener, like himself, hanging in mid-air. Each of the album's 10 songs go down easily, with only `` -LRB- All I Can Do Is -RRB- Dream You'' having much of a rock' n' roll kick. That eventually becomes a problem. Songs such as `` A Love So Beautiful,'' `` Windsurfer'' and `` The Only One'' are predictable and tend to blend together after awhile. <PERSON> Orbison </PERSON> was successful when he tackled challenging material; he should have tried it a few more times. Still, this Rock' n' Roll Hall of Fame member managed to thrust himself onto the contemporary scene without looking foolish. That happens less often than it seems. _ By <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bauder </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 Lieder by <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Schubert </PERSON>; <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Battle </PERSON>, soprano, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, Piano -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Deutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grammaphon </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Battle </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> present a varied selection of Schubert songs, spanning a broad emotional range. In the first half, <ORGANIZATION> Battle </ORGANIZATION> sings mostly about the sunnier side of love. Her light, supple voice is perfectly suited to <PERSON> Schubert </PERSON>'s setting of <PERSON> Goethe </PERSON>'s `` Liebhaber in allen Gestalten,'' with its repeated line, `` Would that I were a fish, so nimble and agile. Those words nicely sum up Battle's fine voice. Her instrument changes color for the interesting `` An die Laute,'' in which a young man confides his love to a lute. <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, whose pianism is as welcome as his podium work, perfectly approximates the sound of the lute in the accompaniment. This recording amply demonstrates that Battle does not lack for charm, and does not hesitate to show it. The listener is won over on the eighth track, a hauntingly beautiful lullaby called `` Nacht und Traume.'' She sings softly throughout with a heart-aching sweetness. The song is about the joy men take in their dreams, and ends with a depressing conclusion _ a call for a return to sleep when day breaks. The program now takes a darker turn. Battle sings of aching hearts in `` Rastlose Liebe,'' or `` restless love,'' and the turbulent night of a young nun awaiting her Saviour like a trembling bride in `` Die junge Nonne.'' Finally comes the wondrous `` Shepherd on the Rock,'' which transverses the range of a lover's emotions _ yearning, grief, loneliness, longing and the joy of anticipation. To some tastes, this song is better for a deeper voice, and Battle has trouble with some of the low notes. But she sings with conviction and attention to detail. Clarinettist <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Leister </PERSON> is flawless, sounding like a cool mountain stream bubbling over polished rocks. _ By <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Wakin </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 It was 200 years ago that <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> citizens overthrew King <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> XVI </PERSON>, beginning a bloody revolution that was to reverberate throughout <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Bastille Day, July 14, the day in 1789 when the French revolutionaries stormed and destroyed the state prison in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> is the national holiday of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. A reconstruction of the Bastille and `` the world's biggest ball'' are just two of the events marking the celebration of the bicentennial of the French Revolution taking place in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in the coming months. Those thirsty for `` revolutionary'' wine will find it at the Salon des Vins at the <LOCATION> Porte </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Versailles </LOCATION> where, from April 28 to May 8, visitors can sample wine made as it was during the reign of <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> XVI </PERSON>. For visitors who do n't speak French but would like to know more about exactly what happened 200 years ago, a special historical bus tour in English is being offered by Vision tourist agency. The tours go both to <LOCATION> Versailles </LOCATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION> Royals </ORGANIZATION> lived it, and to sites in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, where they died. Meanwhile, the Tuileries Gardens from May 5 to Nov. 11 will become a living theater of bicentennial events. A special area in the gardens will come alive with musicians, dancers and clowns, while cafes and a restaurant cater to hungry and thirsty crowds. In a theater space visitors will see computer-powered plastic automatons resembling <LOCATION> Robespierre </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Danton </PERSON> and other historical figures doing their revolutionary thing, though beheadings are not part of the show. And spectators may experience a time warp as they view the computerized 3-D film of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> as it was 200 years ago, complete with a riot outside a bakery, the crowds demonstrating against high-priced bread. The gardens will sprout several temporary structures, including two 120-foot towers with spiral staircases to evoke flying doves, the bicentennial symbol. Another theater will offer nonstop, 10-minute skits with actors portraying aspects of the Revolution like `` Fraternity Night.'' This is not a celebration of pledging a college frat, but a show on `` the abolition of privileges.'' Those in <LOCATION> Normandy </LOCATION> at mid-summer will be able to see Tall Ships from all over the world sailing from <LOCATION> Rouen </LOCATION> to <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Havre </PERSON> between July 12-15. As a special salute to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, 51 visiting brass bands from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will parade from City Hall to the Trocadero on July 8. Also in July will be the inauguration of a giant arch west of central <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, a new monument that stands in a line of landmarks beginning at the Place de la Concorde and running through the Arc de Triomphe. The inauguration will kick off events to celebrate the Declaration of the Rights of Man, the <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> adopted during the Revolution and later the preamble to the French Constitution. Festivities will peak on Bastille Day, July 14, beginning with fireworks and including `` the world's biggest ball,'' a huge street dance on the evening of July 13. At the Place de la Bastille, the new <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> Opera will open its doors for the first time, offering a concert commemorating the revolution. The original Bastille prison was burned down two centuries ago, but visitors can see copies of it reconstructed at <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Villette </ORGANIZATION>, a giant park in northeast <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> from July 9-15. At the end of the show, visitors will be allowed to tear down the towers and take home souvenir bricks inscribed, `` Liberte, <LOCATION> Egalite </LOCATION>, Fraternite.'' Meanwhile, toy-makers are offering giant inflatable plastic replicas of the Bastille _ suitable for the backyard. In a more serious vein, President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> will host a summit meeting of the seven richest nations schedueled to take place at the height of the summer celebrations. On July 14, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> and other heads of state are expected to view the parade and flyover from the presidential box on the Champs-Elysees. As a gala wind-up on July 15, a special sound-and-light display created for <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> by <PERSON> Jean-Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Goud </PERSON> will illuminate the City of Lights. The Eiffel Tower, celebrating its own centennial, will present a special illuminated show on July 17. And Mayor <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> has announced that on Aug. 26 tightrope walker <PERSON> Philippe </PERSON> <PERSON> Petit </PERSON> will negotiate the Seine on a 400-foot highwire between the Eiffel Tower and the Palais de Chaillot. <PERSON> Petit </PERSON> will carry a copy of the Declaration of the Rights of Man to present to <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>.

 Just about every museum in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> is putting on an exhibition to mark the bicentennial of the French Revolution.

 The land that was to become the state of <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> was a patchwork of Indian nations and unassigned territory surrounded by a maturing frontier 100 years ago. But that all changed with the roar of a cannon on April 22, 1889, signaling the start of the first of the great land runs that would open millions of acres to white settlement. As many as 40,000 people participated in the Run of'89, each hoping to stake a claim to 160 acres of land or a lot in a designated townsite. The 2-million-acre rectangle later would form parts of six central <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> counties. Re-enactments of the run and related observances are scheduled as part of a statewide centennial this spring. State officials say the focus on the state's frontier heritage should draw an additional 1 million visitors during 1989. Fort Reno west of El <PERSON> Reno </PERSON> will be the site of one of the largest re-enactments. The `` Fort <PERSON> Reno </PERSON> and Indian Territory Days'' observance will draw up to 500 re-enactors in military, civilian and Indian dress to an encampment April 15 and 16, organizers say. After the Fort Reno event, a cavalry unit will spend three days riding 54 miles to <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON>, just as soldiers did in 1889 when they policed crowds gathering for the land run. The largest re-enactments of the run are scheduled as spectator participation events in Guthrie April 22. According to state tourism officials, other centennial re-enactments will be in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> April 8-9; <LOCATION> Lawton </LOCATION> May 20-21; Pawnee and <PERSON> Fort </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> May 27; Yukon June 8-11; Norman July 21-23; <LOCATION> Ponca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> Sept. 16, <LOCATION> Fountainhead </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> Sept. 30; <LOCATION> Salina </LOCATION> Oct. 7; <PERSON> Lawton </PERSON> Oct. 29-30 and in <LOCATION> Oologah </LOCATION> Nov. 11. <PERSON> Whit </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, coordinator of the living history program for the <ORGANIZATION> Oklahoma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tourism </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recreation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, said he hopes participants gain a better understanding of what life was like in 1889 through the re-enactments. `` They can actually feel and touch a little bit of history, whether it's in the foods or the clothing,'' <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said. `` It's a lot more human feeling than reading it out of a book.'' Indian tribes routed from their homelands in other parts of the country had been moved to <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> for decades before the land run. <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> comes from a Choctaw phrase meaning `` Home of the Red People.'' But when many Indians sided with the Confederacy during the Civil War, it gave the federal government the rationale it needed to begin taking land away from the tribes, says <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoig </PERSON>, a retired <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professor who has written 10 books about <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> history. A decade before the Run of'89, railroad interests and so-called `` Boomer'' groups began lobbying <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for the land to be opened for settlement. President <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> used the `` Land Run'' approach apparently because he was familiar with smaller runs used in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hoig </PERSON> says. Homesteaders made the run on foot, on horseback, by wagon and even bicycle. Although it was used four more times to settle <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> land, <PERSON> Hoig </PERSON> says it was a poor system. `` I would say there was very little fair about it,'' <PERSON> Hoig </PERSON> says. `` It was an exercise in American enterprise. Everybody had his own way of beating the game.'' Often, settlers would sneak into the area to be claimed hours or days in advance to scout out desirable land. When the run started, these `` Sooners'' would emerge from the brush to stake their claims before legitimate racers. `` Sooners'' became the nickname for Oklahomans. <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>'s territory days ended in 1907, when it became the 46th state.

 A taste of the Old West awaits the tour group that will travel through what was once <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> territory, meeting tribal elders and sharing their lives for a few days. Led by anthropologist <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Vetter </PERSON>, a select group of about 12 people will learn about Indian values and spirituality, visit Indian sacred sites, and view and participate in tribal pow-wows. The group will explore <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> and take part in the `` sweat lodge,'' an ancient ritual of purification. They also will learn how to set up, take down and travel with teepees.

He says he feels related this way to some of the Indians he has met and worked with. Yet he says he does not try to romanticize Indian life. `` They are a people of the 1990s, as well as a people of the 1860s, with the same inherent faults and virtues as the rest of us.'' Cost is $ 695 per person, covering orientation, registration, lodging, instructions, lectures, activities, some meals and ground transportation.

 The pot of gold may remain elusive. But here, the rainbow is back in the sky. The Rainbow Room of beloved memories _ the first really big date, the celebration of certain wedding anniversaries and birthdays, the one go-for-broke dinner on that vacation in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> _ is operating again, recalling bygone days. As the song says, they've `` put it back the way it was'' _ when it opened in 1934 as the epitome of elegance on the 65th floor of the art deco RCA Building at 30 Rockefeller Center. The Rainbow Room has never been updated but, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Baum </PERSON>, whose company now leases the two floors of the Rainbow complex, says that changes had crept in. `` All of us make little changes. Suddenly they become big changes.'' The Rainbow Room, which has spectacular views of the <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> skyline and a revolving dance floor, reopened in December 1987 after a two-year, $ 20 million renovation. `` It was completely rebuilt down to the steel, every square inch refurbished, put back to be in perfect condition,'' says <PERSON> Baum </PERSON> Renovation became complete this year with the opening of a cozy cabaret named Rainbow and Stars. <PERSON> Baum </PERSON>, who likes to talk about an ambiance of `` dine, dance and romance,'' says that the Rainbow Room now has alternating dance bands and its circular, wooden dance floor revolves again. `` It had n't been used for years,'' he says. What is n't in the Rainbow Room that was at its opening 55 years ago is the `` color organ.'' It shot lights in the colors of the rainbow onto the ceiling's white dome and crystal chandelier, depending on what notes were played, and gave the Rainbow Room its name. The rainbow theme _ updated _ is carried out in <LOCATION> Rainbow </LOCATION> and Stars. The long interior wall is dotted with tiny lights _ the stars. Periodically, the stars disappear and the wall becomes curved rows of rainbow colors. `` I think what we have is what Rainbow stands for,'' says <PERSON> Baum </PERSON>, `` history, memory and the energy of today.'' <PERSON> Baum </PERSON> says, `` The whole idea of Rainbow is again to be showing the world what it means to be a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yorker </LOCATION> and those who want to be New Yorkers for a short time _ how to enjoy seduction and celebration.'' Waving at the view, he adds, `` This is your town expressing all its possibilities. People dress up. We have 30 to 40 percent every night in black tie.'' Rainbow and Stars is on the north side of the RCA Building's 65th floor, and a bar, Rainbow Promenade, is on the south. On the west, where the Ellington Band formerly swung two engagements a year in the Rainbow Grill, the room is renamed <LOCATION> Rainbow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pavilion </LOCATION> and is rented for private parties. The entire floor is a private luncheon club on weekdays. The Rainbow Room is open to the public for brunch on Sundays. <PERSON> Baum </PERSON> says the average food check in the Rainbow Room is around $ 50 for food per person; drinks, tax, tips and a $ 15 music charge take it higher. Dinner prices in <ORGANIZATION> Rainbow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Stars are comparable, with an entertainment charge usually at $ 35 per person.

 When it comes to deciding what to do for a vacation this year, many travel consultants are of the opinion that some 3 million Americans ca n't be wrong. That's the number of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> travelers expected to take cruises in 1989. The choice of itinerary ranges from a 25-cent ride on the <LOCATION> Manhattan-Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> ferry -LRB- round trip -RRB- to a round-the-world trip in a penthouse split-level suite aboard the Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> 2 at $ 360,000 each, double occupancy. For travelers lured by faraway places with strange-sounding names there's a cornucopia of adventurous cruises offered vacationers this season. For example: _ An <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> expedition that includes fishing for piranhas that later become a luncheon treat. _ A visit to the <LOCATION> Galapagos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, described by <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Darwin </PERSON> as `` a living laboratory of evolution,'' where he formulated his `` Origin of Species'' in 1835. _ <LOCATION> Siberian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> cruises led by Sir <PERSON> Fitzroy </PERSON> <PERSON> Maclean </PERSON>, a noted Soviet expert from <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. _ A trip aboard what is billed as the first and only luxury ship to cruise <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Yangtse </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. _ In-depth luxury cruises in the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bothnia </LOCATION>. Despite the millions of cruising Americans each year, travel experts say less than 10 percent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> vacationers have discovered cruising. But because of an expected increase in popularity, more ships are being constructed, according to <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cruise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Passengers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The result is an overcapacity of berths in certain cruising areas, keeping prices modest and competitive for passengers, says <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, author of the <ORGANIZATION> Berlitz </ORGANIZATION> `` Complete Handbook to Cruising.'' Since 85 percent of those who take cruises are eager to go again, he adds, the overcapacity is expected to decline as the margin grows. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON>, professor of marketing at <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION>, agrees with <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> that overcapacity means the cruise industry may not be in for smooth sailing. While cruises are in the midst of an unprecedented boom in popularity, <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON> foresees a change in marketing strategy if that growth _ which averaged 10.5 percent annually from 1980-87 _ is to continue. Plans by the cruise industry to expand by 30,000 berths in the next five years, he says, could result in a classic overcapacity squeeze in profits. Because the market is already so heavily discounted, the <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professor recommends that consumers find a travel agent who specializes in cruises. Bargains exist and more may be in the offing for those who can wait for a last-minute trip, he says, for no cruise line will leave with an empty cabin if possible. <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON> says industries approaching overcapacity typically attempt to segment the market, and he believes that tactic will be used more and more by the cruise industry as capacity exceeds demand. `` That means you'll have ` dinks' -LRB- double income, no kids -RRB- on cruise A, singles on cruise B and retirees on cruise C,'' he says. <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> puts it another way. He notes a trend toward `` specialty'' cruising, using smaller ships equipped to cater to young, active passengers, pursuing their hobbies or special interests. In advising vacationers how to make a selection, <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> says there is a trend by some cruise lines to offer `` more ports'' in a week than their competitors, according to <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>. But such intensive `` island hopping'' gives little time to explore a destination to the full before you have to nip back on board for a quick ride to the next port, he says, adding: `` While you see a lot in a week, by the end of the cruise you may need another week to unwind, and you'll be hard put to remember what you saw on which day. `` Ultimately, this is not the best way to cruise, except for those who want to see as much as possible in a short space of time.'' <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, who has been on more than 600 cruises himself, agrees with the old maxim that `` the best way to unwind quickly is to travel slowly.''

<DATELINE>KILRONAN, Aran Islands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Aran </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> have so many stone walls that only seeing is believing. The three inhabited islands _ <LOCATION> Inishmore </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Inishmaan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Inisheer </LOCATION> _ add up to about 18 square miles, but there must be hundreds of miles of stone walls. They are usually dry walls of mostly sharp stones enclosing tiny pastures and gardens. The walls are the key to the makeup of the <LOCATION> Aran </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, lying across the mouth of the Bay of <LOCATION> Galway </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s west coast. They are islands of limestone, solidified sediment of a tropical sea that covered the area more than 270 million years ago. Documentary filmmaker <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Flaherty </PERSON>, in `` Man of Aran'' -LRB- filmed on Inishmaan in the 1930s -RRB-, showed viewers what seemed the epitome of isolation and struggle against the odds of nature. The islands also inspired playwright <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Millington </PERSON> <PERSON> Synge </PERSON>, author of `` Riders to the Sea'' and `` The Playboy of the Western World,'' when he visited in the 19th century. He made the trip from <LOCATION> Galway </LOCATION> by curragh, the native open Irish canoe made of timber lathes and canvas and rowed by two or more people. Although the islands are only about six miles from <LOCATION> Doolin </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clare </LOCATION>, and some 30 miles from <LOCATION> Galway </LOCATION>, they must have seemed remote indeed. But today, <PERSON> Kilronan </PERSON>, the main village on the biggest island, Inishmore, can seem quite crowded by people looking for the remote. Boats bring day trippers from <LOCATION> Rossaveal </LOCATION>, north of <LOCATION> Galway </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Doolin </PERSON>. Both boat trips are far shorter than the three hours it takes the boat from <LOCATION> Galway </LOCATION>. The bed-and-breakfasts in the <LOCATION> Aran </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> have television, hot water, electricity and radiators in the bedrooms. But the Aran Islands are still a world of their own _ and still remote in their way _ for visitors who spend days rather than hours on them, walking and looking around and listening to the Gaelic language. A horse cart, van or bike will take a visitor to the foot of the hill where stands <PERSON> Dun </PERSON> <PERSON> Aengus </PERSON>, one of the best preserved prehistoric fort-like structures in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The climb to the top has to be done on foot, across a wet, rock-strewn meadow with dainty little flowers and over rocks worn so smooth by nature and so criss-crossed by little crevices that they resemble giant tiles. They are slippery in wet weather _ and chances are it will be misting if not raining there or anywhere else on the <LOCATION> Aran </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. In addition to the stone walls, stone ruins and stone houses, stone crosses dot the landscape, in memory of islanders killed at sea. Fishing is still a major occupation of the islanders and the sea still rules their lives. The man running the tourist office may suddenly shoo away the tourists, close down, and dash to the beach where others, clad in orange rescue suits, are already launching a motorized rescue raft for a boat in trouble under the cliffs of Moher, across the water in <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clare </LOCATION>. As dusk falls on Inishmeer, on a broad sand beach, small boys play with their dogs. The friendly donkeys no longer used for tilling the soil come up to nuzzle a passerby. There are piles of curraghs on the beach, for Inishmeer is the only place in the islands where they're still made. Beyond the beach, on a sweep of dune, are an old burying ground and various ruins dating back to medieval times or even earlier. Up a steep hill, one comes upon a cashel wall -LRB- ancient circular wall that used to enclose ecclesiastical buidings -RRB- and within it a `` more modern'' tower house built, perhaps, in the late 14th century. Alone in the misty twilight, visitors can still feel the remoteness of time and place.

 Americans made 1.2 billion person trips in 1987, according to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. A person trip is travel by one person a distance of 100 miles or more from home. Whether they traveled for business or pleasure, many depended on a travel agent for help. Who are these travel agents? <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, in her 20s, works for the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motorists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> travel agency in <LOCATION> Oberlin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. It's one of 27 association branches throughout the state. Miss <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> headed for the travel business straight out of high school, lured by her love of travel, an interest in geography and the prospect of free or cut-rate trips. A school in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> that offered a six-week crash course plus six months of home study sent her on her way. <PERSON> Kaye </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, a vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Barnett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tours </ORGANIZATION> and Cruises in <LOCATION> Greensboro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, has been in the business more than 25 years. She went into the travel field after trying and discarding nursing and banking. <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Chipman </PERSON>, co-owner of the Encore <PERSON> Preston </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> travel agency in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, was divorced and in her 30s when she went to work about 25 years ago for a friend who owned a travel agency. It was a traditional business for women without specialized training to enter when they wanted something to do after the children were grown, much like real estate, Mrs. <PERSON> Chipman </PERSON> explained in a telephone interview. But computerization has changed all that, she said, and most travel agencies do n't have much time for in-house training these days. To get a job, one needs computer know-how. She also notes that more and more men are entering the field, especially at management level. Both Mrs. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Chipman </PERSON> are certified travel counselors -LRB- CTC -RRB-, meaning they have taken courses offered by the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Certified </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agents </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> ICTA </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, a non-profit organization headquartered in <LOCATION> Wellesley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, devoted to educating travel industry personnel. To earn the initials, an agent must have completed a five-part travel management program, served at least five years in the travel industry and signed a code of ethics. The <ORGANIZATION> ICTA </ORGANIZATION> also has started a new program of training in geographical areas that will allow agents who complete the course to use the desination DS, or destination specialist. A <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> survey for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agents </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> ASTA </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, showed that the gross dollar volume of all bookings handled by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> travel firms in 1987 was $ 64.2 billion. And yet, it seems, there is relatively little formal regulation in the field. A spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> ASTA </ORGANIZATION>'s state <ORGANIZATION> legislative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> department </ORGANIZATION> says only seven states regulate agents and agencies, with the regulations varying state-to-state. The seven are <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. Various organizations within the industry itself, including <ORGANIZATION> ASTA </ORGANIZATION>, have codes of ethics for members. <ORGANIZATION> ASTA </ORGANIZATION>'s covers such things as accuracy of any information an agent gives out, full information to travelers about terms and conditions of any sale, and prompt remittance of any undisputed funds. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is owned by major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines and serves as a clearing house for receipts that agents get from airline tickets they sell. It also sets standards for the agents with which it has agreements _ more than 33,600 of them. If an agency does not live up to its agreement, <ORGANIZATION> ARC </ORGANIZATION> can pull the `` plates'' through which it makes out airline tickets. The <ORGANIZATION> ICTA </ORGANIZATION> quotes estimates that there are about 200,000 travel agents across the country waiting to help travelers. Usually, their services are free. And they say that especially in this day of airline deregulation, agents can save the traveler time and money with their computers, contacts and background. But how many travelers actually follow the advice to `` see your travel agent''? Relatively few, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. It estimates that 13 percent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> travelers consulted an agent in 1987 and of those, only 10 percent used them to book hotel or airline reservations. <ORGANIZATION> ASTA </ORGANIZATION>, however, estimates that almost 90 percent of cruises are booked through travel agencies, and 80 percent of airline travel. But it estimates bookings of hotels through agents only in the mid-20 percent range, with most of that for hotels outside the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

 How can those who want to use a travel agent find a good one? The <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Certified </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agents </ORGANIZATION>, a non-profit organization headquartered in <LOCATION> Wellesley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, and devoted to educating travel industry personnel, offers some advice:. `` First, ask a friend who's had a good experience with an agent.'' It also suggests that one look for the <ORGANIZATION> CTC </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- certified travel counselor -RRB- or DS -LRB- destination specialist -RRB- designations, given by <ORGANIZATION> ICTA </ORGANIZATION> to those who have completed its courses. Also, <ORGANIZATION> ICTA </ORGANIZATION> says, membership of an agency in such trade associations as <ORGANIZATION> ASTA </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agents </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- and <ORGANIZATION> ARTA </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retail </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agents </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- is an indicator of a serious-minded agent. Note, too, how long the agency has been in the field, and how long its staff has been in the business. Beware of rapid turnover. And note whether the office is neat, well-stocked with brochures and well organized, and whether the staff is helpful and friendly.

 <PERSON> Fodor </PERSON>'s, <PERSON> Penguin </PERSON>, `` Let's Go'' and many more _ guidebooks galore from many publishers are showing up in their latest versions. There's a guidebook for every taste in travel. `` Let's Go,'' a series covering <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S.A. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and the rest and written by the <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Student </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agencies </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Martin </LOCATION>'s -RRB-, wo n't list the Hiltons and Marriotts everywhere, but you'll find the hostels and bed-and-breakfasts. And where else can you learn where the hitchhiking is good? Penguin's `` Caribbean,'' `` <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>,'' `` <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'' and `` <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>,'' among others, often written by local journalists and writers, give a feeling of intimacy with a place, as if hearing from a friend. These books are aimed at experienced travelers `` in search of exceptional information to help them sharpen and deepen their enjoyment of the trips they take.'' Readers learn of a pub in <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cork </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, dating back to 1837, where young poets recite their latest works, and that <PERSON> Clare </PERSON> <PERSON> Island </PERSON>, off <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s northwest coast, `` is the kind of sanctuary that attracts individuals; it is remote and yet has every comfort.'' <PERSON> Fodor </PERSON>'s, long familiar to travelers, has started to rewrite, reformat and redesign all its more than 100 travel guides. Did you know, for instance, about the one-room public library at <LOCATION> De </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Funiak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, in northern <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, the state's oldest continuously operating public library, dating from 1887? The new <PERSON> Fodor </PERSON>'s `` <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>,'' in one of numerous paragraphs headed `` Off the Beaten Track,'' notes that this library contains in addition to 14,000 volumes `` an impressive collection of European armor, some dating back to the Crusades.'' Part of the fun of a visit, <ORGANIZATION> Fodor </ORGANIZATION>'s says, is tracing the history of the collection and learning how it got there Bantam Books started a series of travel guides this spring, in both trade size and pocket size. The four larger guides marking the imprint's start cover <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>; the pocket guides are to the cities of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION><LOCATION> , </LOCATION> <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bantam </PERSON> says its intent with the new guides is to get away from the `` laundry list style'' and `` focus only on the unique.'' <ORGANIZATION> Berlitz </ORGANIZATION> has added <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> to its series of handy, pocket-sized travel guides. It contains a number of color photos and maps along with useful travel information on the Czechoslovakian capital. There is a buoyant, unconventional guide to the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>, `` Rum and Reggae, What's Hot and What's Not in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>,'' by <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Runge </PERSON> -LRB- <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Martin </LOCATION>'s -RRB-. It focuses on what the visitor wants to do _ from golf to enjoying a little privacy for nude bathing _ and says where to find it. Just in time to help the traveler already browsing through `` The Best of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'' -LRB- Crown -RRB- or planning a trip elsewhere in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> comes `` The <ORGANIZATION> Travelers </ORGANIZATION>' Guide to <ORGANIZATION> Latin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Manners,'' by <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Devine </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Braganti </PERSON> -LRB- <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Martin </LOCATION>'s -RRB-. Do n't give white flowers if you're invited to someone's home in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, they warn; they're associated with funerals. And in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, it's considered unlucky to give someone handkerchiefs. Some other new guidebooks: `` On the <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION> <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>'' -LRB- Reader's Digest -RRB-, for automobile travelers. This guide is formatted with entries arranged along major highway routes. Each entry has information about routes, sites, opening times, admission costs, and facilities available. `` The Self-Guided Travel Series'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Langenscheidt </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- is for experienced independent travelers. The first of the series covers <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. Each book includes suggested driving and walking tours, concise background about history, architecture, and lesser known sites, and practical information about each location. `` The Real Guides'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Prentice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- is aimed at younger, udget-conscious travelers. These are Americanized versions of the British `` Rough Guides Series'' which include political and cultural information about each country. The first eight books cover <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. `` Eyes of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Travel Guides'' -LRB- Gulf -RRB- are detailed, localized guides for selected areas of the state. `` The Teenager's Guide to Study, Travel and Adventure Abroad'' -LRB- <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Martin </LOCATION>'s -RRB-, compiled by the Council on <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, is a combination of advice and hard listings on educational opportunities all over the world. Details about eligibility, application deadlines, cost, living arrangements, and supervision are covered for each of about 150 entries.

 Whether it means restoring a 10th-century watermill in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, working at a children's crisis center in <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, harvesting crops in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, or digging ditches in <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, a number of young Americans are combining travel with volunteer service, says the Council on <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> CIEE </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-. `` Volunteer workcamps have been popular in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> since the 1920s,'' says <ORGANIZATION> CIEE </ORGANIZATION> program coordinator <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> LeVert </PERSON>, `` but it's a relatively unknown concept for Americans that's growing rapidly. The <ORGANIZATION> CIEE </ORGANIZATION> sponsors an international workcamps program in 14 countries. Typically, the summer workcamps involve 15 to 20 volunteers living in communal fashion, working and sightseeing together. Most participants are 20 to 35 years old, according to <ORGANIZATION> CIEE </ORGANIZATION>, with the minimum age 18. There are limited opportunities for 16-year-olds. Volunteers are responsible for transportation costs to the workcamp and a $ 100 program fee.

 `` Staying on schedule'' is the key to keeping healthy while traveling, says two specialists at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oklahoma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. That means eating, sleeping and bathroom habits, according to Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rankin </PERSON> and Dr. O.H. <PERSON> Rundell </PERSON>. The two have these suggestions for reducing health problems while traveling: _ Stay on your regular schedule when eating. If you get constipated, do n't wait days to do something about it. Snacking on fruits and vegetables will help. _ Restrict your intake of rich foods, to prevent heartburn. _ If your travel keeps you away three or more days, catch up on your sleep before leaving. _ When crossing several time zones, use short-acting sleeping pills to help you sleep. _ Do n't drink to induce sleep on airplane flights. Instead, read a book or listen to music or relaxation tapes. <PERSON> Rankin </PERSON> is associate professor of medicine, <ORGANIZATION> Digestive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diseases </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nutrition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Section </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Memorial </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Rundell </PERSON> is adjunct assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the <ORGANIZATION> OU </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> and director of a sleep disorders center.

 You have a broken leg, and you have a long flight ahead of you. You should have your cast split to prevent buildup of painful air pressure. You're a dieter, on the road. Only calorie-laden menus are presented to you. Be assertive; ask for what you need to maintain your diet. You want to avoid jet lag. You ca n't, but you can learn to handle it. This advice and other ways to travel in good health are covered in a new book, `` Travel Well, A Gourmet Guide to Healthy Travel'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Brontosaurus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, written by a <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> physician, <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaplan </PERSON>, and his wife, <PERSON> Audrey </PERSON>. Travel, the <ORGANIZATION> Kaplans </ORGANIZATION> point out, can be hazardous to your health. Business travel can be stressful. You get less sleep and rest. You eat and drink too much. You do n't exercise enough. `` It is hard enough for people to control their weight, blood pressure, cholesterol level, exercise conditioning, and psychological equilibrium in the relatively stable home situation. On the road, it can be almost impossible,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Kaplans </ORGANIZATION> write. Their book includes advice about how to deal with these problems aloft and on the ground. To help travelers continue exercise and diet regimens, they list hotels with workout, jogging and swimming facilities and restaurants they say will prepare diet fare for you. The Kaplans say there is no proven way to fend off jet lag, but that it will help to try sleeping earlier on eastward flights and staying awake later on westward flights. To avoid stress, they advise planning, traveling light with carry-on luggage, and using special services such as business centers at airports.

 Business travel has become a big ticket item for many corporations, and many of them are learning to manage their own or to cut deals to cut rising travel costs. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corporations are expected to spend over $ 115 billion on travel and entertainment in 1990, up from an estimated $ 95 billion last year, according to an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> survey. A similar survey by <ORGANIZATION> Runzheimer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> puts the median per-company travel expenditure for 1987 at $ 2,348,000, a rise of about $ 120,000 over the previous two years. Travel and entertainment costs are the third largest controllable expense for most companies, after salaries and data processing, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> says. One way companies are dealing with travel expenses is to do it themselves, by adding in-house travel specialists to their staffs. About 29 percent of the 1,600 companies surveyed by <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> say they added travel managers in l988, an increase of 16 percent in two years. Many companies have computerized reservation equipment on their premises. Coupled with frequent reviews and closer enforcement of travel policies, their travel costs continue to rise, but at a rate less than overall average travel costs, according to <ORGANIZATION> Runzheimer </ORGANIZATION>, a travel and living cost consulting company. `` Employers are finally realizing how much they're spending on travel, and they're zeroing in on ways to control this major expense,'' says <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON> <PERSON> Burris </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Runzheimer </ORGANIZATION> publisher. Still, nine out of 10 companies use travel agencies, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> survey shows. Heavy spending companies are able to get lower fares and better services by consolidating the number of agencies they use. About half use a single agency. But even when they use outside agencies, more companies have become more directly involved in travel and entertainment expense management.

 Surviving at the foot of the glass and steel towers of Wall Street, the 200-year-old <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Seaport </LOCATION> has become one of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s most popular new tourist attractions. The restored seaport, with its tall sailing ships, historic buildings and a full schedule of entertainments, attracts an estimated 12 million visitors each year. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s financial empire began in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>'s 18th century warehouses and counting houses, handling the wealth growing out of a burgeoning ship trade. With the opening of the Erie Canal in 1825, produce and goods from the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> fueled the boom, and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> became known as the `` Street of Ships.'' <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> clippers, trans-Atlantic packets, <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> schooners, grain barges, fishing smacks and steamboats crowded the wharves along the lower <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> tip of <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. The heyday lasted until about 1860, when <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> outgrew the port and trade shifted to the <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. Today's Seaport thrives on tourism, its old buildings and sailing ships helping visitors relive the past. They can take harbor excursions aboard vintage ships like the century-old schooner Pioneer, or tour permanently moored ships such as the four-masted bark Peking, the full-rigged three-masted Wavertree, the lightship <PERSON> Ambrose </PERSON> or the fishing schooner <PERSON> Lettie </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, each about 100 years old. The Seaport also is home of the venerable Fulton Fish Market and <PERSON> Sloppy </PERSON> <PERSON> Louie </PERSON>'s, a small shopfront restaurant dating from the 1930s. These have been joined by hundreds of other modern stores, restaurants and boutiques since the Seaport restoration began in the 1970s. <ORGANIZATION> Bowne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> stationers on Water Street is typical of the old buildings in the 11-block restoration. A museum replica of an 1870s print and stationery shop, it has old hand-operated letterpresses producing cards, stationery and pamphlets for sale at the front of the store. The South Street Museum offices are in two Front Street buildings thought to be the oldest on the block, dating from at least 1797. They were once used by grocery firms, and one of the buildings still has a wooden wheel in its attic, part of an old hand-hoisting system. Live indoor and outdoor concerts are regular Seaport events, and fireworks shows are added for holiday weekends. Memorial Day events are scheduled May 27-29; Independence Day, July 1-4; Labor Day, Sept. 2-4. Special events include the Stars and Stripes Regatta in July, the Mayor's Cup Schooner Race in September, and the Maritime Festival in October.

 <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> always has had the image of a `` Fantasy Island'' vacationland. Now, it's trying to fulfill those fantasies, from a wild game safari to Grand Prix-type auto racing. Or, a more romantic, private champagne picnic on a remote cliff overlooking the waterfalls. The new Hyatt Regency <LOCATION> Waikoloa </LOCATION> hotel, which opened last fall at the <LOCATION> Waikoloa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Resort </LOCATION> on the main island, offers 10 different `` fantasies'' for its guests. Some may consider the cost fantastic, as well. The Lauhala Point Picnic is an extra $ 700 per couple; the Hulihee Palace Dinner Fantasy, a private, five-course dinner served along with native entertainment, is $ 300 -LRB- including limo to and from the palace -RRB-. Hotel accommodations run from $ 195 to $ 375 a night. `` The romantic fantasies are popular,'' says <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowell </PERSON>, Hyatt Resorts <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> regional vice president, `` because they allow busy couples a total escape from the real world and the responsibilities of work and family life.'' The $ 360 million hotel seems something of a fantasy itself. It has a fleet of paddle boats plying a four-acre lagoon with tame dolphins and a 77-step, pink flagstone grand staircase descending into the lagoon. Canopied canal boats ferry guests to their rooms. Another top-rated hotel on the island is the <LOCATION> Mauna </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kea </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, on the <LOCATION> Kohala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. It was chosen `` America's No. 1 Favorite Hawaii Resort'' in a poll of subscribers to `` <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Harper </PERSON>'s Hideaway Report,'' a travel newsletter for well-traveled -LRB- and well-heeled -RRB- business executives. The new Hallekulani hotel on <LOCATION> Waikiki </LOCATION> was featured in a recent issue of Travel and Leisure magazine, which considered the capital city of <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> `` still the best urban beach resort in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> Waikiki </LOCATION> beach, the magazine said, `` might be the most famous _ and most expensive _ beach in the world.''

 Here, in one place, you can contemplate 18th-century agricultural life, 19th-century industry, and 20th-century music. <LOCATION> Waterloo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> is a restored rural village with buildings spanning two centuries, offering the visitor a visible historic time chart. Houses and outbuildings in rusticated stones from the 1740s show how the homesteaders who settled here along the banks of the <LOCATION> Musconetcong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> milled grain by water power and worked their trades as weavers, tavern keepers, blacksmiths, apothecaries and the like. Iron was found in the region, and by the time of the Revolutionary War, <LOCATION> Andover </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Forge </LOCATION> in the village was producing gun barrels for the <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. In 1815, Brig Gen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, an early landowner, renamed the community to celebrate <LOCATION> Wellington </LOCATION>'s victory over <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> at <LOCATION> Waterloo </LOCATION> that year The opening of the 102-mile <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canal </ORGANIZATION> in the 1830s marked the next era, with <LOCATION> Waterloo </LOCATION> serving as an inland port for barges transporting coal, iron and grain from <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. The barges have gone now, but the towpaths remain for walking through forests, along lakes and rivers. Tall Victorian mansion houses also remain as a legacy of <LOCATION> Waterloo </LOCATION>'s mid-19th century prosperity. <LOCATION> Waterloo </LOCATION> declined with the coming of the railroads after the 1840s and nearly disappeared after the market crash in 1929. But the abandoned village was discovered by <PERSON> Percival </PERSON> <PERSON> Leach </PERSON> and <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Gualandi </PERSON> in the 1940s, and they began its restoration. The two men, partners in a design firm, solicited money for restoration and antiques for the 11,000-acre property, turning it into a historical museum now owned jointly by the state and the non-profit <ORGANIZATION> Waterloo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. Music festivals are the 20th-century contribution to <LOCATION> Waterloo </LOCATION>. Its summer concert series began 20 years ago, and since then both classic and popular artists have entertained more than 250,000 visitors each year.

 <LOCATION> Hilton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Head </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> _ that's <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> _ promotes itself with the simple motto: `` Life is simply better here.'' No relation to the Hilton hotels, the island is 35 miles from <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, 95 miles from <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, and for better educated, beach-loving pleasure-seekers with money, it may indeed be a simply better place to visit.

More than 380,000 travelers are expected this spring, between March and May, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>.

There are eight planned communities on the island today, with a population of more than 20,000 people. A four-lane highway bridge connects the island to the mainland.

 Being with the family is the primary reason most Americans go on vacation, according to an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> survey. The survey of 1,000 adults found that 72 percent of those asked put family as the biggest motivation in taking a vacation, especially among women and among those over 65. It was followed by being with a spouse or companion, then rest and relaxation and escape from stress. Rest and relaxation was the biggest reason among travelers aged 18 through 49. Fifty-eight percent said they went on vacation for fun and entertainment and 56 percent wanted to `` go somewhere new.'' Men ranked romance higher than women did; 38 percent of the men said it was an important factor, compared to 32 percent of the women. The survey, called `` Psychology of Vacation Travel,'' also found that the average American vacationer takes a day-and-a-half to `` unwind,'' although nearly 10 percent said they never unwind. The vacation `` afterglow'' lasts six days, on the average, according to those interviewed. But 9 percent said it lasts less than a day. Others reasons cited for vacations included adventure, meeting new people, `` escape'' -LRB- from everyone, everything or the weather -RRB-, shopping and gambling.

 Inflation has been heating up in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> for the first time in years and that, plus the higher interest rates being used to combat it, are causing a lot of worry across the Continent. But few economists believe <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> will return to double-digit inflation or that it will threaten the European economies' comeback of the late 1980s. The pickup in prices, which coincides with a resurgence in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> inflation, is being blamed on faster-than-expected economic growth, which caught European governments by surprise. Central banks across <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, it turned out, slackened their grip too much after the October 1987 stock market crash, economists said. Both consumer buying and investment spending have been strong in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and as a result, factories have been working at or near capacity. Economists also blame the upward trend in the dollar and the weakness of <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> currencies _ particularly the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> mark _ last year, as well as higher commodity prices, especially for oil. Higher prices are being exacerbated by higher wage claims, threatening to cause wage-price spirals in some countries. Since the second half of 1988, European countries have tried to stop inflation by raising interest rates to discourage that spending and borrowing, but there is no clear indication it is working. Signs are that consumers are continuing to spend. In <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, for example, retail sales spurted 2.5 percent in February. This renewed inflation is a big disappointment for <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> following the great successes the once-lumbering and mature economies have had in turning themselves around by making their industries more modern and efficient. `` There are inflationary pressures within most of the economies in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. I think the inflation fear is fairly widespread,'' said <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rendell </PERSON>, an economist at the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> investment firm <ORGANIZATION> James </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. European inflation will peak at 5 percent this year, its highest level since 1985, up from with 3.5 percent last year, he predicted It should fall back to 4 percent next year, as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic growth slows and the dollar weakens, he said. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> are expected to fare the worst, with an average annual rate of up to 7 percent in 1989, economists say. The continental economies are not as overheated as those of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, an economist with the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Kleinwort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grieveson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>. As a result, inflation is `` a much easier problem for them to contend with,'' he said Indeed, <PERSON> Rendell </PERSON> said: `` It's important to stress that although we're going to get back to inflation, we're not going to get back to the teen-age -LRB- double-digit -RRB- inflation we saw in the 1970s or the double-digit inflation we saw earlier in the 1980s.'' Many economists think interest rates will have to go even higher, particularly after the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government reported Friday that wholesale prices surged 1 percent in February, prompting the stock markets to plunge. The rates might go up within the month, they said. But <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowers </PERSON>, an economist at <ORGANIZATION> Barclays </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zoete </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wedd </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, said he is not convinced higher interest rates will work in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, for example, because Spanish consumers are n't heavily indebted and because a large amount of investment is foreign and funded from the outside. In addition, these high rates, besides squeezing mortgage holders and other borrowers, are boosting currencies, and that is worsening trade imbalances in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. However, economists are not concerned that the higher interest rates will lead to a recession. `` In <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, there is a lot of -LRB- economic -RRB- momentum,'' <PERSON> Rendell </PERSON> said. `` We see -LRB- economic -RRB- growth at relatively high levels. It will be less than last year, but it still will be pretty strong.'' <PERSON> Rendell </PERSON> expects economic growth of 3 percent in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> this year compared with 4 percent in 1988. Here are annual inflation rates for 1988, and forecasts for 1989 and 1990 for the major <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> countries. They were provided by <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Capel </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> _ <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, 1.2 percent, 2.9 percent, 2 percent _ <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, 2.7 percent, 3.2 percent, 2 percent _ <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, 4.9 percent 7.1 percent, 4.5 percent _ <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, 5 percent, 6.5 percent, 6 percent _ <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, 4.9 percent,

<TEXT>
 A multimillion dollar agreement to import <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s diamonds announced this month by New York-based <ORGANIZATION> Lazare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kaplan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> could translate into more than just much-needed hard currency to the war-ravaged southern African nation. Under terms negotiated with <ORGANIZATION> Endiama </ORGANIZATION>, the Angolan state diamond company, <PERSON> Lazare </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaplan </PERSON> will import $ 20 million a year in high-quality, uncut gem diamonds for processing at its plant in <LOCATION> Caguas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, company spokeswoman <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiener </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wiener </PERSON> said the first shipment has arrived for cutting and polishing in the plant. The agreement is the first major international business deal announced with the Marxist-oriented government since the signature Dec. 22 of U.S.-brokered accords by <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> on the phased withdrawal of 50,000 Cuban troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. The withdrawal is being made in return for the independence of the South African-controlled territory of <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, formerly known as <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` I was impressed by the fact that all those with whom we met in <LOCATION> Luanda </LOCATION> took a business-like, non-ideological approach,'' <ORGANIZATION> LKI </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Tempelsman </PERSON> said in a company news release. `` In view of the close diplomatic cooperation between the American and Angolan authorities in connection with the withdrawal of South African and Cuban forces from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, there is no reason why this agreement should not be followed by many mutually beneficial examples of economic cooperation between our two countries.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has no diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, which gained independence from <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> in 1975 after a 14-year colonial war and has since been fighting U.S.-and South African-backed rebels. Ms. <PERSON> Wiener </PERSON> said the diamond importing agreement, the first LKI has made with <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, was indirectly related to the December accords. `` The peace process was moving forward, and continues to move forward,'' she said. `` It can only help business, and we're encouraged by it. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> agreed to stop supporting <PERSON> Jonas </PERSON> <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> and his <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> for the Total Independence of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, but the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> continues to supply about $ 15 million a year in military aid through bases in neighboring <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>. Before his inauguration, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wrote <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> assuring him of continued <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support in order to pressure Angolan President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> into negotiating. Nearly 90 percent of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s hard currency earnings come from oil pumped mainly by an Angolan-American consortium in fields near the mouth of the <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. Under Portuguese rule, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> was exporting between 5 percent and 8 percent of the world's diamond production. Exports fell following independence but rose in 1981-82 to 1.3 million carats worth $ 165 million. In 1987 the <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> company SPE -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Portuguese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entrepreneurial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- signed a cooperation agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Endiama </ORGANIZATION>, and 50 Portuguese technicians are working in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> as diamond mining advisers. A delegation from <ORGANIZATION> Endiama </ORGANIZATION> visited <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION> earlier this month following a trip to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and there have been newspaper reports here of a possible joint venture between <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> in mining and finishing. Throughout the 1980s <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> has been an illicit export route for unfinished Angolan diamonds. The <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION> daily <PERSON> Europeu </PERSON> said the illicit trade amounted to $ 200 million in 1983 alone. In 1984, Savimbi-led rebels attacked diamond mines in northeastern <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, and production fell off sharply. The area was later divided into production blocs and leased to mining companies in the same way <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> has awarded concessions to oil companies. The Angolan army now provides security in the diamond-mining areas. Ms. <PERSON> Wiener </PERSON> said LKI does not plan to become involved in actual diamond mining in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>.

 Companies ranging from breweries to <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T now view the `` The World's Most Famous Beach'' through green-tinted glasses. Instead of seeing a half-million tanned and sunburned college students in town to party until they drop, they see dollar signs. Students spend big bucks on their annual excursion to the sand, surf and bars of <LOCATION> Daytona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, a fact increasingly recognized by both big and small entrepreneurs. During the five-week period betwen March 4 and April 1 this year, an estimated $ 100 million will be spent by spring breakers here for everything from hotels, to food, to beer, according to <PERSON> Evelyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Fine </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Mid-Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Daytona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. Since Fort Lauderdale cracked down on the merry making in that sun capital a few years ago, <LOCATION> Daytona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> has become a haven for college students nationwide. `` We're the biggest spring break destination in the world,'' Ms. <PERSON> Fine </PERSON> said. `` <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> bitterly regrets losing the spring break market.'' If the college students are here, can businesses which cater to that age group be far behind? Playboy magazine, which featured `` The Women of Spring Break'' in its April issue, is one company with an active beach presence. `` Playboy is here because we're No. 1 in the college market. It's a great party,'' said <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakowitz </PERSON>, a communications director for <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> `` The majority of our readers are in the 18 - to 34-year-old range and that's the market that's here. On the pool deck of <PERSON> Penrod </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Clarendon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plaza </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION>, a long line of young men waited for bikini-clad <PERSON> Lynne </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON>, Miss July 1986, and <PERSON> Ava </PERSON> <PERSON> Fabian </PERSON>, Miss August 1986, to autograph pictures. `` I am in love,'' screamed a somewhat inebriated young man, holding his autographed photos. The two signed such things as `` My No. 1 sweetheart,'' and `` Love and Kisses'' on the black and white publicity photographs. Playboy also gave the young men a plastic bag containing a variety of cologne samples, sunscreen, and condoms _ all products advertised in the men's magazine. Also in the bag was <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION>'s Spring Break magazine. `` I read about <LOCATION> Daytona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> in <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION>,'' said senior <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Brewer </PERSON>, a chemical engineering major from <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, who added that in past years that he had spent spring break on <LOCATION> Padre </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. While Playboy was using sex to push its products, <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T was trying to appeal to students' minds. For students trying to get away from the studying rat race, a 10,000-square-foot, open-air, seven-foot-high plastic and maze was constructed on the beach. Known as the <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T Maze Challenges, students were encouraged to use their wits and legs to try to make it through the maze in record time. Each day, the maze's pathways, which contain <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T advertising posters, are reconstructed into a different configuration, giving students a chance to try several different mazes. `` We estimate, on the average, it will take people between 15 and 20 minutes to complete the maze,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Pugliese </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> college market manager, who said those that complete the maze in record time receive T-shirts, beach towels and duffel bags. `` Lots of people are vying for the attention of the college students, and I feel this is a healthy and positive event as compared to some of the things spring break is known for,'' explained <PERSON> Gail </PERSON> <PERSON> Piccirilli </PERSON>, in charge of the college marketing for <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Basking </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, as she led a reporter through the maze.

 Share prices plunged today in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> for their sharpest one-day decline this year, and the dollar gained against the Japanese yen. The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, a 77.01-point loser Friday, shed another 366.21 points, or 1.14 percent, to finish trading at 31,654.80. The index's decline marked the largest one-day drop this year in a trading session dominated by sell orders following a sharp fall at the start of today's session. Volume traded on the first section today was estimated at 950 million shares, compared with Friday's 1.18 billion shares. `` Share prices were lower across the board,'' said <PERSON> Manji </PERSON> <PERSON> Ueda </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s largest brokerage. He attributed the index's plunge to a 50-point decline in the Dow Jones Industrial Average in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Friday and the trend toward a weaker yen. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> index fell sharply following a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government report Friday that the nation's producer price index of finished goods rose a full percentage point in February, triggering concern that inflation will grow and interest rates will rise. Instability on the foreign exchange market and higher interest rates tend to discourage market participants from investing in stock, while higher <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates would make the dollar more attractive to foreign currency investors. `` The majority of Japanese investors collected profits by selling off risky issues after they were discouraged by the decline on the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> market and the yen's weakness,'' <PERSON> Ueda </PERSON> said. `` A national holiday -LRB- Tuesday -RRB- also prompted them to sell off,'' he said. Financial markets will be closed in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> on Tuesday, a national holiday marking the spring equinox. In currency dealings, the dollar gained ground and finished trading at 131.92 yen, up 0.85 yen from Friday's 131.07-yen close. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency opened at 131.88 yen and fluctuated in a range between 131.79 yen and 132.08 yen. The 1 percent rise in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> producer price index of finished goods in February triggered a new wave of worries about inflation and interest rate hikes, said a trader with <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity. The dollar fluctuated in a fairly tight range in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> mainly because of position adjustments, the trader said. `` Speculative investors sold the dollar for profit-taking around the 132-yen level, while they bought it near 131.70 yen,'' he said. `` The <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> market's dollar-buying interest is still strong, and investors are now concerned about the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consumer price index in February, due out Tuesday,'' the trader said. He said a higher consumer price index would further encourage investors to buy the dollar and boost its value against the yen.

 This <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General-Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> poll on savings and loans is based on telephone interviews March 6-15 with 1,108 adults in the continental <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Phone numbers were selected randomly, and interviews were conducted with the adult who had the most recent birthday. The results were weighted to adjust for variations in the sample. The poll has a three-point margin of error, meaning that if every adult American were asked the same questions, the results theoretically would be the within three points of the poll's results, 19 times out of 20 The error margin is larger for subgroups _ five points, for example, for those with savings and loan accounts. There are other sources of potential error in polls, including the wording and order of questions. These are the questions and results in this poll; because of rounding, sums may not total 100. 1. Let's consider a few different kinds of places where people can put their savings: banks, <ORGANIZATION> savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; loan associations, credit unions and money market funds. Please tell me whether you think of each as a safe place to keep your money, or not. a. Banks: Safe: 93 percent. Unsafe: 5. Do n't know or no answer: 2. b. S & amp; Ls: Safe: 53 Unsafe: 36.

<HEAD>Jury Still Deadlocked After Nine Days In Stock Manipulation Case</HEAD>

 A federal jury reported an 11-1 deadlock but decided to continue deliberating as the possibility of a second mistrial emerged in the watershed <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> stock manipulation case. On the ninth day of deliberations Sunday, the jury in the first criminal trial linked to the confessions of <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> reheard more of two hours of testimony but gave no indication it was closer to breaking the impasse. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> told the panel of nine women and three men to reconsider the evidence after the panel reported the split Saturday. The sole juror said he or she could shift positions `` under no circumstances.'' The jury was sequestered March 10 after a six-week retrial. Attorneys for both sides declined to comment Sunday on the protracted deliberations. The case in federal court in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> is considered a key test of the government's ability to try Wall Street corruption emanating from the insider trading scandals of the mid-1980s. It is the first securities fraud case to reach the trial stage. <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> and its vice chairman, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherwin </PERSON>, have denied charges of trying to boost the price of <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> stock in October 1986 in an attempt to reap gains from the planned sale of a large block of shares. They are charged with eight counts including stock manipulation, conspiracy, wire fraud and securities fraud. The jury, in a note read in court Saturday, asked the judge for help in resolving the deadlock but did not say whether the majority favored acquittal or conviction. The move came after more than 65 hours of deliberations. `` Your honor. We need help. There are 11 jurors who have come to a unanimous decision on counts one through eight and one juror who does not agree,'' the jury said. <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> said that before declaring a mistrial because of the deadlock, she wanted the jurors to reassess their positions. But she said jurors should not vote against their conscience just because they were outnumbered. <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> called a mistrial Jan. 10 after ruling the prosecution unintentionally withheld from the defense a piece of evidence that showed a key document had been altered. An acquittal would be a major setback for the <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office, which chose <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> as its leadoff case in a series of securities fraud trials set for this year. Prosecutors based the <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> case on information supplied by <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferies </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> broker who was fingered by <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> in late 1986 and testify under an agreement with the government. He already has agreed to plead guilty to two felony counts for breaking securities laws. <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, a former arbitrager, is serving a three-year term for insider trading charges under a settlement in which he also paid $ 100 million in fines and restitution. <PERSON> Jefferies </PERSON>' testimony is considered central to the Boesky-derived trials of speculator <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> and takeover specialist <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Bilzerian </PERSON> later this year. Attorneys for those two defendants have been attending the <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> trial. During deliberations, the jury asked to rehear testimony of Jefferies and several other witnesses, as well as review charts, tables and other documents presented during the six-week trial. <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION>, a <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON>, N.J.-based chemical and building materials manufacturer, and two subsidiaries face a maximum total fine of $ 12 million. <PERSON> Sherwin </PERSON>, 55, of <LOCATION> Princeton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, faces 40 years in prison and a fine of up to $ 2 million.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>

 Share prices were lower at midday Monday in patchy trading, as the market attempted to regain its footing after Friday's near 40-point slide. The market was `` nervous and sensitive,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>, joint head of market making at the brokerage firm <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON> and Co.. An early morning consolidation attempt faltered when several market makers marked down their stocks and became reluctant to add stock onto their books, <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> said However, market watchers cautioned that the low volume appeared to magnify the drop in prices. `` There's been vast movement on no real trade,'' one said. Market players also were cautious ahead of Wall Street's opening. They were worried about a continuation of Friday's sell-off in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average declined nearly 50 points. At about noon in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times-Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> 100-share index was off 18.3 points, or 0.9 percent, at 2,054.8, above the midmorning low of 2,052.9, but well down from the opening best level of 2,075.0. Volume amounted to 221.8 million shares by midday compared with 267.1 million shares at the same time Friday.

 Stock prices declined broadly today, still feeling the weight of the new inflation worries that hit the market on Friday. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 15.35 to 2,276.79 in the first half hour of trading. Losers outnumbered gainers by more than 3 to 1 in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 224 up, 710 down and 457 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 22.11 million shares as of 10 a.m. on Wall Street. Friday's news that the producer price index of finished goods rose a full percentage point in February for the second consecutive month caught many traders by surprise. Interest rates jumped as investors quickly concluded that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> was likely to tighten credit further in its efforts to keep inflation in check.

 Traders went back to work in the stock and bond markets today worried about the economic outlook and wondering, `` Is history going to repeat itself?'' A repeat of history would mean a precipitous drop in prices _ another crash like Black Monday, Oct. 19, 1987. The financial markets have been nervous for months about inflation and the prospect that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> would continue to drive interest rates higher to curb prices and cool off the economy. But concerns about how the economy could affect stock and bond prices became full-fledged anxiety on Friday, after the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported inflation at the wholesale level soared 1 percent for the second month in a row in February. The news unleashed a storm of selling in the stock and credit markets. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks fell more than 48 points, and the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s closely watched 30-year bond fell more than $ 17 for each $ 1,000 in face amount. That meant higher interest rates. Bond traders were so upset by the inflation report they totally disregarded the strength of the dollar Friday. In many sessions in the past, the credit markets shrugged off negative economic signals because the dollar moved higher. Traders did n't care about the dollar _ all they saw was interest rate hikes in the offing. Friday's market trends continued today as stocks slumped and interest rates and the dollar rose. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks was off 12.50 points at 2,279.64 as of 11 a.m. EST. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s long bond was off another $ 1.50 per $ 1,000 face value, as its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to an even 9.3 percent. The dollar was slightly up against the Japanese yen, West German mark and British pound. To some observers, Friday's performance bore a disquieting resemblance to Oct. 16, 1987, also a Friday. That day, the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average lost 108 points in a precursor to its 508-point collapse three days later on Black Monday. Could it happen again? `` A crash-type situation is conceivable,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Brusca </PERSON>, chief economist with <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, noting that `` Overseas, things do n't look any better.'' `` <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has a currency that's falling and an economy that's runing at a high rate of speed,'' he said The Japanese face high inflation because they are heavily dependent on oil imports, and the price of oil keeps climbing, <PERSON> Brusca </PERSON> said. European nations face similar problems, he said. But <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON>, manager of global and fixed income and economic research for <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION>, discounted the possibility of a repeat of October 1987. `` There is one difference,'' <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> said. `` Before the crash, the dollar was heading south ... The dollar has been firming the last several days.'' `` You do n't have the same lack of confidence you had at that time,'' said Stone. `` You had a bad -LRB- inflation -RRB- number, but there's no fear of a collaspe of the currency. `` I would n't go too far in making a comparison,'' he said. Economic fundamentals aside, there is little chance of such a steep decline in stock prices as on Oct. 19, 1987 because safeguards have been implemented as a result of the crash. On Friday, some of those safeguards were deployed. Price limits on stock-index futures trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> _ known as circuit-breakers _ were used for the first time since being imposed last year by major financial markets. Many critics blamed the effect of computerized strategies involving simultaneous trading of stocks and the stock-index futures for worsening the crash, leading to the development of the circuit-breakers, which also provide for a temporary halt in stock market trading if the Dow Jones average falls 250 points in one day. Even with safeguards in place, <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> doubted there would be much movement in the markets Monday because of the impending release of another inflation indicator, the Consumer Price Index for February, on Tuesday. `` I think there's going to be a lot of reluctance to make a major commitment until CPI,'' he said. The consensus among economists was for a 0.5 percent increase in consumer prices. `` If the consensus' expectation is realized, it could take some of the steam out of the ugly number we got'' on Friday, <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> said. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, director of money market research for <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said it would take more than just a few good economic reports to turn the markets around. `` There is almost a sense of despair in the marketplace regarding the outlook for interest rates,'' he said. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said he expected the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> would tighten credit further. `` It's highly improbable for any chance of a drop in interest rates in the next few months.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> increased its discount rate _ the interest it charges its member banks _ half a percentage point to 7 percent almost four weeks ago. But <PERSON> Brusca </PERSON>, of <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> is faced with a really terrible dilemma _ if the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> were to tighten any quicker, what would it do to the dollar, which is already stronger than it should be?'' When <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates go up, the dollar becomes more attractive to foreign investors and also rises. But when the dollar is too high, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit increases _ so a surge in interest rates could widen the trade gap. The trade deficit was cited as one of the factors contributing to the 1987 crash.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today cleared the way for the partial merger of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>'s two daily newspapers. The court, over two dissenting votes, set aside an earlier postponement that had been granted by Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>. A federal appeals court panel here voted 2-1 last Jan. 27 to uphold then-Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s decision to allow the newspapers to form a joint operating agreement under the federal Newspaper Preservation Act. The 1970 law empowers the attorney general to give financially failing newspapers an exemption from antitrust laws. Under the joint operating agreement, the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> and The Detroit News would combine their business, advertising and production departments but maintain separate news and editorial staffs. By a 5-4 vote last month, the full appeals court refused to reconsider the three-judge panel's January ruling. <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, in a three-paragraph order March 4 postponing the merger, said he was referring the matter to the full court. A group of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> readers and advertisers who sued to stop the partial merger contend that the <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, a morning newspaper owned by <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, is not a failing newspaper even though it lost $ 10 milion a year between 1981 and 1986. The opponents, calling themselves <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Citizens for an <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, say the Free Press and News, which lost $ 50 million in the same period, were unprofitable solely because both papers cut prices in an unsuccessful effort to force each other out of business. <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which owns the News, is the nation's largest newspaper publishing group. <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> is the second largest. <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> has threatened to close down the Free Press if the joint operating agreement is not approved. The opponents' emergency request said the agreement `` threatens the independence of daily newspapers in 25 cities'' where, like <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, competing newspapers still exist. Justices <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> voted to extend the postponment until the court considers a formal appeal by those who oppose the partial merger. `` Finally, we seem to be near the point where we can assure the readers of the Free Press that their newspaper is saved,'' said Free Press Publisher <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>. In other action today, the court: _ Agreed to decide whether there is a constitutional right to take the hullocinogenic drug peyote as a religious practice. The court agreed to review a ruling that <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> officials violated religious freedom by denying unemployment compensation to two men fired for using peyote at religious ceremonies. _ Agreed to use a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> case to decide whether federal courts may make it easier to broaden age discrimination lawsuits against employers. The court said it will hear an appeal by <ORGANIZATION> Hoffmann-La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which is accused of bias against older workers in laying off some 1,200 employees at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> plants. _ Turned away an appeal by 10 people criminally convicted for their participation in a 1985 protest demonstration at a <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> abortion clinic. _ Let stand rulings that 1985 articles in Hustler magazine villifying two women active in fighting pornography are constiutionally protected expressions of opinion. The two women lost their attempts to revive libel lawsuits against Hustler magazine and its publisher, <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynt </PERSON>. _ Left intact rulings that the requirement of a Florida-based company that all its employees attend weekly Christian devotional services violated the rights of an atheist who worked there.

 Stock prices suffered another broad setback today, still feeling the pressure of the new inflation worries that hit the market on Friday. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 48.57 points Friday, dropped 23.21 to 2,268.93 by noontime on Wall Street. Losers outnumbered gainers by nearly 3 to 1 in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 338 up, 972 down and 479 unchanged. Friday's news that the producer price index of finished goods rose a full percentage point in February for the second consecutive month caught many traders by surprise. Interest rates jumped as investors quickly concluded that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> was likely to tighten credit further in its efforts to keep inflation in check. Rates were mostly higher again today in the credit markets. More evidence of trouble is expected on Tuesday when the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reports on the consumer price index for last month. Fears have increased on the Street that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> might wind up pushing the economy to the brink of a recession before it sees any signs that its anti-inflation campaign is working. <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> led the active list, down 3 -LRB- at 109 -RRB- on top of a 5 | - point drop Friday, when the company said its first-quarter earnings would fall short of analysts Other losers among the blue chips included <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION>, down | at 4ng Sunday to get the craft ready for its ride atop a jumbo jet to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. Officials, however, expected it to leave on time Friday. After their desert landing at Edwards early Saturday, the five astronauts spent the rest of the weekend with their families. They were going back to work today, briefing the space agency on the shuttle's performance and the experiments conducted during the nearly flawless five-day mission, said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Nesbitt </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. A preliminary examination indicated only 10 thermal protection tiles will need to be replaced, in contrast to the last shuttle flight, in December, when nearly 200 tiles were severely damaged. `` This is one of the best yet,'' said <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lodge </PERSON>, who works on the shuttle's tile system. `` We've had no major damages, there's a few dings ... around the nose cap, nothing severe at all.'' The tiles shield orbiters during the fiery re-entry into Earth's atmosphere Five tiles were damaged when wires connected to a tire pressure monitor snapped as the right main landing gear dropped, Ms. <PERSON> Lodge </PERSON> said. Only one of those five tiles will need to be replaced, she said. The brakes, which have caused problems during previous shuttle landings, also performed well, engineers said. `` The brakes looked the best ever. No signs of any heat; there was no damage whatsoever,'' said <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s Tip Talone, who coordinates processing of the orbiter for each flight. The mission ended with a picture-perfect landing that was watched by a near-record crowd of 460,000. Five hundred people cheered the astronauts' return to <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> later in the afternoon. `` We've had one fun time and we really enjoyed this flight,'' said mission specialist <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchli </PERSON>, who had been on two previous Discovery missions. The flight was commanded by <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Coats </PERSON>, who had flown one previous shuttle mission. The other crew members _ pilot <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blaha </PERSON> and mission specialists <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Springer </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bagian </PERSON> _ made their first voyages. Discovery's flight, the 28th shuttle mission, was the third since Challenger exploded shortly after liftoff on Jan. 28, 1986. Seven astronauts died in the explosion, which brought shuttle flights to a halt for nearly three years. Discovery blasted off from <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, a week ago today. Six hours into the mission, the crew accomplished its primary mission _ the deployment of a $ 100 million communications satellite. The satellite completes a network that will enable the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> to have nearly constant contact with space shuttles and other satellites. The astronauts also photographed the Earth. Their film will be edited into a movie that will document environmental damage by man and nature. Four rats that were aboard as one of the experiments, were killed shortly after touchdown so researchers can study how their intentionally cut legs healed in microgravity. Many of the 32 fertilized chicken eggs that were aboard will be allowed to hatch to see how space affected embryo development. Other experiments included growing protein crystals as part of a project to develop new drugs and seeing how plants grow in microgravity. The results will be studied by the researchers who designed the experiments. The only problem during the flight concerned an erratic pressure reading from a hydrogen tank that helps supply electricity to the orbiter. The astronauts conserved electricity for a day until ground controllers corrected the difficulty. The next shuttle to fly _ <LOCATION> Atlantis </LOCATION> _ is expected to be rolled out to a <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION> launch pad Wednesday for its scheduled April 28 liftoff. The Atlantis astronauts will deploy a probe that will map the surface of <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Continental Attendants Strike; No Immediate Effect Seen</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Rewrites throughout to UPDATE with Trump lowering offer for
shuttle; adding background on flight attendants union and tightening throughout.
No pickup.</HEAD>

 <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> flight attendants announced a strike today and began picketing at airports, but no immediate effects on flights were reported at strikebound Eastern's sister carrier. `` I can only confirm that the strike has been called,'' <PERSON> Myra </PERSON> <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the Union of Flight Attendants, said today in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. She said the decision was made among union leaders Sunday night, but it was not directly related to the strike that has all but shut down <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> since March 4. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> said today he is no longer willing to pay his prior offer, $ 365 million, for Eastern's profitable <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> shuttle, because of the labor troubles at <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>'s sister airline. And Eastern began efforts to hire new pilots to replace the ones who have walked out. As the <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> strike deadline came at 10 a.m. EST, some flight attendants set up picket lines at the carrier's main <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> hub, but flights appeared to be departing and arriving normally. There are about 6,800 <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> flight attendants; the company and union give differing figures on how many are union members in the largely ununionized carrier. `` It's like an annual event,'' <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Messing </PERSON> said. An Easter 1988 call for a sickout failed to materialize, and `` there's no reason to believe this attempt will be any more successful,'' he said. About 10 members of the <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Attendants </ORGANIZATION>, dressed in maroon uniforms with <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> emblems, walked a picket line at <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Intercontinental </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, carrying yellow signs proclaiming `` On Strike.'' `` We were prepared to strike in December and we were promised at the time that if we waited the company would be willing to sit down and negotiate a contract with us in January, but that still has not happened,'' <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON>, one of the pickets, said. There were also pickets reported at <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> -RRB- <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Stapleton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION>, two other major <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> airports. It was not immediately clear how many flight attendants walked off their jobs and how many were picketing on their days off. There were no immediate reports of problems at airports affected by the picketing, or at other airports. Many airports require would-be pickets to seek permission in advance. `` We do n't see any evidence of that at this point,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boulware </PERSON>, public affairs director for <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Stapleton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION>. `` We have not received any requests for permission to demonstrate or picket by the flight attendants.'' <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement that the flights were running normally, `` which shows that our flight attendants are proud of their service and will continue to support the company's goal of providing for the customer.'' The company says that only about 5 percent of its flight attendants are actually dues-paying members of the attendants union, which is the only union at the airline since 1983. The union says that more than 60 percent of the attendants are members. <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>'s flight attendants voted in December to authorize a strike over wages and have been free to walk out since that time, union president <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Winkler </PERSON> said Sunday. Messing said the company had reserve attendants it could call in if the walkout became significant. He said <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> operates about 1,400 flights daily serving 120 cities in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and numerous foreign countries. <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>'s flight attendants, although represented by a union, have been operating without a collective bargaining agreement since September 1983, when <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> into bankruptcy and abrogated his union contracts. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> is the parent company of both <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Winkler </PERSON> said she hoped a <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> walkout would make it clear to travelers and government officials that `` the problem with <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> is n't just at Eastern.'' Eastern, meanwhile, announced this weekend a campaign to hire pilots to replace those who have refused to cross the picket lines. The union for the 3,600 pilots who have honored the Machinists' strike since it began March 4 said it will go to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to fight the plan The airline filed for protectio under the bankruptcy laws five days after the strike began. `` All transactions outside the normal course of business need -LRB- the judge's -RRB- approval,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Linsey </PERSON>. `` Hiring a new work force is certainly not in the normal course of business.'' Only about 200 <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> pilots, most of them management, are flying, and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> is operating less than 10 percent of its pre-strike schedule of 1,040 daily flights. Most of the still-operating flights are on the shuttle service between <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, which <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> has been trying to sell to <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>. In a letter to <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> disclosed today, <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> said he would n't pay $ 365 million for the shuttle because it `` has become an entirely different business in that its market share and customer base may be lost for some time to come, if not forever. `` Today, the business is worth considerably less than the price negotiated last fall,'' the multimillionaire real estate developer said. Eastern has said that increasing the number of pilots is the key to its survival. `` We need pilots to start rebuilding,'' Eastern spokesman <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said Sunday. `` We've waited patiently for the pilots' union to come to its senses.'' A union spokesman, <PERSON> J.B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON>, said he doubted <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> would find many applicants because of an industrywide pilot shortage. `` They want to test the marketplace, and they also want to try to frighten our pilots into thinking they're being replaced. They should have learned by now that intimidation is n't going to work,'' <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> said.

 Real-estate magnate <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> said today he wants to chop more than a third off the $ 365 million price he's willing to pay for the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> shuttle because of the strike that has grounded the carrier In a letter to <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s parent company <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> said, `` The shuttle has become an entirely different business in that its market share and customer base may be lost for some time to come, if not forever.'' `` Today the business is worth considerably less than the price negotiated last fall,'' <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> said. He did not specify how much he's willing to pay now, but told the <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in a telephone interview: `` I'm looking for a reduction in excess of $ 125 million.'' The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> billionaire developing announced last October that he would purchase the moneymaking operation for $ 365 million in cash and name it after himself. However, the strike by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s mechanics and the unwillingness of most of the airlines' pilots to cross picket lines has forced <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> to file for bankruptcy court protection. Only about 200 of the 3,600 Eastern pilots have crossed the lines since the strike by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> began March 4. Eastern has been operating only slightly more than 100 daily fights, about one-tenth its normal level. The airline, which has begun advertising for new pilots, has acknowledged there are no near-term prospects for expanding its operations. Shuttle flights are among those still taking off. The airline has been struggling to keep the shuttle between <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in the air by offering a number of passenger incentives, including promotional fares as low as $ 12. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> said he remained interested in buying the shuttle and would like to close a deal `` before the shuttle operations become worse.'' In his letter, he asked <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> to call him later today to discuss the sale.

 The W.A. <ORGANIZATION> Krueger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> printing firm has agreed to be acquired by <ORGANIZATION> Ringier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> for $ 321 million, company officials said. The two companies have been partners since 1985 in a joint venture, <ORGANIZATION> Krueger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ringier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest printer of paperback books. <PERSON> Krueger </PERSON> <PERSON> Ringier </PERSON> also prints National Geographic and other magazines and catalogs. <PERSON> Krueger </PERSON> chairman <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON> said Monday that the agreement on a cash price of $ 10.50 per share is subject to stockholder approval. <ORGANIZATION> Ringier </ORGANIZATION>, which owns about 5 percent of <PERSON> Krueger </PERSON>, can void the acquisition if it fails to receive enough shares to give it 80 percent ownership, <PERSON> Krueger </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Cliff </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bickell </PERSON> said. The price was the same as <ORGANIZATION> Ringier </ORGANIZATION> offered in January.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Clears Partial Merger Of Detroit Papers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Monday cleared the way for the partial merger of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>'s two daily newspapers under a 1970 law that permits an antitrust exemption for financially failing newspapers. The court, over two dissenting votes, set aside an earlier postponement granted by Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>. In other decisions, the high court again refused to let states and state agencies be sued for allegedly violating federal copyright laws, and rejected an appeal by workers at a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> nuclear power plant who are challenging their employer's random drug tests. In the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> newspapers case, a federal appeals court panel in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> voted 2-1 on Jan. 27 to uphold then-Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s decision to allow the newspapers to form a joint operating agreement under the federal Newspaper Preservation Act. Under the joint operating agreement, the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> and The Detroit News would combine their business, advertising and production departments but maintain separate news and editorial staffs. A group of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> readers and advertisers who sued to stop the partial merger contend that the <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, a morning newspaper owned by <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, is not a failing newspaper even though it lost $ 10 milion a year between 1981 and 1986. The opponents, calling themselves <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Citizens for an <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, say the Free Press and News, which lost $ 50 million in the same period, were unprofitable solely because both papers cut prices in an unsuccessful effort to force each other out of business. <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which owns the News, is the nation's largest newspaper publishing group. <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> is the second largest. In the copyright case, the justices refused to revive allegations that <ORGANIZATION> UCLA </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> state-run university, illegally copied a company's computer programs and instruction manuals. Nine major motion picture studios had urged the court to hear BV Engineering's appeal to broaden protection against what they said is widespread copyright infringement. The movie producers said, for example, that prisons in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> are refusing to pay for films shown to inmates. The justices on Feb. 21 had turned away a similar appeal by a photographer who accused a state university in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> of unauthorized use of his photographs. In the drug-testing case, the court, without comment, left intact a ruling that threw out, at least temporarily, a lawsuit attacking the tests. The justices already are studying the validity of drug tests in three other cases, one involving a private employer and two concerning federal workers or federal regulations.

 Stock prices fell sharply for the second straight session today, still feeling the pressure of the new inflation worries that hit the market on Friday. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 48.57 points Friday, dropped 37.68 to 2,254.46 by 3 p.m. on Wall Street. Losers outnumbered gainers by more than 4 to 1 in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 282 up, 1,210 down and 418 unchanged. Friday's news that the producer price index of finished goods rose a full percentage point in February for the second consecutive month caught many traders by surprise. Interest rates jumped as investors quickly concluded that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> was likely to tighten credit further in its efforts to keep inflation in check.

 Wheat futures prices closed sharply lower Monday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> amid reports of a blizzard in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> but other grain and soybean futures advanced, with soybeans posting fairly strong gains.

Wheat doubled its losses in the afternoon as selling increased following reports that wind-driven snow had closed several highways, including Interstate 70, in western <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, an area especially in need of moisture. `` The market went through some liquidation, despite the fact that when we look at all the precipitation recording during the past 24 hours, it wo n't necessarily be characterized as a drought-breaker,'' said <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>, a grain specialist with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Soybean futures contined their recent upward trend on continuing concerns about tight supplies of soybeans for immediate delivery. At the close, wheat was 5 -RCB- cents to 8 -LCB- cents lower with the contract for delivery in March at $ 4.27 a bushel; corn was -RCB- cent to 1 -RCB- cents higher with March at $ 2.79 a bushel; oats were -LCB- cent lower to 1 cent higher with March at $ 2.09 a bushel; soybeans were 3 cents to 8 cents higher with March at $ 7.77 a bushel.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The former head of a defunct Wall Street brokerage firm was charged Monday with illegally inflating the prices of three stocks in a two-year scheme undone by the 1987 stock market crash. In a 15-count indictment handed up by a federal grand jury, <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Laff </PERSON>, former chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Haas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, was charged in what authorities called the first securities fraud case emanating from the Oct. 19, 1987, crash. The indictment is the latest in a three-year federal crackdown on Wall Street crime and the first by the <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office since the government formed nationwide securities and commodities task forces in January Laff, 51, of <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, was charged with conspiring to manipulate the prices of three over-the-counter stocks to increase the value of substantial holdings owned by <PERSON> Laff </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Haas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>. The indictment is based on the confessions of <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Aslanian </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 29, a former <PERSON> Haas </PERSON> trader and presidentwho pleaded guilty in January to conspiracy and agreed to cooperate with the government. He has not been sentenced. `` I think it's a reflection of an ongoing problem of penny stock fraud,'' Acting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Benito </PERSON> <PERSON> Romano </PERSON> said. `` It's one that deserves our serious consideration generally.'' Attorneys for <PERSON> Laff </PERSON> denied the charges, suggesting that co-conspirators, including <PERSON> Aslanian </PERSON>, wrongly accused <PERSON> Laff </PERSON> of participating in the alleged fraud. `` It seems that in looking at the indictment a lot of conduct of other individuals appears to be attributed to Mr. <PERSON> Laff </PERSON> based on the theories of conspiracy,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lang </PERSON>, an attorney for Laff. The indictment alleges that <PERSON> Laff </PERSON> took part in a conspiracy starting in January 1986 to manipulate the stock prices of <ORGANIZATION> Flores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mexico </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, T.S. <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> O </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tires </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. He is charged with conspiracy, securities fraud, mail fraud and obstructing a <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> investigation. Each of the 15 counts carries a maximum five years in jail and $ 250,000 fine. <ORGANIZATION> Haas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>, through Laff, allegedly cornered the market on shares of the stocks and set artificially high prices. By sustaining the high price, <PERSON> Laff </PERSON> allegedly was able to reap a large profit. The indictment does not specify how much money was involved in the schemes. <ORGANIZATION> Haas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>, a 75-year-old firm that had 12,000 customers before going out of business nine days after the crash, is now liquidating its assets in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> proceedings. The indictment says <PERSON> Laff </PERSON> acted as a `` market maker'' on the stocks by being ready to buy and sell a specific stock at prices published by the firm. Laff, <PERSON> Aslanian </PERSON> and several unnamed co-conspirators, the indictment says, allegedly raised the prices of the manipulated stocks and placed large blocks of shares in friendly accounts that were concealed from the public to create the appearance of demand. The indictment names, but does not charge, <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorin </PERSON>, president of a private investment company that allegedly controlled the accounts and bought blocks of the three stocks. <PERSON> Laff </PERSON> made `` bogus, non-market, unauthorized'' transactions that artificially boosted the share prices without money ever changing hands, the indictment claims. Laff then sold some stocks accumulated by <ORGANIZATION> Haas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> at the inflated prices. The charge also says <PERSON> Laff </PERSON> published false information about the stocks, made unauthorized sales to customers who did not have the money to pay and refused to accept sell orders from customers. <ORGANIZATION> Haas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> went belly-up after the crash because it no longer had the capital to stay in business. Authorities said the alleged scheme to manipulate the stocks could n't be maintained after the market drop and the share prices collapsed. After the crash, investors demanded information about the stocks. <ORGANIZATION> Haas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> allegedly was able to sustain the prices for several days after the crash until it filed for bankruptcy and the manipulated share prices plunged.

 The number of working oil and gas rigs declined by three this week to total 740, <ORGANIZATION> Baker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> reported. Despite occasional weekly increases, the count has followed its historical pattern of decline during the first months of the year, falling from a late-December high of 940. A year ago, the total was 943, the company said Monday. The rig count is a widely watched industry index of drilling activity and it reflects the number of rigs actively exploring for oil as of last Friday, not the number of rigs actively producing oil.

In December 1981 at the height of the oil boom, the rig count reached a peak of 4,500. But oil prices plunged to less than $ 10 per 42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986, prompting a collapse in the rig count that bottomed out at 663 _ the lowest since <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> began compiling figures.

 <ORGANIZATION> Coleman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it had accepted a $ 545 million buyout offer from takeover strategist <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Perelman </PERSON>, who apparently outbid the company's founding family <ORGANIZATION> MacAndrews </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Forbes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which is controlled by <PERSON> Perelman </PERSON>, agreed to pay $ 74 a share in cash for the company, which is the maker of the famed <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> lantern, other outdoor recreation equipment and home heating and air conditioning equipment. The <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> family, which controls about 27 percent of <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>'s 7.1 million common shares outstanding, had offered $ 64 a share Feb. 14 to take the company private in a debt-financed takeover <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, the company's chairman and chief executive, is the grandson of company founder <PERSON> W.C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>. The family reportedly raised its offer to $ 68 per share during a sealed-bid auction required by a special committee of the <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> board that was reviewing the bids. <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> stock rose $ 4.25 a share at $ 72.75 in heavy <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading. A number of analysts had speculated the family's initial overture may have been an attempt to open the company to competing, higher offers. But the family indicated its buyout proposal was aimed at enabling it and senior management to focus on <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>'s long-term interests. Family members also repeatedly said privately they wanted to retain control of the corporation. Neither company would comment beyond a brief statement announcing the deal. The statement did not indicate whether other bids were received. The merger agreement was approved unanimously by the special committee and by <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>'s board of directors. Under the agreement, <ORGANIZATION> MacAndrews </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Forbes </ORGANIZATION> would begin a $ 74 a share tender offer by Friday for all outstanding <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> shares. The offer was conditioned on at least two-thirds of the shares being tendered. The deal also gives <ORGANIZATION> MacAndrews </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Forbes the option to acquire up to 18.5 percent of <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>'s outstanding common shares for $ 74 a share, if those shares are needed to help satisfy the minimum tender provision, the companies said. <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> had record sales of $ 657.9 million and record earnings of $ 24.5 million in 1988. In addition to lanterns, <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> is one of the world's biggest makers of outdoor recreation equipment such as coolers, sleeping bags and pop-up travel trailers. The company also makes air conditioning equipment, lawn movers, home and recreational vehicle heaters, air guns and electrical generators. <ORGANIZATION> MacAndrews </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Forbes </ORGANIZATION> interests range from cosmetics and jewelry to comic books and licorice extract. It is controlled by <PERSON> Perelman </PERSON>, who became chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Revlon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> after leading a successful takeover fight for the cosmetics company and made a lucrative although unsuccessful run at <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the personal products maker. Late last year, a Perelman-led group put up $ 315 million and got $ 5.1 billion of government aid to acquire five bankrupt <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> thrift institutions with assets of more than $ 12 billion. The <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> family had indicated it might sell off the company's heating and air conditioning products division to help pay for its proposed leveraged buyout Analysts said <PERSON> Perelman </PERSON> also might want to sell part of the company's operations, but they doubted there would be a wholesale breakup of <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>. `` So far, they have n't chopped up companies they've acquired,'' said <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> analyst who follows <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Crude Prices Plummet; Products Decline Moderately</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Crude oil prices plummeted in heavy trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> Monday, reversing last week's rally in which prices rose nearly $ 2 a barrel. The April contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude, dropped 82 cents to a closing price of $ 19.51 a barrel, taking back 45 percent of the previous week's gains. On Friday, the April contract closed at $ 20.33, the highest level since Aug. 14, 1987, when crude prices were $ 20.57 a barrel. It capped a week-long rally during which prices rose $ 1.83 a barrel from the previous Friday. Refined oil products traded on the exchange also declined, but not as sharply. Unleaded gasoline for April delivery declined .14 cent to 55.48 cents a gallon, while April heating oil lost .21 cent to settle at 53.36 cents a gallon. Traders said the crude market was technically driven, fueled in part by normal dealings on the last day of the April contract. Other contract months for 1989 had only modest declines. But market fundamentals had not warranted the high price levels reached on Friday, they said. `` The market realized that and took profits today,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Steel </PERSON>, an energy broker at <ORGANIZATION> Refco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The market had expected problems with April deliveries to underpin the recent price rise but they never materialized, some analysts said. `` Instead, the market got a bucket of cold water in the form of the April squeeze not developing,'' said <PERSON> Nauman </PERSON> <PERSON> Barakat </PERSON>, vice president of energy investments at <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Steel </PERSON> said once prices broke through the $ 20 mark on the downside, the momentum picked up `` That prompted a sharp sell-off,'' he said. Strong demand and declining world oil production have helped boost prices recently, but energy specialists had forecast that the market could not sustain prices much higher. `` Demand is not that strong. Given that and given expected slowdowns in economic growth it does n't justify oil being over $ 20 a barrel,'' <PERSON> Steel </PERSON> said. Brokers said the slower decline in product prices helped an even sharper fall in crude prices.

 The stock market fell sharply for the second straight session Monday under pressure from new inflation worries. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 29.64 to 2,262.50, extending its loss over the past two trading days to 78.21 points. Declining issues outnumbered advances by more than 3 to 1 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 357 up, 1,156 down and 430 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 151.26 million shares, down from 242.90 million Friday, when the total was swollen by the so-called triple witching hour involving expiring options and futures on stock indexes. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 179.35 million shares. Friday's news that the producer price index of finished goods rose a full percentage point in February for the second consecutive month caught many traders by surprise. Interest rates jumped as investors quickly concluded that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> was likely to tighten credit further in its efforts to keep inflation in check. Rates were higher again Monday in the credit markets. Interest rates on three-month to one-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills climbed about 20 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. More evidence of trouble is expected on Tuesday when the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reports on the consumer price index for last month. Fears have increased on the Street that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> might wind up pushing the economy to the brink of a recession before it sees any signs that its anti-inflation campaign is working. <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> led the active list, down 3 at 109 -LCB- on top of a 5 | - point drop Friday, when the company said its first-quarter earnings would fall short of analysts Other losers among the blue chips included <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION>, down -RCB- at 49 -LRB-; <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>, down | at 44 -LCB-; <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION>, down 2 ~ at 106 -RCB-, and <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION>, down -RRB- at 42 <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> gained 13 -LRB- to 130 -LRB-. The company, fighting a takeover bid by a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investor group, agreed to be acquired by <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aquitane </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> for $ 132 a share. <ORGANIZATION> Reebok </ORGANIZATION> rose 1 \ to 14 on talk that a management group was discussing a possible buyout By contrast, <ORGANIZATION> Syntex </ORGANIZATION> fell 2 | to 40 | after a rumored takeover bid failed to As measured by <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>' index of more than 5,000 actively traded stocks, the market lost $ 26.86 billion, or 0.93 percent, in value.

 Opponents of the partial merger of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>'s two major daily newspapers will ask the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to hear their appeal, despite the court's refusal Monday to further delay the business deal The court, with only two justices dissenting, lifted without comment a postponement granted March 4 by Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>. The order cleared the way for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, owned by <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, owned by <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, to merge their business and production operations under an antitrust exemption allowed by the 1970 Newspaper Preservation Act. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s approval of the partial merger was challenged by a coalition of newspaper readers and advertisers, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Citizens for an <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, and Public Citizen, a Washington-based advocacy group. `` We lost a battle in the war,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Schultz </PERSON>, attorney for Public Citizen. `` On the other hand, I feel much better because there were two dissents than if there would have been no dissents at all. The fact that we got two dissents puts us in the serious category.'' With the lifting of the stay, the newspapers can begin immediately to put their partial merger into effect. But a <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> vice president, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, said it was too early to discuss timing of the merger. `` Obviously there have to be some discussions with our friends at <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> said. Opponents' intention to continue their appeal to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> means the newspapers had to decide whether to proceed with the merger at the risk of the court later ordering it dismantled. `` Once the merger is implemented, the egg has been scrambled, and how do you unscramble the egg,'' said <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Spaeth </PERSON>, a political scientist at <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lansing </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, who specializes in the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. `` If the merger was consummated and then terminated, it would be almost like starting up a new newspaper, and you just do n't do that in a metropolitan area on a daily basis at this point in time,'' he said. <PERSON> Schultz </PERSON> said he was confident there were sufficient votes on the court to grant a petition to hear the cases. The court's order did not specify how many of the seven non-dissenting justices in fact supported lifting the stay. <PERSON> Spaeth </PERSON>, however, said the court's refusal to delay the merger made it unlikely they would consent to hear the case. Justices <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> voted to extend the postponement until the court considers a formal appeal by those who oppose the partial merger. `` I ca n't think of a nicer way to start out the week,'' Free Press Publisher <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> said. `` Finally, we seem to be near the point where we can assure the readers of the Free Press that their newspaper is saved.'' Neither <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> nor the News commented on the justice's decision. Opponents of the joint operating agreement argued that the Free Press was not a failing newspaper even though it lost $ 10 million a year between 1981 and 1986. The News lost $ 50 million in the same period. The losses were due solely to price-cutting by the newspapers in an unsuccessful effort to force each other out of business, the opponents said. The opponents' emergency request to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said the agreement `` threatens the independence of daily newspapers in 25 cities'' where, like <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, competing newspapers still exist. <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> has threatened to close the Free Press if the joint operating agreement is denied.

 <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> plans no immediate cost cuts in response to a <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> deregulation move last week, <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said Monday. Abolishing the regulations by which <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> sets long-distance rates in favor of linking rate increases to inflation does n't completely deregulate long-distance service, <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said. `` The ruling last Thursday is a step toward full deregulation of <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION>, but it is just a step,'' he told a news conference before a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. The deregulation is intended partly to give <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T incentives to increase efficiency, since its profits will no longer be limited to a fixed rate of return on investment. But <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said, `` We're not planning any cost-cutting moves as a result of the decision.'' Also at the news conference, <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> questioned the prospects for what he said is needed federal deficit-fighting action, and he voiced his own irritation with automated, tape-recorded sales pitches to people's home telephones. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> questioned whether <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s administration, after squabbling over stage-setting matters such as <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>'s unsuccessful nomination as defense secretary, can get along well enough to battle the federal budget deficit Definite action also is needed to reverse nearly 10 years of ignoring the national debt, <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said. `` A lot of people are saying the right things. At this point I am a little skeptical about that. I am not sure that recent events in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> will create the kind of harmony between the leadership and the administration to make that happen.'' But he said, `` There's always hope with a new administration.'' Regarding computer-operated, tape-recorded sales messages some companies automatically play over people's telephones, <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said he did not favor regulatory action. `` I do n't like it,'' <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said. `` I am personally offended by a computer trying to talk to me.'' <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said it was up to customers to discourage such sales tactics through their reaction against products marketed that way. `` Innovators will always find ways to market their products,'' he said. `` But the marketplace works. If most people find them offensive, they wo n't be rewarded for their efforts, and they will try something else.''

<HEAD>Wheat Futures Tumble As Rain, Snow Moisten Fields</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Wheat futures prices fell sharply Monday on reports that badly needed precipitation in the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> had improved growing conditions for the winter wheat crop. Other grain and soybean futures advanced, with soybeans posting some fairly strong gains. On other markets, precious metals were mixed; copper futures fell; livestock and meat futures were mostly higher; and energy futures finished mostly lower. Wheat settled 5 -RCB- cents to 8 \ cents lower on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> with the contract for delivery in March at $ 4.26 \ a bushel; corn was 1 cent to 2 cents higher with March at $ 2.79 \ a bushel; oats were -LCB- cent lower to 1 cent higher with March at $ 2.09 a bushel; soybeans were 2 -RCB- cents to 8 -LCB- cents higher with March at $ 7.76 -RCB- The wheat market had opened lower and remained depressed throughout the morning after the weekend precipitation in the Plains. Winter wheat now is maturing in the central and southern states and northern farmers are preparing for spring planting. Selling increased in the afternoon, doubling wheat's losses, following reports that wind-driven snow had closed several highways, including Interstate 70, in western <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, an area especially in need of moisture. `` The market went through some liquidation, despite the fact that when we look at all the precipitation recording during the past 24 hours, it wo n't necessarily be characterized as a drought-breaker,'' said <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>, a grain specialist with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Analyst <PERSON> Katharina </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmer </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION> agreed that the weekend preciptation had not been heavy, especially in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>. But she said: `` We went into the weekend not expecting rain and now it's still raining and snowing, maybe enough to make people abandon their long -LRB- or buy -RRB- positions.'' After the close, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> issued a forecast calling for above-average precipitation in the Plains and the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> next week, which could lend a bearish tone to trading on Tuesday. Gold futures advanced moderately on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, continuing the rally launched Friday by fears of rising inflation. Silver futures retreated slightly. Copper futures dropped sharply on the Commodity Exchange, displaying the volatility that has rocked the market for several weeks amid tight-supply concerns. Gold settled $ 2.40 to $ 3.40 higher with April at $ 397.40 a troy ounce; silver was 0.8 cent to 1.1 cents lower with May at $ 6.185 a troy ounce. Copper settled 2.9 cents to 3.55 cents lower with May at $ 1.3335 a pound. Most cattle futures advanced on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in reaction to firmer cash markets. The April contract reached a new life-of-contract high _ 78.67 cents a pound _ for the second consecutive session. Pork futures were dragged down by weak cash markets for most of the session, but a wave of late buying brought the market to a mixed close. Live cattle settled .30 cent lower to .52 cent higher with April at 78.57 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .30 cent to .65 cent higher with March at 80.05 cents a pound; live hogs were .17 cent lower to .25 cent higher with April at 42.62 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .05 cent to .67 cent higher with March at 37.62 cents a pound. Most crude-oil futures retreated slightly in a thin market, although the April contract dropped 82 cents a barrel as traders bailed out of long positions prior to Wednesday's expiration. Futures on refined products ended mixed. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 1 cent to 82 cents lower with April at $ 19.51 a barrel; heating oil was .46 cent lower to .13 cent higher with April at 53.36 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .10 cent to .42 cent lower with April at 55.48 cents a gallon.

 Developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> lowered his offer for <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' shuttle by at least $ 125 million Monday because of damage to the service by a walkout by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> and pilots. `` I bought something that had a 57 percent share of the market,'' the billionaire said in a telephone interview. `` That share has deteriorated considerably.'' In response, Miami-based <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> sent <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> a letter Monday afternoon informing him the carrier is seeking other bids for the shuttle. The letter says <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> has recently received `` other offers unsolicited'' and invites <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> to re-submit a bid. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> announced last October that he planned to acquire the lucrative three-city shuttle service from <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s parent <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 365 million. But on Monday, <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> said he wants to cut the offered price by more than a third. `` I'm looking for a reduction in excess of $ 125 million,'' he said, adding that he considered $ 200 million a reasonable offer. <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, an airline analyst for the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s move could reopen the bidding for the shuttle while signaling the developer's reluctance to get into the airline business. Art Kent, a spokesman for Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>, did not return repeated calls for comment. Excerpts from <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s letter to <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, signed by <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, senior vice president for legal affairs at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, were released in a statement. `` We believe it is our obligation to all our constituencies _ creditors, shareholders, employees and the communities and traveling public we service _ to ensure that any shuttle sale is completed on the best possible terms for <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> wrote to <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>. `` Your intention to not proceed at this time on the terms in the Oct. 12 agreement requires that we take action, consistent with our obligations under the reorganization process to solicit offers from third parties for the shuttle.'' On March 4, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s 8,500-member <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union, chiefly mechanics and baggage handlers, walked off the job. The refusal of most of the airline's pilots to cross the Machinists' picket lines has forced Eastern to file for protection from creditors under the bankruptcy laws. Eastern's hourly shuttle service, usually a profitable operation linking <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, has been flying during the strike. In the first days of the walkout, most Eastern shuttle flights flew nearly empty, but the airline has been trying to rebuild its business with a number of passenger incentives, including promotional fares as low as $ 12. Fares returned to normal on Saturday. Eastern made another pitch Monday to lure shuttle passengers. Starting March 23, when the cut-rate weekday fares of $ 49 return to $ 99, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> will offer an on-time guarantee on shuttle flights. If the shuttle plane is more than five minutes pulling away from the gate, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> will greet the arriving passengers with refunds on the spot or free tickets for other shuttle flights. The exceptions would be delays caused by airport problems or severe weather. A rival shuttle service operated by New York-based <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has been flying with full passenger loads. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> has seen business on its shuttle service double since the strike began, said <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Manners </PERSON>. The airline has added flights and introduced larger aircraft to accommodate the increased demand, she said. In a letter sent Monday to <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> said, `` Last fall I agreed to buy a fully operational shuttle which held nearly 60 percent of the market, commanded the principal loyalty and confidence of business travelers and provided excellent service to the customer. `` However, as you and I discussed, the shuttle has become an entirely different business in that its market share and customer base may be lost for some time to come, if not forever.'' The shuttle `` is worth considerably less than the price negotiated last fall,'' <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> said. Eastern spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashlock </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> said the airline has been encouraged by shuttle traffic and it was showing signs of luring back its regular business travelers. He referred requests for comment about the <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> letter to <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> office also referred calls to the <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> headquarters. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Nobles </PERSON>, president of the Trump Shuttle, the company formed in anticipation of purchasing the Eastern shuttle, estimated <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> was now carrying about 20 percent of the shuttle market. Systemwide, Eastern is operating only about 100 flights a day, about one-tenth of its normal flight schedule. The airline has begun advertising for new pilots, while acknowledging there are no near-term prospects for expanding its operations. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, who promised to rename the hourly service `` The Trump Shuttle'' and redecorate the blue-silver <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727s, said Monday he was still interested in buying the operation and was prepared to close a deal with <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> within a week. `` I'm not surprised he'd want to lower his price considering the strike and the troubles -LRB- Eastern's -RRB- had,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Decker </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Duff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Phelps </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> dealt a severe blow to an investor group's hostile takeover bid Monday by agreeing to a $ 1 billion `` white knight'' buyout by the French government-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aquitaine </ORGANIZATION>. Some analysts said they did not expect any rival bids to top the French oil and chemical company's $ 132 a share offer for each of <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION>'s approximately 8 million common shares outstanding. Centaur, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investment group that was offering $ 110 a share for <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION>, issued a statement extending its offer through 5 p.m. EST Friday. The offer, which had been set to expire at 5 p.m. Monday, was extended to give the group time to review the agreement with <PERSON> Elf </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquitaine </PERSON>, the statement read. The group controls about 12.7 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION>'s common shares. <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> jumped $ 13.12 -LCB- to $ 130.12 -LCB- a share on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Elf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aquitaine </LOCATION> said it would begin a tender offer for the <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> shares on or before Friday with a scheduled expiration 20 business days later. The merger, which would maintain <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION>'s name and keep its headquarters in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, is subject to shareholder approval. The boards of both companies have approved the agreement. `` We are delighted that <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> is becoming a member of a global organization in which there is such a strong strategic fit between our businesses,'' <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> chairman and chief executive <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuttle </PERSON> said in a statement. Unlike <ORGANIZATION> Centaur </ORGANIZATION>'s offers, which <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> repeatedly spurned, <PERSON> Tuttle </PERSON> called the <LOCATION> Elf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aquitaine </LOCATION> buyout `` in the best interests of all <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> stakeholders.'' <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> <PERSON> Maunoury </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> Elf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aquitaine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the corporation's <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> holding company based in <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, said in a telephone interview the deal had been under discussion for three to four weeks and he did not expect any trouble completing it. <PERSON> Maunoury </PERSON> said the merger would enhance <ORGANIZATION> Elf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aquitaine </ORGANIZATION>'s efforts to develop its specialty chemical business and to increase its presence outside <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` It's a good company,'' he said. `` ... It has good sales all around the world, everything.'' <LOCATION> Elf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aquitaine </LOCATION>, in which the French government owns a controlling interest, has more than $ 20 billion in annual sales with more than a third related to chemicals. Analysts said the deal likely would succeed. `` It gives the shareholders top dollar,'' said <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Pattison </PERSON>, a chemical analyst for <PERSON> C.J </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>, <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Grenfell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` I do n't see any way anybody could get any more out of it. It's really a credit to management, because they stuck to their guns and they really got a blue-chip purchaser.'' Centaur, headed by financiers <PERSON> Abbey </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> and <PERSON> Melvyn </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Estrin </PERSON>, announced last June it had acquired a 6.5 percent interest in <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION>, which then was trading at about $ 62 a share. <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> responded by selling its drug and equipment businesses and buying back about 40 percent of its outstanding shares. Centaur made its initial $ 100 a share offer on Dec. 13, but <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> had resisted <ORGANIZATION> Centaur </ORGANIZATION>'s overtures since indicated it would seek other alternatives such as further restructuring or a sale of the company to a third party. <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION>, which had $ 1.02 billion in sales in 1988, repeatedly has refused to meet with <ORGANIZATION> Centaur </ORGANIZATION>, saying the offer was inadequate and the partners unworthy. Centaur received a setback earlier this month when a federal judge blocked a special shareholders meeting the partnership had hoped to use to stage a proxy fight for control of <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors. On Feb. 23, <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> announced it planned to sell its <ORGANIZATION> Wallace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Tiernan </PERSON> equipment division based in <LOCATION> Belleville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, for more than $ 40 million to a management-led group as part of its defensive strategy. In a separate announcement Monday, <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> said it had agreed to sell an Italian subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Italia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SpA </ORGANIZATION>, to <ORGANIZATION> Akzo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemicals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> BV </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>. Terms were not disclosed.

<HEAD>Convenience Store Owner Says Losses Reflect Buyout</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Southland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, owner of 7-Eleven convenience stores, Monday reported it lost $ 37 millionin the fourth quarter and $ 216.2 million for all of last year, reflecting high interest costs and other expenses related to its 1987 leveraged buyout. The losses occurred despite strong operating results for its 7-Eleven stores. Revenue amounted to $ 1.97 billion in the three months ended Dec. 31 and $ 7.99 billion in all of 1988. Because of the buyout, the seven months ended July 31, 1987 were reported on a separate accounting basis than subsequent periods, which means results from the two periods within 1987 can not be added together to produce 1987 full-year financial results, and no full-year comparisons can be made between 1987 and 1988. <ORGANIZATION> Southland </ORGANIZATION>'s 1988 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization was $ 494.3 million, including $ 16.5 million from divested operations, the company said. <PERSON> Jere </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Southland </ORGANIZATION>'s president and chief executive officer, called that figure `` the most appropriate measure of our progress.'' `` We're very pleased overall with the company's operating and financial achievements during its first full year after undergoing one of the largest leveraged buyouts in history,'' <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said in a prepared statement. <ORGANIZATION> Southland </ORGANIZATION> added 600 convenience stores to its 7-Eleven international operation in 1988. The division now includes nearly 5,300 stores operated by licensees and affiliates in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and 19 foreign countries. <ORGANIZATION> Southland </ORGANIZATION> operates about 7,000 additional convenience stores in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, and owns a 50 percent interest in <ORGANIZATION> Citgo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The company has completed the sale of 910 operating convenience stores and virtually all of its other businesses scheduled for divestiture as part of the LBO. To date, the company has repaid $ 977.5 million of its original $ 2.55 billion LBO bank debt.

 <ORGANIZATION> Emhart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it had agreed to be acquired by <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Decker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in a $ 2.8 billion takeover to thwart a hostile $ 2.4 billion buyout attempt by an investor group that includes oil heir <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Getty </PERSON>. The $ 40 a share agreement, unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both companies, came weeks after Farmington-based <ORGANIZATION> Emhart </ORGANIZATION> spurned the unsolicited $ 35 a share offer from the Getty group, known as <ORGANIZATION> Topper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> L.P. </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Emhart </ORGANIZATION>'s, president, chairman and chief executive officer, said the combination with <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Decker </PERSON>, a leading tool and appliance maker, would create business synergies that should benefit <ORGANIZATION> Emhart </ORGANIZATION> shareholders. `` The agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Decker </PERSON> also alleviates my concern that prolonging the takeover battle with <PERSON> Topper </PERSON> could have adverse effects on certain segments of <ORGANIZATION> Emhart </ORGANIZATION>'s business,'' he said. <PERSON> Topper </PERSON> issued a statement saying it was `` stunned and outraged'' over the agreement and that it was not asked to make a higher offer. The group indicated its offer remained negotiable and said it was studhing `` numerous options.'' <ORGANIZATION> Emhart </ORGANIZATION> stock fell 37 -LCB- cents a share to $ 40.75 in <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> composite trading. <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Decker </PERSON> fell $ 2.62 -LCB- a share to close at $ 20.75. Both <ORGANIZATION> Emhart </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Decker </PERSON> have been heavily involved in takeover activity during recent years. <ORGANIZATION> Emhart </ORGANIZATION> staged an unsuccessful, hostile bid to acquire <ORGANIZATION> Stanadyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a maker of plumbing fixtures, automotive and metal products, in early 1988. <PERSON> Stanadyne </PERSON> escaped by undergoing an $ 820 million leveraged buyout led by the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Forstmann </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Little </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> has overseen a restructuring at <ORGANIZATION> Emhart </ORGANIZATION> that has resulted in the sale of some 18 businesses and the purchase of several key product lines since September 1986, such as Price Pfister plumbing fixtures and GardenAmerica in-ground watering systems <ORGANIZATION> Emhart </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Decker </PERSON> indicated they planned to sell <ORGANIZATION> Emhart </ORGANIZATION>'s electronics and information systems division under an overall debt reduction program Black & amp; <PERSON> Decker </PERSON> acquired the small appliance business of <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> several years ago. The company also waged a lengthy unsuccessful battle last year to acquire <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a New York-based plumbing and air conditioning equipment maker, and has been seeking other acquisitions since. <PERSON> Nolan </PERSON> <PERSON> Archibald </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Decker </PERSON>'s president and chief executive officer, said <ORGANIZATION> Emhart </ORGANIZATION> would broaden his company's product base and provide `` excellent growth opportunities for <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Decker </PERSON> for years to come.'' `` The do-it-yourself products of <ORGANIZATION> Emhart </ORGANIZATION>'s consumer sector fit ideally with our power-tool business, broadening our lines with non-competing products moving through identical channels of distribution,'' he said. The companies said they were considering cutbacks in <ORGANIZATION> Emhart </ORGANIZATION>'s 30,000-member workforce but had made no decisions They also said <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Decker </PERSON> had agreed to honor all <ORGANIZATION> Emhart </ORGANIZATION> employee severance plans. Black & amp; <PERSON> Decker </PERSON>, with annual sales of about $ 2.3 billion, is the world's leading producer of power tools and household products. The company posted a profit of $ 33 million on revenue of $ 705.5 million for its first quarter ended Dec. 25. <ORGANIZATION> Emhart </ORGANIZATION> is a diversified producer of industrial and commercial products and information and electronic systems. <ORGANIZATION> Emhart </ORGANIZATION> had 1988 revenue of $ 2.76 billion and net income of $ 126.6 million. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> <PERSON> Quain </PERSON>, an analyst with <PERSON> Wertheim </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroder </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Decker </PERSON> could suffer from the debt it must incur to finance the buyout, if high interest rates slow housing development and thus suppress demand for its products. But <PERSON> Quain </PERSON> also said that naming <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> as a director and chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Decker </PERSON> would give the company a better shareholder focus. <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Decker </PERSON> will begin a $ 40 a share tender offer for all outstanding shares of <ORGANIZATION> Emhart </ORGANIZATION> common stock. The buyout was conditioned on at least two-thirds of <ORGANIZATION> Emhart </ORGANIZATION>'s common shares being tendered. In rejecting the Topper bid earlier this month, <ORGANIZATION> Emhart </ORGANIZATION> said the offer was too low and appeared to be tainted by insider trading. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> cited unusual trading activity before announcement of the offer by <PERSON> Topper </PERSON>, whose partners also include <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> real estate developers <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> and <PERSON> Zachary </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Emhart </ORGANIZATION>'s stock, which was selling at $ 32.75 when <ORGANIZATION> Topper </ORGANIZATION> tendered its offer, had risen almost $ 10 in the month prior to the offer amid takeover rumors.

 The founder of the <PERSON> Carl </PERSON>'s Jr. hamburger chain lost a bid Monday to have a federal insider trading case against him and several relatives dismissed. In rejecting a dismissal motion by <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Karcher </PERSON>'s attorney, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafeedie </PERSON> ruled that a jury should hear <PERSON> Karcher </PERSON>'s claim that the civil case against him is based only on circumstantial evidence. <PERSON> Karcher </PERSON> is accused of passing on information that allowed several relatives to avoid losses on stock in <ORGANIZATION> Carl </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Karcher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which runs 460 <PERSON> Carl </PERSON>'s Jr. fast-food outlets in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and the West.

 Owners of the <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> nuclear power plant bought a bond Monday to guarantee enough money to decommission the reactor if necessary after tests, a move that could give them their long-sought low-power license. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission, in an unprecedented move, ordered <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> owners in December to show they could come up with $ 72 million to tear down and clean up the plant after the low-power tests with radioactive fuel if the plant fails to overcome evacuation-planning and financial obstacles to a commercial license. Opponents have argued that towns in the area could not be safely evacuated in case of a reactor accident. One of the 12 New <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> utilities that own the plant has sought bankruptcy protection becuse of debt associated with the plant. The owners paid $ 8.5 million Monday to <ORGANIZATION> Aetna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Casualty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Surety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, to insure any part of the $ 72 million that the owners could not come up with themselves, said <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>. He said <ORGANIZATION> Aetna </ORGANIZATION> would refund as much as $ 6 million if the plant operates commercially. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, president of <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> operator <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yankee </ORGANIZATION>, called the bond purchase `` a significant milestone for Seabrook Station.'' `` We have now met all of the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>'s -RRB- stringent requirements to receive a low-power license and begin important testing of <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON>'s reactor,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said in a statement. The <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> left it to its staff to approve the bond and issue the low-power license, though the commission gave opponents 10 days after the license is issued to seek a stay. `` If the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> staff takes a week or two to review this and then there's a 10-day waiting period, it looks like we could be in a position to receive low-power in the first part of April,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. Veteran plant foe <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Backus </PERSON>, lawyer for the <ORGANIZATION> Seacoast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anti-Pollution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, noted that the surety bond, if approved, is the last obstacle to low-power tests at the $ 5.9 billion Seabrook project, which originally was planned for commercial operation 10 years ago. `` So it's not a good day as far as I'm concerned,'' <PERSON> Backus </PERSON> said. In another Seabrook-related development Monday, Gov. <PERSON> Judd </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>'s office announced that the state will start intensive negotiations with lead plant owner <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> and its creditors on a bankruptcy reorganization plan for the utility <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> sought bankruptcy protection 14 months ago because of debt from its 36 percent <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> share. <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>, in a departure from unwavering state support for <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION>, announced earlier this month he will try to block testing of the plant until commercial operation is assured. He called it bad business judgment to contaminate the plant before a commercial license is guaranteed. State officials said they plan to request within the next week in bankruptcy court that the testing be stopped. On Tuesday, an <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> licensing board opens what could be the last round of hearings on the plant's commercial license. The Atomic Safety and <ORGANIZATION> Licensing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> will hold hearings for several months in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> on evacuation plans that <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> developed for nearby <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> communities that refuse to cooperate. <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> maintains that no evacuation plans could work for the crowded beaches and communities within <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON>'s 10-mile emergency-planning zone.

 The parent corporation of strike-crippled <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> got double trouble Monday when <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> cut his bid for <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s shuttle and flight attendants called a strike at sister carrier <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. There were few signs of disruption from the strike by the flight attendants union at <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>, but <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> flight attendants' union local, predicted the walkout would grow. `` Right now, they're still trying to get the word out,'' Ms. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>'s flight attendants voted in December to authorize a strike over wages and have been free to walk out since then, union leader <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Winkler </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> said parent <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has been trying to offset <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s strike, begun March 4 by its <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union and joined by the pilots and flight attendants, by increasing <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>'s service Only about 200 <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> pilots, about half of them management, are flying, and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> is operating less than 10 percent of its pre-strike schedule of 1,040 daily flights. <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>'s executive vice president and chief operating officer, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>, said that as of midday Monday, only 35 attendants were participating in that walkout and would be `` permanently replaced.'' Ms. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>, speaking at her union hall where walls were decorated with posters showing a Dracula figure representing <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, said unions will announce new actions aimed at <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday. She declined to give details. In another development Monday, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> charged that <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> pilots operating during the strike are omitting pre-flight aircraft inspections, an external visual check which must be done before departure. `` That's an absolute lie perpetrated by the pilot's association as another tactic to scare the public,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Matell </PERSON>. `` There's been no violation of any regulations and <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> knows that, but they do n't care.'' Meanwhile, <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> said that because of the strike he no longer thought <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> shuttle service was worth the $ 365 million he offered last year. He said he'd like to cut the price by more than $ 125 million. The deal has been awaiting final approval, and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> last week said it would ask <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> filed March 9 for Chapter 11 protection and bankruptcy reorganization, to expedite the sale to <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>. In a letter to <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> said: `` The shuttle has become an entirely different business in that its market share and customer base may be lost for some time to come, if not forever.'' Eastern replied with an afternoon letter telling <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> it was seeking other bids for the shuttle. The letter, which the airline issued in a public statement, said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> has recently received `` other offers unsolicited'' and invited <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> to re-submit a bid. Eastern officials said passenger traffic on the 62 daily flights on the <LOCATION> Boston-New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York-Washington </LOCATION> shuttle has improved steadily since the first days of the strike, when some flights carried as few as seven passengers. For one week it slashed weekday fares from $ 99 to $ 49 one way and weekend fares from $ 69 to $ 12 to lure passengers back. Eastern made another pitch Monday to lure shuttle passengers. Starting March 23, when the cut-rate weekday fares of $ 49 returns to $ 99, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> will offer an on-time guarantee on shuttle flights. If the shuttle plane is more than five minutes pulling away from the gate, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> will greet the arriving passengers with refunds on the spot or free tickets for other shuttle flights. The exceptions would be delays caused by airport problems or severe weather. A rival shuttle service operated by New York-based <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has been flying with full passenger loads. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> has seen business on its shuttle service double since the strike began, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Manners </PERSON>. The airline has added flights and introduced larger aircraft to accommodate the increased demand, she said. A Teamsters leader at <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, said his union has initiated `` guerrilla warfare'' against <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> operations, especially its Northeast shuttle service. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Genoese </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION>' Airline Division and head of the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> local, said the action was taken to show his union's support for the Eastern strike and to protest <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>'s imposition of $ 35 million in pay cuts on its <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> last year The `` guerrilla'' tactics include deliberate diversion of baggage and cargo and cancellation of passengers' reservations, he said. When the <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> strike deadline came at 10 a.m. EST, some flight attendants set up picket lines at the carrier's main <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> hub, but flights appeared to be departing and arriving normally. Pickets also were reported at <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. There are about 6,800 <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> flight attendants, but the union has been without a contract since <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>'s 1983 Chapter 11 reorganization. The company says only 5 percent of its attendants belong to the union, and the union says 60 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>'s pilots and machinists lost their unions in 1983 <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Messing </PERSON> said the flight attendants' walkout is `` like an annual event. An Easter 1988 call for a sickout failed to materialize, and `` there's no reason to believe this attempt will be any more successful,'' he said. Messing said <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> operates about 1,400 flights daily serving 120 cities in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and abroad. The union says <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> flight attendants are paid $ 11,000 to $ 15,000 annually, 30 to 50 percent lower than their counterparts at other airlines. But <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>, the airline vice president, said <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> is paying `` comparable industry rates.'' He added that the airline on Jan. 1 implemented a $ 19 million wage and fringe benefit increase. It was not immediately clear how many flight attendants walked off their jobs and how many were picketing on their days off. In another development related to the Eastern strike, a federal judge in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> denied a request by unionized workers at four <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> area commuter railroads to delay his order barring them from honoring Eastern picket lines. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who signed preliminary injunctions barring sympathy strikes at the four rail lines late Friday, refused to temporarily delay them while the unions appealed.
