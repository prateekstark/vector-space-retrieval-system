Jackson eulogy</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Rev. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> eulogized former <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> anchorman <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> on Friday as a man who `` would n't adjust, would n't knuckle under the face of racism.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, a close friend of <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>'s, delivered the eulogy at a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> church where friends and co-workers of the nation's first black network television anchor paid their last respects to <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>. The former anchor, said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, `` would n't adjust, would n't knuckle under the face of obvious and not so obvious racism. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> had been ill for more than a year when he died Tuesday at <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> of complications resulting from AIDS. He was 49. `` <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> never adjusted,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` He sought to transform. He was not a TV thermometer who measured things and spilled them back out. He tried to be a thermostat _ to change the temperature.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told reporters that he talked to <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> about how <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> contracted AIDS and that <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> told him: `` It is not homosexuality but it was promiscuity. ... Let my predicament be a source of education to our people.'' Among those attending the ceremony were ABC News President <PERSON> Roone </PERSON> <PERSON> Arledge </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> anchorman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> anchorman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rather </PERSON>, 60 Minutes reporter <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> anchorman <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>. `` I think ABC News is a better place today than it was before <PERSON> Max </PERSON> was there,'' said <PERSON> Arledge </PERSON>. `` A lot of that is due to his efforts.'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> began his broadcasting career as a radio station disc jockey in his hometown of <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION>. He moved to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in 1965 and three years later became the first black to anchor newscasts at a major TV station, appearing on the 6 p.m. and 11 p.m. news on Channel 9 <ORGANIZATION> WTOP </ORGANIZATION>, now <ORGANIZATION> WUSA </ORGANIZATION>, with co-anchor <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> then left <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> after 10 years at the top of the ratings to join <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> as the first black to anchor a network news show. He was one of three anchors at <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, along with <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> and <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>. `` He did an enormous amount for us,'' said <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>. `` He did an enormous amount, I think, for his community. ... When <PERSON> Max </PERSON> died, we all hoped he'd find some peace.'' The frustrated <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> made headlines publicly denouncing racism at the news organization during a speech at <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in February 1981. <PERSON> Arledge </PERSON> was supervising news coverage when <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> was an anchor, and he changed <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>' three-anchor format after <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> died in 1983. At that point, <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> inherited the job as sole anchor of the newscasts, and <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> was assigned to do news briefs and weekend anchor. In 1984, he left <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and joined <ORGANIZATION> WMAQ-TV </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. The following June, he entered a hospital specializing in alcohol rehabilitation suffering from emotional and physical exhaustion, according to <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Aronson </PERSON>, director of communications at <ORGANIZATION> WMAQ-TV </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Aronson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> never returned to the station, and did sporadic freelance work after that. `` I think one of my basic flaws has been the lack of esteem, not really feeling great about myself, always feeling like I had to do more,'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said in a <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> profile. He is survived by his mother, <PERSON> Doris </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>, and stepfather, the Rev. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>, both from <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, and four children, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON>, <PERSON> Maureen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> and <PERSON> Malik </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> also leaves three surviving siblings, <PERSON> Jewel </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepperd </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> <PERSON> Yancey </PERSON> and civil rights activist <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, the head of <ORGANIZATION> TransAfrica </ORGANIZATION>. All live in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. There will be no private funeral, as <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>'s family has decided to have his remains cremated.

<HEAD>China Arrests Man Linked To U.S.-Based Dissident Group</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A man linked to a U.S.-based Chinese dissident group has been arrested, and an organization he led has been suppressed, according to two official newspapers. The reports said <PERSON> Lei </PERSON> <PERSON> Yuanhai </PERSON> and five members of his group received funds from the New York-based <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>. The group, established in 1983 by a former <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> citizen, advocates democracy in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> News and the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday that <PERSON> Lei </PERSON> and his colleagues had been accused of passing out copies of `` <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Spring </LOCATION>,'' the alliance's magazine that is banned in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. In addition, they allegedly `` attacked the dictatorship of the people and the socialist system, and actively plotted riotous, illegal activities.'' The reports, which cited no specific instances of illegal activities, said Lei founded the <LOCATION> Chongqing </LOCATION> branch of the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> two years ago. Following its founding, the branch received regular payments from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and agents came to <LOCATION> Chongqing </LOCATION> to help with organizing, the reports said. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> News and the People's Daily said Lei and the five others have admitted their involvement in the group and expressed repentance. A letter of apology, written by <PERSON> Lei </PERSON>, has been published in the Chongqing Daily. The reports said the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> had taken note of Lei's apology and would deal leniently with <PERSON> Lei </PERSON> and the five others. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> tolerates little political dissent. Political reform here is viewed by the state as a necessary evil that will help spwr economic growth. Any moves that would challenge the supremacy of the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> are checked. The press remains tightly controlled. And tough censorship laws limit access to new political ideas. The <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, is run by <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Bingzhang </PERSON>, now a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen. <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> came to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> in the late 1970s from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to study at <ORGANIZATION> McGill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>. In 1983, he became an American citizen and the alliance was founded. <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> has said the alliance receives money from <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and from other Chinese groups interested in democracy in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. His organization, he says, is committed to bringing about a democratic revolution in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wang </PERSON>'s group and magazine, `` <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> Spring,'' are relatively popular among the 27,000 Chinese students now studying in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The magazine regularly runs articles written by people it says are `` sources in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.'' The magazine takes its name from `` <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Spring,'' a period of time from 1979-80 when <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> experienced relative cultural and political freedoms. The magazine lists as honorary co-editors, <PERSON> Wei </PERSON> <PERSON> Jingsheng </PERSON>, <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> Qing and <PERSON> Xu </PERSON> <PERSON> Wenli </PERSON>, three imprisoned dissidents who were active during the `` Beijing Spring'' period. However, there is no known connection between the dissidents and <PERSON> Wang </PERSON>'s group.

 Korean Air Flight 858 disappears over the jungle near the Thailand-Burma border. All 115 people aboard the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 707 are killed. Suspicion about a planted bomb focused on two passengers, a man and woman, detained after they were questioned about forged Japanese passports and bit into cyanide capsules hidden in cigarette filters. The couple had left the <ORGANIZATION> KAL </ORGANIZATION> flight, which was bound from <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> Abu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dhabi </LOCATION>, one stop before it disappeared. The man succeeded in his suicide attempt, but the woman survived. South Korean officials believe the couple left bags on the plane that contained a bomb, and suggested they were North Korean agents who blew up the plane as part of a long-range scheme to disrupt the 1988 <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> Summer Olympics. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> called the accusation `` silly and far-fetched.''

 Four Americans are killed when a bomb under a seat explodes on <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> Flight 840 from <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>. Nine other passengers are injured. The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 was beginning its descent into <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> when the bomb blew a gaping hole in the fuselage. Two women, a mother and daughter, and the daughter's baby were killed when they were sucked from the plane and plummeted to the ground. The fourth victim, also found on the ground, was killed instantly when the bomb exploded under his seat. Authorities speculated that the terrorist who set the charge may have been confused by <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s recent shift to daylight-saving time. Had the bomb gone off an hour earlier _ before the jet began its descent _ the massive decompression of the fuselage would have caused a crash killing all 122 people aboard. Police said the explosive device was left under the seat by a woman carrying a Lebanese passport under the name <PERSON> Mei </PERSON> <PERSON> Mansour </PERSON> who sat in the seat earlier, when the plane was westbound. <PERSON> Mansour </PERSON> later appeared in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and denied responsibility.

 <ORGANIZATION> Air-India </ORGANIZATION> Flight 182 blows apart off the coast of <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, killing all 329 people aboard. The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 was on its way from <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION>, via <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. An inquiry by the Indian government concluded that a bomb caused the crash. Canadian authorities said a man checked a suitcase onto the plane but did not board. In another incident the same day, Canadian officials say, <ORGANIZATION> Sikh </ORGANIZATION> militants planted a suitcase bomb on a Canadian jetliner in <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION>. The bag exploded while being transferred to an <ORGANIZATION> Air-India </ORGANIZATION> flight at the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> airport, killing two baggage handlers. Despite circumstantial evidence, police have been unable to prove their contention that extremist Sikhs based in <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> planted the bombs to retaliate for the storming of a Sikh shrine in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> by government troops. Anonymous callers claimed responsibility for the crash on behalf of <ORGANIZATION> Sikh </ORGANIZATION> groups.

 The catastrophic earthquake in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> has dampened the Christmas spirit in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Armenian community, with many festivities canceled and money normally spent on gifts being sent for relief efforts. Armenians in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, as well as in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, have canceled or postponed Christmas and New Year's parties, weddings, dances, tree decorating and other activities to mourn the thousands killed in the Dec. 7 quake. `` The earthquake has pretty much ruined Christmas for most of the Armenians I know,'' said <PERSON> Jean-Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Atamian </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> lawyer who had volunteered to answer phones for the Armenian <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benevolent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Saddle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brook </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> `` We have canceled all of the gatherings and dances and social functions. We felt it would be totally inappropriate.'' The earthquake devastated the cities of <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spitak </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kirovakan </LOCATION> and up to 100 rural settlements in northwest <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. Official Soviet sources have put the death toll as high as 55,000 and estimated the number of homeless at over 500,000. Christmas is celebrated Jan. 6 by the Armenian church and Dec. 25 by Armenian Catholics and Protestants. Leaders of the two branches of the Armenian church in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> declared a 40-day period of mourning when the earthquake hit. But many Armenians say the decision to mute celebrations was spontaneous. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, Archbishop <PERSON> Torkom </PERSON> <PERSON> Manoogian </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diocese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armenian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, will hold a requiem Mass for children Jan. 7 instead of the Christmas party he usually holds for youngsters, according to <PERSON> Adrienne </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexanian </PERSON>, a volunteer at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vartan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armenian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cathedral </ORGANIZATION>. About 70,000 Armenians live in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York-New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> area. In <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, with the largest Armenian population outside the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> _ some 250,000 live in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> area _ Armenians have canceled weddings and holiday parties. Churches are holding special requiem services after Sunday Masses. Armenian Protestants are preparing for a somber holiday. `` Of course we will still observe <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>'s birth,'' said <PERSON> Rosey </PERSON> <PERSON> Maranjian </PERSON>, who answered the telephone for the <ORGANIZATION> Armenian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> at its headquarters in <LOCATION> Paramus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> `` But there is nothing to celebrate even though <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> is born.'' `` We keep asking, ` Why us?''' she said. One of her cousins died in <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION>, she added. `` It's a sad way to celebrate such a joyous event,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Moses </PERSON> <PERSON> Janbazian </PERSON>, the association's executive director. `` Instead of sending out Christmas cards to friends and exchanging gifts, we are sending the money to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. And most families are doing that,'' said <PERSON> Shakeh </PERSON> <PERSON> Kadehjian </PERSON>, a secretary in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> office of the Armenian <ORGANIZATION> Evangelical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, which celebrates Christmas Dec. 25. `` Most of the people, without asking us, are canceling their wedding ceremonies'' until after the mourning period ends Jan. 17, said Rev. <PERSON> Nareg </PERSON> <PERSON> Shrikian </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armenian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Apostolic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Glendale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> `` The first reaction among Armenians was to cancel everything, not even to decorate Christmas trees,'' said <PERSON> Ara </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalaydjian </PERSON>, editor of the Armenian Mirror-Spectator, an English-language newspaper published in <LOCATION> Watertown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. The area is home to 30,000-40 ,000 Armenians <PERSON> Kalaydjian </PERSON> said he planned a quiet dinner with his family. `` We wo n't exchange gifts. We wo n't have a tree,'' he siad. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Bogosian </PERSON>, editor of the Armenian Reporter, said his English-language weekly, published in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, ordinarily carries announcements of holiday events. But over the past two weeks, he said, `` all the listings carried a notation: canceled, canceled, canceled, one after another.''

 Thousands packed into <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s top art gallery for the opening of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s first painting exhibition devoted entirely to the study of nudes. Some leered and shook their heads in disbelief at what they saw, but many others gazed with obvious appreciation at the works. Poets, top government officials, schoolchildren, young couples and workers gathered Thursday around the paintings by some of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s best artists. `` I feel this exhibition shows we have achieved a little more freedom. In the past you would never see this,'' said <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Xing </PERSON>, 22, a student from <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Teacher's College as he viewed a study of a man and a woman touching a bird. `` It also shows our level is rising. The paintings here move me, they are beautiful.'' `` Underneath, everyone is naked and everyone knows their nakedness,'' said Ai Qing, who at 79 is <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s best known living poet. `` Why then, when we want to paint our bodies, do so many <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> think it's strange? I think it is good.'' The Exhibition of Figure Oil Painting at the <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> Art Gallery features 128 paintings by 21 artists. Gallery official estimated that about 20,000 people came on the first day, paying about 27 cents each, five times the normal admission price. `` We have traditional nudes, realistic nudes, expressionist nudes, abstract nudes, even cubist and deformist nudes,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Ge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pengren </ORGANIZATION>, a painting instructor at the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> who organized the show. `` Our purpose is to educate the people about nudes and to show them, through these paintings, how we value life.'' Ge said the exhibition, which was approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Culture </ORGANIZATION> before it was opened, had n't met with any `` major interference'' since it was sanctioned a year ago. `` When we chose the paintings, there was no censorship at all,'' he said. Artistic freedom in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is very limited. Books and movies have to pass through a censor and artists are often restricted in what they can create. During the ultra-leftist Cultural Revolution from 1966-76, painters were banned from displaying nude paintings and only in 1978 were they again allowed to use nude models. Society and the state have been slow in accepting the change. Newspapers carried a report earlier this year about a 19-year-old girl who suffered a nervous breakdown because of the abuse she received for posing nude at the <ORGANIZATION> Nanjing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION>. In recent years, only two exhibitions devoted to nudes have opened in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. In addition, a nude mural by <PERSON> Yuan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yunsheng </PERSON>, painted in 1979 during a period of relative cultural freedom, remains covered at the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. `` In the past, society's ideas about morality were a little backward,'' said Ge. `` It was like we were afraid of our bodies. With this exhibition, we want to open a new road.'' Inded, the educational nature of the exhibition is very strong. A lengthy explanation of the nude's place in art history lines the middle of one hall. A discussion of the artists' work lines another. `` We still have to introduce things to the masses,'' said artist <PERSON> Cao </PERSON> <PERSON> Li </PERSON>. `` Without this introduction, many people would n't understand at all.'' But even with the introduction, <PERSON> Fu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kegan </PERSON> was having a hard time. `` I'm going to stand here until I understand this painting,'' the former teacher said as he stood, head shaking, in front of a gray canvas. `` The artist told me this is an abstract nude,'' said <PERSON> Fu </PERSON>, 68. `` But it looks like a pile of rocks.'' Despite his confusion, <PERSON> Fu </PERSON> said he welcomed such exhibitions. `` We hear that nude exhibitions in the West are normal,'' he said. `` So why in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> should they be so mysterious? This show could teach people that nude painting is n't dangerous.'' `` It may not be dangerous,'' said <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Bing </PERSON>, 48, a housewife. `` But I think it's dirty. Look at those boys staring at that painting.'' Across the room, a pack of 20 men appeared perilously close to diving into a painting of two <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> women. `` Oh, there will always be uneducated people,'' <PERSON> Fu </PERSON> said. `` But maybe this show will teach them to change.''

 The decision by <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government not to alert the public to a fairly specific bomb threat received long before <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 crashed in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> could raise liability problems for the airline but probably not for the government, attorneys say. `` I do n't know of any legal requirement that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> go public on a thing like that other than notifying the airline involved and possibly the embassies,'' said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Kreindler </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> lawyer who specializes in aviation accident cases. `` It's a difficult area, but if the government notifies the airline in question, I think the government position is justified,'' <PERSON> Kreindler </PERSON> said Thursday. <PERSON> Kreindler </PERSON> said there are `` some policy reasons from the government's standpoint for not'' notifying the traveling public. One of the purposes of the Federal Aviation Act is to enhance aviation and an announcement of a specific threat which might not be bona fide could conceivably result in travelers not flying. Flight 103, originating in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, with a change of planes at <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, crashed in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> on Wednesday, killing all 258 people aboard and more than 20 on the ground. It was bound for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, said that an unidentified individual telephoned the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> on Dec. 5 and said there would be a bombing attempt within two weeks against a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> aircraft flying from <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The conduit would be an `` unwitting'' passenger who would take the device from <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> and then board a U.S.-bound flight, she said. It has not been established, however, that the telephoned tip was related to the Pan Am crash. Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said dozens of threats are received each day and all are taken seriously. <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Bremer </PERSON>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s counter-terrorism office, said there have been 87 calls similar to the <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> call over the past three months. But the Dec. 5 call, apparently from a tipster, appeared to be taken more seriously than most others. Many <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassies were apprised of the threat, including the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> mission in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, where a notice of the threat was posted on a bulletin board. No word went out to the general public. The prior notification `` is going to raise an interesting question'' in connection with the other passengers `` who were not members of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> staff whether they should have received similar notice from <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tompkins </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a lawyer specializing in defending airlines in accident cases. <PERSON> Bremer </PERSON> said in an interview Thursday night that not enough is known to conclude that sabotage caused the jumbo jet to crash. `` We do n't know if this is a terrorist attack,'' he said. Asked what an airline's obligation is once it has been notified of a specific threat, <PERSON> Kreindler </PERSON> said, `` It's a tough situation. ... They do n't have to stop operating or stop flying, but certainly they have a duty to meticulously inspect.'' <PERSON> Kreindler </PERSON> said that in some other instances of terrorism involving air travel, evidence-gathering in lawsuits has focused on airline security precautions. Officials said <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> stepped up security at key airports in the wake of the threat. Anyone filing lawsuits seeking settlements in excess of a $ 75,000 limit in international airlines cases would have to show willful misconduct on the part of the airline in order to be successful. <PERSON> Tompkins </PERSON> said willful misconduct is extremely difficult to prove, carrying with it a heavier burden of proof than gross negligence. Willful misconduct is a wrongful act done intentionally or an improper act done wantonly with knowledge of the probable consequences.

 The damage to national security caused by a soldier accused of spying for the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact might not be as severe as originally feared, <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials say. The officials, who insisted on anonymity, said Thursday that continuing interrogation of Warrant Officer <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> `` suggests he might have been selective in the documents he passed.'' `` When all is said and done, it does n't look too bad,'' said one official. `` It's not great, but it's not a crisis, either,'' said another. `` The counter-intelligence people are wringing him out now,'' said one source. `` He's still cooperating, singing.'' Hall, 30, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, was arrested Wednesday at his home near <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stewart </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, by <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> intelligence agents after a successful Army-FBI sting operation. Lt. Col. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapla </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> was moved Thursday from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stewart </LOCATION> to a prison cell at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Meade </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, outside <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> D.C </ORGANIZATION>. According to affidavits filed in federal court in <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Fort </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> is located, <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> bragged to an unidentified <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent `` that he had been passing highly sensitive signal intelligence documents to both the Soviets and the East German intelligence services since late 1982.'' `` Hall boasted of the important signal intelligence information he had passed, and admitted his motivation to be greed,'' the document said. It did not give details on the information. Hall allegedly passed the information through a Turkish-born, naturalized citizen named <PERSON> Huseyin </PERSON> <PERSON> Yildirim </PERSON>. <PERSON> Yildirim </PERSON> also was arrested Wednesday at his home in <LOCATION> Belleair </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION>. He had been scheduled to appear at a bond hearing Thursday but the proceeding was postponed until Tuesday because <PERSON> Yildirim </PERSON>'s attorney had a scheduling conflict <PERSON> Chapla </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> was moved to `` facilitate security,'' noting the base at <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Meade </ORGANIZATION> has `` secure facilities'' that can be used for courts-martial that involve the presentation of classified material as evidence. Fort <PERSON> Meade </PERSON> also is the site of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, the supersecret spy agency that conducts electronic surveillance around the world. Hall worked in the field of electronic surveillance for the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and, indirectly, the <ORGANIZATION> NSA </ORGANIZATION>. The spokesman declined to say whether <ORGANIZATION> NSA </ORGANIZATION> specialists were sitting in on the interrogation of Hall. <PERSON> Chapla </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> not been formally charged with any crimes as of Thursday evening but was being detained under the Uniform Code of Military Justice for suspicion of espionage. He can be held for up to three days on that basis, <PERSON> Chapla </PERSON> said. According to <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> records, <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> held a `` Top Secret'' security clearance and spent most of his 12 years in the service at posts in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> maintains electronic listening posts and intelligence units that would play critical roles in time of war. During his service career, Hall rose in rank to a point where he could have provided `` a detailed and damaging look at our techniques and capabilities when it comes to intercepting radio and voice traffic and breaking codes,'' explained one official. `` But we've got to find out how far he went. He could have kept his handlers happy with less sensitive stuff, too.'' Added an <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> source: `` He was a worker bee. He had familiarity with the techniques and technology of the business of signals intelligence. It's logical to say he could have really hurt us.'' <PERSON> Chapla </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> had been flown on an Army airplane from <PERSON> Fort </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> to <PERSON> Fort </PERSON> <PERSON> Meade </PERSON> on Thursday afternoon and that in the process, legal jurisdiction over the warrant officer was shifted to the commander of the Military District of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. That commander is Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilbert </PERSON>. Should investigators recommend a grand jury-type proceeding and court martial, it will be up to <PERSON> Hilbert </PERSON> to decide how to proceed, <PERSON> Chapla </PERSON> added.

<HEAD>Lowly Rodent Thrust To Forefront Of War On AIDS</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Researchers have infected mice with the AIDS virus for the first time, moving the lowly rodent to the front lines of the battle against the fatal disease. Mice have long been a staple of biomedical research, but until scientists in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> were able to develop mice with human immune systems _ and then get the AIDS virus to spread in them _ the animals had been largely useless in AIDS research. The main breakthrough _ getting a human immune system to function in mice _ has had scientists excited since the work was reported in Science magazine in September. The current issue of the magazine, out today, contains an updated report from the same <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> researchers confirming their assumption that they would be able to get the AIDS virus _ HIV _ to `` take'' in their special mice. Mice with standard immune systems are impervious to the AIDS virus. In another report in Science, scientists at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> provided additional information on their previously reported success in producing mice that carry the genetic code for the AIDS virus in every cell of their bodies. A third paper is on the work of scientists at the Hospital for Sick Children in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, who have transplanted human bone marrow into mice with human-like immune systems. That research is geared toward studying such blood diseases as leukemia and sickle cell anemia. As previously reported, the human immune system was developed in mice by transplanting liver, thymus, spleen and lymph node cells from aborted human fetuses into them. The significance of all three reports is not in what has been learned thus far about AIDS or any other specific disease, but rather the demonstrated ability to use mice in new ways. For example, the <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> scientists purposely limited the scope of their initial efforts to infect mice with AIDS to observing them for no more than eight weeks, too short to lead to full-blown AIDS, but enough to show researchers the virus would flourish in their new breed of mice. `` By limiting the study to eight weeks, we can not yet predict whether the mice would get the full AIDS syndrome,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> <PERSON> Weissman </PERSON>, one of the Stanford researchers. `` It's too early to tell. This experiment was n't designed to mimic AIDS in human patients exactly.'' In a twist of irony, 127 of the 130 the special `` AIDS-coded'' mice developed at NIHealth died in a freak accident earlier this month, when the ventalition system in the building housing them was cut off too long during repairs. Although it will take four to five months to replenish the <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> herd, <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fauci </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Allergy </ORGANIZATION> and Infectious Disease said they `` are expected to be valuable not only for better understanding of HIV effects on tissue, but also for testing of therapeutics to prevent HIV-induced disease.'' In the <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> work, complete copies of the AIDS virus DNA were injected into fertilized mouse eggs that subsequently were implanted into adult female mice. Of the 64 mice born, researchers identified seven `` founder mice'' that contained complete copies of the AIDS virus DNA in their chromosomes and subsequently transmitted the copies to their offspring. Dr. <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> team, said the accident was made worse by the fact that none of the `` founder mice'' was among the three survivors.

 A predawn <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON> <PERSON> Loggins </PERSON> concert for Japanese television drew a `` lynch mob'' of pajama-clad residents to the stage after they were awakened by the big beat of the unauthorized show, police said. `` Our switchboard lit up like the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree,'' said Police Lt. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>. Complaints began coming in shortly before 5 a.m. Wednesday. The show was set for prime time in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, just before 10 p.m. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said the show from the steps of the historic Old Mission did not have the city's permission, and when officers arrived they found a wooden stage full of rock musicians, speakers, electrical generators, lights and cameras plus a production crew of 75. The singer-songwriter later left without being reached for comment. Police shut the show down despite protests from the producer, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Okumura </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, who said he would lose millions of dollars, according to <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>. Officials said permits he had requested via facsimile machine a few hours before the show claimed it would be `` low volume.'' Some officers had to hold back angry neighborhood residents, many of whom came to the scene in their nightclothes. `` Understandably, it resembled a lynch mob,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. The Rev. <PERSON> Virgil </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordano </PERSON> of the Mission said he had been told the production would be quiet, and he granted permission for use of the building as a backdrop because `` it was good for <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION> and good for the Mission.'' `` I thought I was doing the city of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION> a favor and spreading the good news to <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>,'' he said.

 Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> gave President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> some early praise in his first interview since losing the election, and said he was still `` decompressing'' from the campaign and would n't want to replay it. `` There's not much sense in rerunning the campaign,'' the defeated <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidate told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday. `` I mean, we did some things well, we did other things not so well. It was n't successful. Obviously, I'm disappointed. Lots of people are disappointed. We worked very hard. But I do n't think it's something to dwell on. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> declined an opportunity to criticize <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, whom he had lambasted during a bitter campaign, saying he would give the president-elect `` a good six months to a year'' before speaking out. However, the governor, who attacked President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s policy in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> during the campaign, said he was pleased by reports that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has decided not to ask <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> immediately for renewed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for the rightist Contra rebels in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> hopes to forge a bipartisan consensus and involve Latin leaders. `` I think it's the right policy,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` When I met with him I strongly urged him to do that. I said I think the present policy is a failure, it's getting worse not better.'' `` If that's the way the new administration begins, then I think that's hopeful,'' the governor said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who held one press conference immediately after his loss to assess the campaign, refused to review the campaign in detail, saying he preferred to focus on the future. But he also declined to tip his hand about any plans he may have for his own career after his current term as governor ends in 1990. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has refused previously to say whether he would run for president again. `` It's much too early. At this point, I'm decompressing, working hard on what's happening here, enjoying a certain amount of normalcy in my life,'' he said. Seated in his <ORGANIZATION> Statehouse </ORGANIZATION> office after a week's vacation in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> appeared relaxed and reflective, more interested in his state's budget problems than in the national agenda he was pushing before losing to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> 54 percent to 46 percent just six weeks ago. `` It's been quite a year. And I must say it's nice to reflect a little bit on the blessings of life, welcome my crew home and to play the role of father and husband, and enjoy and relax a little bit,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. Asked if he ever has days when he wishes he could have another shot at the campaign, or even another week to battle <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said no. `` At some point, there has to be a conclusion. You work hard to that day, then people go and vote. Certainly, nobody ever suggested <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> presidential campaigns are too short. Twenty months is a long time.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who had never waged a national political campaign before, said his biggest surprise was the change that overtook him immediately after the Democratic National Convention in July. `` I think the one thing that you never quite experience until you experience it is the post-convention period _ when, unfortunately, you are kind of walled off from citizens, communities. ... `` Everything you do is a kind of massive public event. I found that difficult, frustrating. I do n't think it's good. But it is the presidency and the most important political office there is, and that's the reality,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. The governor said the process could be improved. `` But at this point,'' he said, `` I do n't have any brilliant ideas for changing it.'' Asked to evaluate <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s initial appointments and policy statements, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said it's too soon to draw conclusions. `` A new president deserves a chance to put a team together and get under way. Everything is n't going to be perfect; there will be bumps along the way,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` These are all things that had been deferred, swept under the rug _ this kind of thing. He's got to deal with them,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said.

The busy reporters might as well have attended <PERSON> Maksoud </PERSON>'s report over lunch on developments this year in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and expectations for 1989. By day's end it was not clear exactly what caused the jet to crash. Many experts believe there was an explosion on the plane, and among them there is widespread suspicion of sabotage. But the cause could have been heavy winds, said <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Bremer </PERSON>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s office of counterterrorism. `` We do n't know if this is a terrorist attack.'' Nonetheless, terrorism is in the news again. Just last week, the issue dominated the headlines and telecasts in what may yet prove to be a positive turn of events. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> decided to open a `` substantive dialogue'' with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> based on a judgment that Chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> had renounced terrorism. No one is making the suggestion, publicly or privately, that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> had anything to do with the crash in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. But the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration thought it had reached a milestone in the struggle against terrorism. The head of a group Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> had only recently accused of terrorism said the magic words. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, condemned by <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> as an `` accessory,'' suddenly qualified _ by renouncing terrorism and recognizing <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> _ for the semi-recognition that a `` substantive dialogue'' implies. But with the victory came a burden _ for <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> and for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in judging the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. Each incident will be scrutnized for evidence of complicity, to see if his renunciation of terrorism `` in all forms'' will hold up. The first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> session with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> was held last Friday in <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>. Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> warned the next day that it would be the last if terrorism traceable to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> recurred. The warning was echoed by other top <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials. <PERSON> Maksoud </PERSON>, who considers the dialogue long overdue, detected `` lingering hangups'' in the warnings. He said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials were `` a little bit on the defensive unnecessarily ... as if they've done something wrong but necessary. <PERSON> Maksoud </PERSON>, a seasoned observer, sees the U.S.-PLO talks as neither the `` breakthrough'' claimed in some Arab quarters or the threat perceived by some Israelis and their supporters. To him, the expressions of anxiety are `` contrived paranoia'' designed to influence the outgoing <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and incoming <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administrations. And yet, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials will be watching the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> very closely to see if <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s renunciation of terrorism _ with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> prompting _ holds up. That could influence whether the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration tries to persuade <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to negotiate with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> or lends <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support to the idea of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state. There are problems in keeping watch, however. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> is a loosely-knit organization. It is not clear that <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> will or can exercise control over all factions. Nor is it clear how much support his statement has within the group. Moreover, defining terrorism has always been elusive. Last Sunday, <PERSON> Salah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalaf </PERSON>, who is second-in-command to <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> in <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION>, the mainstream <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> faction, said the chairman's ` ` denunciation of terrorism in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> did not include military attacks against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> <PERSON> Khalaf </PERSON>, known also as <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Iyad </PERSON>, added: `` Our struggle will continue until we raise the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> flag over <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>.'' On Monday, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s executive committee said <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> had expressed only his `` personal opinion'' in renouncing terrorism and recognizing <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist. In fact, <PERSON> Mustafa </PERSON> <PERSON> el-Zibri </PERSON> said, the statements were `` incompatible with the resolutions of the latest <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> meeting.'' The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had detected some positive movement at the Council meeting, but no turnabout in the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s stance.

<HEAD>Bush Says He Shares Reagan's View On Libyan Chemical Plant</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says he shares President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s determination to prevent a huge Libyan chemical weapons factory from being used `` to spread further destruction'' but will not go into detail about means of doing so. Answering reporters' questions after announcing his latest <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> appoinments Thursday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he thought the matter should be discussed at an international conference on chemical weapons, set for Jan. 6 in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. `` One should n't give up on trying to turn around the Libyan regime,'' he said. `` But what happens beyond that, if there is a direct refusal to do that, what ... the free world, and I think that most of the world, frankly, would mandate, then we'll consider options at that time.'' Asked specifically whether he shared the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's commitment to preventing the spread of chemical weapons by <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, he said that `` not only should our administration be committed to that, but in my view, any civilized country around the world should be committed to that objective. `` And in terms of what means one uses to achieve that end, I think it would be inappropriate to go into detail,'' he said. `` It does seem to me that our allies can help ... and, yes, we all ought to be committed to seeing that that plant not ... spread further destruction.'' Meanwhile <PERSON> Clovis </PERSON> <PERSON> Maksoud </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>'s representative in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said it was `` not true'' that <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> was producing chemical weapons. `` This atmosphere of creating a focus on <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> as a scapegoat may be an attempt, directly or indirectly, by the Israelis to shift from the central challenge of the peace offensive that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- and the Arabs are undertaking,'' <PERSON> Maksoud </PERSON> told reporters. He said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> accusation `` might give a prior pretext for those who want to strike at an Arab country in order to prevent the maturing of the moderating developments that are taking place in the Arab world as a result primarily of the Arab-PLO dialogue.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, in an interview broadcast Thursday evening on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>, said military action against the <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> site has been discussed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its allies, but `` that's a decision that has not been made yet.'' The portion of the interview containing the remark was included in the network's Wednesday night newscast. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, asked about the president's remark, said, ` The president was quite clear that military action is an option. We're not ruling it out.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` is extremely concerned about production facilities in <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> ... which we believe can produce enormous quantities of chemical weapons,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. Asked whether a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> strike against the facility is under consideration, the spokesman said, `` I'm not saying it's our intention. ... We will not rule out options.''

 The <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> military has denied responsibility for issuing Christmas cards that suggest recipients should spend the season of peace killing Communist rebels. The cards, which have been circulating in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, feature the following message on the front: `` On Christmas Day, do n't sit around the tree.'' Inside the card it reads, `` Kill an <ORGANIZATION> NPA </ORGANIZATION> rebel,'' referring to the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>DOT Rules Logan Airport Landing Fee Plan Discriminatory, Court
Fight Vowed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The operators of <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> are vowing to challenge in court a government order that rejects a new landing fee system designed to cut traffic at the congested <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> airfield by discouraging small planes. The <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> ruled Thursday that <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION>'s landing fee structure, which had been closely watched by the aviation community as a possible national precedent, was unreasonable, discriminatory and in violation of federal law. Deputy Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Mimi </PERSON> <PERSON> Weyforth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dawson </PERSON> signed an order that gives the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Port </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> seven days to rescind its fee structure or lose eligibility for $ 10.2 million in federal aviation improvement grants for the current fiscal year. <ORGANIZATION> MassPort </ORGANIZATION> officials immediately attacked the ruling. `` It sounds like the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> has really just given in to political pressure from powerful special interest groups and turned its back on millions of air travelers in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and throughout the nation,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Champion </PERSON>, assistant to the executive director at <ORGANIZATION> MassPort </ORGANIZATION>. But opponents of the <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION> plan hailed the ruling as a victory for commuter air passengers, private plane pilots and small-town <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` This is a tremendous victory for greater public access to our major airports,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Silvio </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Conte </PERSON>, R-Mass., author of the law that authorized the cutoff of federal funds to <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION> if the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> agreed that the landing fees were unfair Operators of other major airports, including those in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, were awaiting the decision to see if the stiff fee structure could be used as a model in their own battles to reduce air traffic, said Rep. <PERSON> Sherwood </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boehlert </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, a leading congressional opponent of the landing fee plan. Small commuter airlines and private plane owners vehemently fought against the proposal, saying it would lock them out of <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION> and deprive air service to passengers in small communities where there is no access to major airlines. Under <PERSON> Logan </PERSON>'s revised fee structure, large jets are paying significantly less than before, while small aircraft had their landing fees increase from $ 25 to more than $ 100. <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION> officials defended the new fee structure, which went into effect in July after a federal district judge in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> ruled that the fees were not discriminatory. Champion said the landing fee plan had succeeded in reducing congestion at <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION>, which is the largest airport in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, and that access had not been restricted for commuters. The new fee structure was based on a combination of airplanes' weight and other operating costs The original fee rate charged planes a minimum of $ 25 or $ 1.31 per 1,000 pounds, which ever was greater. Most small planes paid $ 25. Under the revised fee structure, which was increased again in October, all planes are assessed a $ 103 flat fee plus 55 cents per 1,000 pounds. <ORGANIZATION> MassPort </ORGANIZATION> Executive Director <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said fees for a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747, which had ranged up to $ 800, have been cut roughly in half under the new fee structure while the landing fee for a <ORGANIZATION> Cessna </ORGANIZATION> 402 seating 10 passengers jumped from $ 25 to about $ 105.

<HEAD>Official Questions ``Fairness Opinions'' to Company Stockholders</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> has questioned the independence of financial advisers who tell stockholders a proposed leveraged buyout of their company is a good deal. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel Thursday that experts who write `` fairness opinions'' often get higher fees if the deal goes through. The opinions offer conclusions on the fairness of a buyout offer. Asked by Rep. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Synar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., whether fairness opinions were independent, <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> said, `` All in all, I am quite suspicious in a significant number of cases, that the fairness opinion is prepared by somebody with an incentive to go along with management `` Personally, I think that needs to be addressed.'' <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> said he was giving the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> telecommunications and finance subcommittee his personal opinion _ not that of the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>, which is currently reviewing all aspects of leveraged buyouts. Leveraged buyouts occur when investors borrow heavily to buy out a company and then pay off the debt with that company's cash flow or by the sale of its assets. <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> said the commission wants to determine whether it should issue new rules to protect investors, and predicted the review would continue at least through February. Fairness opinions are primary factors in the transactions, <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> said, because `` shareholders accord a great degree of weight to the fact that a favorable opinion has been issued.'' The opinions usually attest that the price offered for shares of a company is a fair one. The hired financial adviser must rely almost exclusively on the limited information that management supplies about the company. Subcommittee Chairman <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, D-Mass., said an investment bank may receive $ 1 million to prepare the opinion, but $ 1.5 million if the deal goes through `` It sounds a little bit like a kickback to outsiders,'' <PERSON> Markey </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s selection of <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> as <ORGANIZATION> interior </ORGANIZATION> secretary surprised almost everybody, because the veteran <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> congressman said earlier this month he would n't take the job if it were offered. <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON>, 60, is a Republican who announced in January he was retiring from the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> after 10 terms because wife `` <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> and I thought it was time to come home.'' He changed his mind even after specifically declaring himself out of the running for the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> post. <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> told reporters earlier this month that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> transition aide <PERSON> Chase </PERSON> <PERSON> Untermeyer </PERSON> had asked him if he would take the job, and `` I told him I would not. I said I really did n't want to go back into government, but I might be willing to serve on a board or something like that.'' Reaction to the appointment was mixed. `` It's a solid choice. He's better than most of the names we've been hearing,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Pritchard </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a frequent critic of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration `` He will work well with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, and he knows where the bodies are buried,'' <PERSON> Pritchard </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Audubon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` I have the same heavy feeling in my heart that I did eight years ago'' when <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Watt </PERSON> was appointed to the post by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> was a defender of <PERSON> Watt </PERSON> during his controversial tenure. `` We feel as if we had just been given a lump of coal,'' said <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, president of Friends of the Earth. A fiscally conservative mainstream Republican from a prominent <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> Hispanic political family, <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> was the second-ranking <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Insular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. He has devoted most of his time recently to the Science, <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, where he was the senior Republican. Because of his withdrawal, <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> had hardly figured in speculation for the slot, and was not on a list of four `` acceptable'' names submitted to the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> transition team by Western Republican senators. The choice could be a signal that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is serious about new energy development _ <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> was a sponsor of the principal bill in the last session that would have opened the <ORGANIZATION> Arctic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refuge </ORGANIZATION> to oil exploration. Environmentalists have strongly opposed exploration in that area, on <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s North Slope 65 miles east of the existing fields at <LOCATION> Prudhoe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> took no action on the issue. The League of Conservation Voters awarded <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> a low score, 13 out of a possible 100. <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> voted according to the `` environmentalist'' position only twice out of 16 test votes. However, <PERSON> Pritchard </PERSON> said <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> had been responsive to concerns about parks and historic preservation. The Wilderness Society expressed a split view, saying in a statement by Vice President <PERSON> Sydney </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> that though they differed on <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> oil development, <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> `` has been accessible to the conservation community.'' Rep. <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON>, D-Calif., who has led the so-far successful fight to ban oil exploration in federal waters off central and northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> `` has not stood in the way of measures to protect the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> coast'' and `` will bring an open mind to the issue. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> hailed <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> as `` clearly a friend of business'' with an 80 percent favorable voting record, according to the chamber's tabulation. <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON>, who now lives in <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>, is a 1950 graduate of the College of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION>, where he grew up and where his father served as mayor in the 1940s. He will be the second Hispanic in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> Cabinet. Education Secretary <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> has been asked by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to stay on. `` I went to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to balance the budget and we still have n't done it,'' <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> once said when asked to name his biggest disappointment In 1986, he suffered a heart attack and underwent a triple bypass operation, but in January he said he was not leaving <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> because of ill health _ rather, `` It was always my fear that I would stay too long and not have my health.''

 <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>, President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s choice to head the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, is a former land use planner who has spent 15 years leading a foundation that tries to solve environmental conflicts through consensus. <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>, who turns 49 on Jan. 26, is president of the <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> and of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> affiliate of the World Wildlife Fund, two organizations whose merger he engineered in 1985. The Wildlife Fund has concentrated on preservation of wildlife and habitat in the tropics, urging reversal of worldwide deforestation that is clearing total acreage the size of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> each year. The Conservation Foundation, which <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> took over in 1973, is a research group that has sponsored several convocations of industry and environmentalists to try to resolve particular local issues. Unlike many <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> environmental groups, it does not lobby or file lawsuits. The fund has been the nation's fastest-growing environmental organization in recent years, tripling its membership to 500,000 since 1985. During <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s announcement ceremony Thursday, <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> said he believed he was the first head of such an organization chosen to run the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>, and he pledged a `` new and constructive course'' on environmental problems at home and around the world. In a recent interview, <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> attributed his organization's growth to the response to active solicitation among a population exposed to a steady diet of nature programs on television `` The public watches enormous amounts of nature films,'' <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> said. `` I worry about saturation, but people who know about these things tell me not to.'' And, he said, `` The people who elected <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> are worried about the international environment.'' <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> has paid particular attention to the `` greenhouse effect'' _ the global warming predicted to result from the use of fossil fuels. Unlike many environmentalists, he has not ruled out nuclear power as a benign energy source, and he was considering the formation of another all-viewpoints study group on nuclear power. He serves on the board of several non-pofit organizations and of <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utilities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. He said he believed environmentalists were coming to `` two new awarenessess,'' that `` the environment is much less under control than we believed'' and `` the degree to which we appear to be hostage to other countries for our health and well-being.'' Though no defender of controversial former <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Watt </PERSON>, he said <PERSON> Watt </PERSON>'s $ 1 billion, four-year renovation of national park structures `` made a lot of sense'' but `` natural systems did n't get the same kind of attention.'' On the parks, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration `` has got to take the external threats issue seriously. That's a tough issue for a conservative administration.'' Park advocates have complained that threats of development up against park boundaries are spoiling many parks. <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> has enjoyed the confidence of the outgoing administrator of <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>' predecessor, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruckelshaus </PERSON>, who turned to the foundation for several studies. During the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, the foundation has produced three major `` state of the environment'' documents and, among other things, major studies of groundwater contamination and national parks. Before that, it was a pioneer in calling attention to the dangers of excessive use of pesticides. In 1984, the foundation helped organize <ORGANIZATION> Clean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sites </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which organizes cleanup of toxic waste by polluting companies themselves. Clean Sites was begun with chemical industry money but now gets two-thirds of its funds elsewhere. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> backed a major study of wetlands by the foundation and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which recommended last month a goal of creating enough new wetlands to more than offset the loss of bogs, swamps, fens, marshes and estuaries to development. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has endorsed the `` no net loss'' goal. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> turned to <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> this fall to organize a study of the Superfund toxic waste cleanup program that would bring industry and environmentalists together. The environmentalists, however, objected that the study could be a cover for weakening the program and declined to participate. <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> is a protege of former <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> administrator <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Train </PERSON>, for whom he worked on the staff of the White House Council on Environmental Quality in 1970-1972. Train is now chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> affiliate and of the <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. Train was an adviser to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on environmental issues and solicited support for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> among environmentalists. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> hailed <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>'s selection as being `` truly outstanding.'' <PERSON> Ruckelshaus </PERSON> said, `` The country, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, the people of <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> and our environment will all be better off.'' `` This is a positive signal from the president-elect that he intends to carry out his campaign commitments to environmental protection,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. A graduate of <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> who holds a law degree from <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> and a master's degree in planning from <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> Decatur </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, spent his childhood nearby and went to high school in <LOCATION> Fall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. After college graduation in 1962, he served in the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, practiced law in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, attended graduate scool and served as associate director of the <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> before joining the Council on Environmental Quality.

<HEAD>Freezing Deaths On The Rise In U.S., CDC Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Homelessness and inadequate home heating are factors in the jump in the number of freezing deaths in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which has more than doubled in a decade, federal officials say. The national <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday that in 1985, the latest year for which complete statistics are available, 1,010 people died from exposure to the cold, a 137 percent increase from the 427 deaths reported in 1976. More research needs to be done, but the numbers strongly suggest more and more Americans are dying from the cold, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said. The vast majority of the deaths were technically due to hypothermia _ decreased body temperature, or freezing to death. `` It's either increased cold ... which is unlikely, or it's more people exposed to more intense or more frequent stresses from the cold,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Kilbourne </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> researcher. <PERSON> Kilbourne </PERSON> said that while it's possible that many of the deaths were due to inadequate home heating, another part of the problem is the significant number of people who have no shelter at all to call their own. `` A person who has to sleep outdoors, they certainly run a higher risk of problems like hypothermia,'' he said. Social service officials have said the number of homeless people has risen in recent years. Estimates of the number nationwide are as high as 3 million. As the nation ages, <PERSON> Kilbourne </PERSON> said, more research is needed to determine just who is freezing to death: homeless people _ typically middle-aged men _ who have no shelter from the cold, or older people less able to withstand low temperatures and possibly living with insufficient heat. `` In the past, at least in certain cases, hypothermia has been thought of as a problem of middle-aged male alcoholics ... a ` street person.' We really do n't know if that remains the profile,'' <PERSON> Kilbourne </PERSON> said. People 60 and older are particularly susceptible to hypothermia, and account for more than half of all hypothermia deaths, according to previous studies. Children under a year old also are at high risk, although hypothermia deaths are rare in children. `` Hypothermia prevention programs should focus on persons particularly susceptible ... and those likely to be subjected to unusual cold stress,'' the Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said in its weekly report. The agency said special attention should be paid to proper nutrition and home heating for the elderly, shelter for the homeless and precautions for young people in the outdoors, such as skiers and hikers.

<TEXT>
 Dr. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, named to head the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, leads one of three predominantly black medical schools in the nation and is a longtime advocate of improved health care for disadvantaged Americans. In selecting <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> on Thursday, President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> fulfilled his pledge to name a black to his Cabinet. But the much-anticipated nomination was assured only after <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> quelled a last-minute outcry from anti-abortion forces. Their objections were triggered by an <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> newspaper interview Sunday in which <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said he supports a woman's right to seek an abortion, though he opposes federal assistance for it. On Monday, <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> wrote a letter to <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> and The Atlanta Constitution saying he is `` opposed to abortion except in cases of rape, incest and where the life of the mother is threatened'' _ a statement mirroring <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s views and one which he repeated at the President-elect's side in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Thursday. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> also declared that the `` nation must address the disparity that exists in the availability and quality of health care'' for Americans of differing economic means. Similarly, <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> had set as the `` abiding goal'' of his institution the training of doctors willing to establish family practices in rural and inner-city areas. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, 55, a blood specialist, has been president of the <ORGANIZATION> Morehouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> since it became independent from <ORGANIZATION> Morehouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in 1981. He has taught medicine at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Morehouse </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, where he graduated with honors in 1958. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> returned to BU as an assistant medical professor in 1966. While there, he distinguished himself as a hematologist and implemented the first minority recruiting program at the school. `` Doctor <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> is an unusually able physician and administrator,'' said <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Gloster </PERSON>, retired president of <ORGANIZATION> Morehouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, who hired <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>. `` He tends to delegate but he handles the important things himself. He makes the big presentations.'' He described <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> as a charismatic man whose selection to head the school was the result of an extensive national search. `` I doubt if there is anyone better qualified,'' he said. At <LOCATION> Morehouse </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> oversees a faculty and staff of about 100 and currently has no teaching assignments. The medical school separated from <ORGANIZATION> Morehouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in 1981 when it began offering graduate degrees. Its new campus was dedicated in 1982 in a ceremony attended by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, whose wife, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>, was named to the medical school's board of trustees in 1983. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> accompanied the Bushes during a trip to <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in 1982. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> has written or co-written more than 60 technical articles, mostly dealing with blood chemistry and diseases. He has directed national research on sickle cell anemia, a fatal blood disease that primarily affects blacks. The <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> native is a former president of the <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minority </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Professions </ORGANIZATION>, and has often expressed concern over the low number of minorities entering medicine. At the same time, he has said that <ORGANIZATION> Morehouse </ORGANIZATION>, while heavily black, welcomes white students, especially those willing to practice medicine in rural or urban poor areas. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, a 1954 honors graduate of <ORGANIZATION> Morehouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> and a graduate of the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, and his wife, Ginger, have three children. He is active in the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, and serves on the National Executive Board of the Boy Scouts of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON>, a surprise nominee to become the first secretary of the new <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>, is a former long-time <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> congressman who lost his seat at the hands of redistricting. <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON>'s selection Thursday by President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> surprised advocates for veterans groups and those who deal with veterans issues in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> because he has dealt little with issues of concern to veterans. `` I'll admit it was a surprise to me,'' said Rep. G.V. <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>, D-Miss., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> `` His name had never even surfaced.'' One congressional aide described the <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> reaction as a `` giant shock.'' <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON>, 62, did not serve on veterans committees in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, and since then he has worked at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. However, initial reaction among veterans and their advocates was supportive. `` I think he'll be a strong and balanced advocate to be sure veterans get their share of whatever pie is available for allocation,'' said Gen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stilwell </PERSON>, a retired <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> officer who served as deputy undersecretary of defense in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>, who successfully pushed legislation to upgrade the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> to a Cabinet level department, called him `` a fine choice.'' `` He has a great wit that will be an asset as he tackles this tough new job,'' <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> said. `` A number of us who sponsored the Cabinet-level job were looking for a strong spokesman for veterans. I believe we have the right person in <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legion </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> has spoken twice to Legion meetings on international issues. `` We've worked with him before,'' <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> said. `` He's been friendly and we look forward to seeing him again,.'' <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> has been undersecretary of state for security assistance, science and technology, a post he assumed in April 1987. He was named counselor of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in 1983 after leaving <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, and served as a special adviser to the secretary of state. In those jobs he has been in charge of <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> dealings with the transfers of arms and sensitive technology. As the department's international sports coordinator, he worked with Korean authorities on security arrangements at the <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> Olympics this year. In <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> was known for his trademark crew cut and loud sportcoats, and for his puckish humor. At the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION>, he will head a huge bureacuracy with 240,000 employees, a budget of more than $ 10 billion and the largest hospital system in the nation. The <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> has undergone serious financial difficulties as a result of budget constraints at a time when more veterans are becoming elderly and are in need of care at <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> hospitals, nursing homes and other medical facilities. The current administrator, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Turnage </PERSON>, has come under fire in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> as a result of cutbacks in hospital care. Critics have faulted him for failing to aggressively seek larger budget appropriation requests within the administration. In hearings earlier this year, <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>'s committee heard testimony that 8,000 to 10,000 of the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION>'s 72,000 beds had been put out of service because of money problems. `` It's not going to be an easy job because at the start of the new <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> we're going to have to seek additional funds,'' <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> said. `` We're turning away patients now. We just never have gotten enough money to run them. He's got his work cut out for him.'' <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> native, served in the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> during World War II. He was a member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> from 1959 to 1983 from <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>' 4th Congressional District. He served on the Foreign Affairs and <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> committees. <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON>'s district was combined with that of another <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> congressman, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>, in reapportionment after the 1980 census. The two opposed each other in a Republican primary, and <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> lost. He served in the state legislature before being elected to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, and in 1964 was state chairman of <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON>'s Republican presidential campaign Rep. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, R-Ill., said <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> was `` always voluably anticommunist. Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Madigan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>., said <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON>, who is of Polish ancestry, was active and popular with ethnic Republican organizations

<HEAD>Spain's Taste For American Food Boosts U.S. Imports</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> has turned into one of the American farmer's richest overseas markets, but <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> trade analysts say the character of those shipments are changing rapidly. For example, since the entry of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> into the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> in 1986, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports of wheat and feed grains have fallen dramatically, says the department's <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. But other kinds of products, including many high-value items, have taken up much of the slack. In the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, the total value of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farm exports to <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> was $ 848 million, up 30 percent from $ 652 million in 1986-87. An important factor is the thriving <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> economy, which has helped create new and expanded demand for processed or semi-processed foods that carry higher price tags than the traditional bulk commodities. <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s gross national product, or the sum of its goods and services, grew 5.5 percent in 1987, the highest in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, and is expected to gain nearly that much in 1988, the agency said Thursday in a report. `` However, at more than 19 percent, unemployment remains the country's most compelling economic and social problem,'' the report added. The surge last fiscal year put <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> among the world's top 10 markets for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agricultural exports. Leading commodities included: soybeans and soybean meal, corn and corn gluten feed, tallow, hides, skins, walnuts, peas, beans, lentils, seeds, yellow grease, prunes and poultry meat. Further, the report said, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> supplied all of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s imported almonds and half of its imported cattle semen. `` Increasing disposable income, a more urban and youthful population and larger numbers of working women have resulted in greater interest in convenience items, fast foods and more eating outside the home,'' the report said. `` Patronage of restaurants traditionally is high.'' The report added: `` Although the standard three-hour business lunch endures, consumption of fast foods and snacks is increasing. Numerous tourists and the growing number of Spaniards who have traveled abroad tend to encourage greater interest in new food ideas.'' As an <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> member, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s food processing industry has become a prime takeover target for investment by many kinds of multinational companies, and this shows little sign of subsiding, the report said. Meanwhile, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> makes up an important part of the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>'s total market for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agricultural products. Last fiscal year, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> shipments to the 12-nation trading bloc totaled $ 7.5 billion, with <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> accounting for more than 11 percent. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> was the second-largest market -LRB- and the biggest for a single country -RRB-, with $ 7.3 billion in 1987-88. Others in the top 10 included: <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, $ 2.3 billion; <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, $ 2 billion; <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, $ 1.9 billion; <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, $ 1.7 billion; <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, $ 1.6 billion; <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, $ 800 million; <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, $ 700 million; and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, $ 600 million.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> have added 1.4 million metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain to their 1989 granaries, including wheat sold to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> at subsidized prices. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s order announced Thursday was for an additional 1 million metric tons of corn for delivery under a recently extended supply agreement between the two countries. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> bought 400,000 tons of wheat under the subsidy program. The latest sales by private exporting companies brought total corn sold to the Soviets to almost 8.03 million tons in the agreement's sixth year, which began Oct. 1. Last year, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn sales to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> totaled slightly less than 5.2 million tons. Exporters are required to report foreign grain sales of 100,000 tons or more to the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> within 24 hours. Smaller sales are reported weekly. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 1 million tons of corn would be about 39.4 million bushels. Corn prices have been averaging about $ 2.61 per bushel at the farm level, according to <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> estimates, meaning that the latest sale could have a farm value of around $ 103 million. Although no wheat has yet been sold for 1988-89 delivery under the pact, the Soviets have ordered 500,000 tons of soybeans and 532,500 tons of soybean meal, plus 500,000 tons of grain sorghum. <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sims </PERSON>, general sales manager for the department's <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said seven export companies were involved in the sale of 400,000 tons of wheat to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, some 14.7 million bushels having an estimated farm value of $ 58 million at recent prices The companies included: <ORGANIZATION> Cargill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, 90,000 tons; <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION>, 40,000 tons; <ORGANIZATION> Nissho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iwai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, 30,000 tons; <ORGANIZATION> Bunge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, 40,000 tons; <ORGANIZATION> Tradigrain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, 50,000 tons; <ORGANIZATION> Tradecom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, 30,000 tons; and <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dreyfus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, 120,000 tons. <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> said the sales were part of an authorized 1 million tons of wheat announced on Dec. 7 under the Export Enhancement Program, or EEP. With the latest sales, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> now has 210,000 tons remaining under the authorization. The program enables exporters to sell wheat and other designated commodities to specified countries at reduced prices in order to meet foreign competition. The exporters then collect free government surpluses of grain or other products as bonuses, or subsidies. <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> said the bonuses due the seven exporters for the latest deal averaged $ 23.10 per ton of wheat, or about 63 cents per bushel.

 A small Christmas tree sits in <PERSON> Georgette </PERSON> <PERSON> Shatara </PERSON>'s living room, but she says there will be no <LOCATION> turkey </LOCATION> dinner this year, let alone the whole roast sheep that marked holdays past. `` You see the tree?'' she asked. `` I did it for my youngest. He begged and begged.'' But Mrs. <PERSON> Shatara </PERSON> had to tell 8-year-old <PERSON> Khader </PERSON>, who sat nearby, that this year <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION> will not visit the family's one-story stone house in the town where the Bible says <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> was born. One year after the Palestinian uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> rule, many <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> families like the Shataras do not have the money or the spirit for a traditional Christmas celebration. Shortened daily working hours and weekly general strikes have hit the economy hard. Violence has taken the lives of 333 Palestinians and 14 Israelis. More than 20,000 Arabs have been jailed since the uprising started last December and at least 5,600 remain in custody. Leaders of the uprising have declared a general strike for Saturday, on Christmas Eve, when Palestinian Christians used to crowd into Manger Square with thousands of tourists to watch the parade that led religious leaders to the Church of the Nativity. About 35,000 Palestinian Christians live in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, occupied by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> since the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. Most are concentrated in <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, nearby <LOCATION> Beit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jalah </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Beit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahur </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION> north of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. The Shataras, Roman Catholics, used to celebrate Christmas by going to midnight Mass, then having a Christmas dinner with as many as 50 relatives. The traditional menu included turkey, a roast sheep, stuffed zucchini and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> sweets. This year, dinner will be for just Mrs. <PERSON> Shatara </PERSON>, her husband, <PERSON> Issa </PERSON>, and their six children. It will be `` nothing special,'' she said. The 38-year-old Mrs. <PERSON> Shatara </PERSON> says the reason for a quiet Christmas is obvious: `` Lots have been killed, many others arrested. There's no work, no money. There's no reason for Christmas.'' She says her husband, 48, is a waiter in a restaurant in Arab east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and brings home only about 10 shekels -LRB- $ 6 -RRB- a day since there are few diners and few tips. Her oldest son, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>, 19, quit high school to try to supplement the family income, but has found no steady work. `` For the first time, there's no money for clothes for the children, for toys,'' she said. The `` intefadeh,'' Arabic for uprising, was also brought home to the family 10 days ago when a 14-year-old cousin got caught up in a stoning incident and was arrested by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers. Mrs. <PERSON> Shatara </PERSON> said her nephew was held three days and complained he was beaten. She said the family would not go to midnight Mass both because of the general strike and a lack of spirit. `` There's no joy in our house,'' she said. Others disagree with plans to drop Christmas rituals. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Elian </PERSON>, another <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> resident, complained that Christians were becoming a beleaguered minority in the biblical city and should celebrate to assert their presence. `` All year, we've had days of sorrow. We need a day to smile,'' he said when <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> officials announced last month that a traditional Christmas parade would be canceled and the town Christmas tree would be without lights. Israeli authorities are going ahead with plans to hold the usual ceremony on Christmas Eve in which the military administrators of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> greet church leaders in <LOCATION> Manger </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, near the grotto where Christ is said to have been born. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rossing </PERSON>, an Israeli expert on Christianity, explained at a government briefing that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> felt it was important to maintain this arrangement that dates to when the Turkish and the British ruled this region. `` You'll never convince me that this is n't important to the churches,'' he said. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> also plans a Christmas Eve concert in <LOCATION> Manger </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, featuring choirs from <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Shiloh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> D.C </ORGANIZATION>. Asked her wish for Christmas, Mrs. <PERSON> Shatara </PERSON> replied, `` salaam'' _ peace in Arabic. `` I hope that on this birthday of the prince of peace there will be peace for all of us,'' she said.

A currency dealer described trading as light due to a dearth of news regarding exchange rates. `` The dollar may have moved up somewhat but it's nothing major because market participants are sticking to the sidelines ahead of the weekend,'' the dealer said, speaking anonymously. But on Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> Gov. <PERSON> Satoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sumita </PERSON> said the foreign exchange market was stabilizing in the wake of the dollar's recent sharp decline He also said the central bank would continue to monitor the market. Securities dealers attributed the bullish <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> stock market to stable currency exchange rates and a wait-and-see mood ahead of the New Year holiday period. `` Most foreign players seem to be out of town for the Christmas break and as a result, the whole market is slowing down,'' said a trader with a <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> securities company. Another dealer said investors were trading actively ahead of the expected demise of the 87-year-old Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>, who has been seriously ill for over three months. `` The market will very likely slow down when the emperor passes away,'' said the dealer at <ORGANIZATION> Sanyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` But on the other hand, there is apparently a huge amount of excess money in investors' hands, so many of them feel it is time to invest.'' <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> has been bedridden since Sept. 19 when he vomited blood due to internal hemorrhaging. Share prices have tended to dip in recent days in reaction to reports on his worsening health.

 <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> say they will continue supporting rebels fighting each other's governments, despite having signed a pact pledging not to interfere in each other's domestic affairs. Foreign ministers of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> signed the agreement Thursday granting independence to <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, which will become the new nation of <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> in 1991. It has been ruled by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> since World War I. The pact also stated that 50,000 Cuban troops in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> will withdraw, under <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> supervision. The signatories affirmed `` the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of states'' and promised not to allow their territory to be used `` in connection with any acts of war, aggression, or violence, against the territorial integrity, inviolability of borders or independence of any state of southwestern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> backs rebels fighting to overthrow <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s Marxist government, and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> harbors bases of the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, which is fighting <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s white-led government. <PERSON> Afonso </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunem </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s foreign minister, told reporters `` the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> is carrying out a just fight in the name of all humanity against apartheid, therefore the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> will continue to receive the solidarity and support from our government and our people.'' He denied <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> is part of `` southwestern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,'' saying that region encompasses only <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. But he refused to say whether the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> will be allowed to maintain several bases in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. At a separate news conference, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s foreign minister, R.F. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, was asked if his country would suspend assistance to Angolan rebels, known as <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION>. `` I would be telling you a lie if I say to you that we can suddenly end our friendship with <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION>,'' he replied. `` We will remain sympathetic to that organization. Friendship can not be terminated in this manner.'' He promised, however, that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> would not violate the accords, suggesting it will continue with political and diplomatic support of the rebels but will not send weapons. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said if the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> `` is allowed by <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> to continue to operate as they've done up to now from <LOCATION> Angolan </LOCATION> territory ... to kill members of the civilian population of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, that would be a clear-cut violation of the various agreements.'' <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assistant secretary of state who mediated talks leading to the accords, told reporters Wednesday the question of support for rebels was a matter between <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON>, Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> and other diplomats watched the signing of the accords Thursday. `` With the independence of <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s last colonial question will have been resolved,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. The agreement calls for a one-year transition to independence for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, beginning April 1. Under the pact, half the 50,000 Cuban soldiers are to pull out by Nov. 1, when <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> is to hold its first free elections for a national assembly. The rest must be gone by July 1, 1991. Foreign ministers <PERSON> Isidoro </PERSON> <PERSON> Malmierca </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunem </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> then signed an agreement under which 70 <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeepers will monitor the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> withdrawal. A <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> plan for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s independence calls for about 2,000 civilian administrators and military police to back about 7,500 <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeepers as South African troops withdraw and a civilian government is organized. The <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, which has fought South African forces in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> more than 20 years, was not part of the accords but said it will honor a cease-fire. Angolan guerrillas also were excluded. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has controlled <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, a mineral-rich territory of about 1.2 million people, since capturing it from <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in World War I. It refused to leave, despite <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> opposition to its presence there.

 Reflecting the climate of detente between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nation </ORGANIZATION>'s 43rd <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> concluded its most harmonious session. The buoyant, sometimes tumultuous session that ended Thursday was highlighted by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s farewell, <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s show-stopping debut and the assembly's decision for the first time to leave <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and travel to <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> to hear <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> The 12-week session adopted most resolutions by consensus including, for the first time, the <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> resolution recognizing the Soviet troop withdrawal. It adopted the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> budget without a divisive note Wednesday _ the first time the financial plan was adopted without a vote since the world body was founded 42 years ago. The 1990-91 budget of $ 1.76 billion was about $ 22 million less than the last. Its adoption by consensus and the lower expenditure were viewed as a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> victory. <PERSON> Dante </PERSON> <PERSON> Caputo </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> president and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s foreign minister, told the closing session the assembly had benefited from the new international climate of detente and cooperation between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and had contributed to it <PERSON> Caputo </PERSON> said the consensus within the 159-member assembly was `` unprecedented in the history of the organization.'' The world body even charmed its most strident critic, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which committed itself during the session to repay nearly $ 500 million owed to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> budget and peacekeeping forces. The money had been withheld for years for ideological, budgetary and other reasons. Relations strained during most of the eight-year <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration eased considerably and when <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> delivered his final speech in September, he praised the world body for its peacekeeping and peacemaking in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and elsewhere. Before the session ended, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> played host at the signing of an agreement granting independence to <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, better known as <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. It was signed Thursday by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, which agreed to withdraw its 50,000 troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. The assembly will reconvene in mid-January to discuss financial questions and funding of a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> monitoring force in <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, the Soviet president, delivered a tour de force of <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> diplomacy at the assembly this month, promising unilaterally to cut 500,000 Soviet troops and many jet fighters in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. In December, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> refused <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> a visa to address the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> is an honored <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> invitee and, in protest, the assembly voted overwhelmingly to move to <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> to hear <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. There, <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> explicitly recognized <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist, renounced terrorism, and called for direct talks with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> announced it would end a 13-year ban and open a dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, changing the entire <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> landscape and opening new possibilities for peace.

<HEAD>Judge: Cannot Deport Aliens For Espousing Anti-American Beliefs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA DEUTSCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Alien supporters of a Marxist Palestinian group may not be deported because even non-citizens have the First Amendment right to espouse anti-American beliefs, a judge ruled in gutting a McCarthy-era law. `` In this case, the government is trying to stifle certain ideas from entering our society from certain aliens,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. `` Our society, however, was built on the premise that only through the free flow of ideas can our nation grow and prosper.'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s ruling Thursday struck down four provisions of the 1952 McCarran-Walter Act that allowed the government to deport aliens who advocated or were associated with groups espousing anti-American ideologies including communism. He said the sections of the law passed during a time when Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, R-Wis., was whipping up Cold War fears against communism were `` overbroad'' and could cause deportation for something as simple as wearing a political button `` Now I feel I can speak freely. I did not an hour ago,'' said <PERSON> Khader </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamide </PERSON>, 34, one of the eight defendants the government had sought to deport for allegedly supporting the Popular Front for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION>, a Marxist member of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organziation </ORGANIZATION>. In his ruling, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> also threw out an exception to a 1987 law that recognized free speech rights in deportation proceedings for all immigrants except members of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> acknowledged world concern over terrorist threats but said his decision would not interfere with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' ability to enforce laws already in place to deal with terrorism. `` Our decision ... today will not significantly deplete the government's arsenal in combating terrorism,'' said <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, whose ruling applies only to central and southern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindemann </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s lead attorney in the case, said the ruling would be appealed. He declined further comment. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, which helped in the defense, said the long-term effects of <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s ruling would not be evident until all appeals are resolved. However, he predicted the case will be resolved by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> and could create a landmark precedent in First Amendment law. The case involved seven Jordanians of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> descent and a Kenyan who were arrested two years ago, held without bail and subjected to deportation proceedings under the 36-year-old law. An immigration judge released them after prosecutors refused to present their allegations in public, demanding a secret forum that was refused. The government eventually dropped McCarran-Walter proceedings against all but two, although it sought deportation of the others on technical grounds. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> cited the landmark 1969 decision in <LOCATION> Brandenburg </LOCATION> vs. <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, in which the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> held that the government can only prohibit speech directed toward inciting imminent lawless action. The judge also ruled that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> exception to the 1987 Foreign Relations Authorization Act violated guarantees of due process and equal protection under the law. The Arab-American Anti-Discrimination committee sued the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on behalf of the immigrants, joined by the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> and the New York-based <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constitutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>, `` We feel as a community now we can speak our minds on the Palestinian issue,'' said <PERSON> Hamide </PERSON>, 34. `` We can speak our minds on the uprising on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> and express our opinions freely without the fear of being put in jail.'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constitutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> said the ruling on the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> exception means that `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> can not make politically motivated distinctions in providing First Amendment rights to aliens.''

 A high-tech smuggling ring involving dozens of companies and 10 countries was left in disarray by the arrest of a man charged with trying to sneak a computer to the Soviet bloc, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Eddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorandus </PERSON> <PERSON> Haak </PERSON>'s arrest and the seizure of the $ 1.1 million VAX computer last week culminated an eight-month investigation, said <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>, special agent in charge of Customs in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. VAX 8800 mainframe computer seized at <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> is capable of upgrading and controlling systems that launch and guide ballistic missiles, operate radar or run a mass transit system It is on a federal list that regulates the exportation of technologically advanced products and likely would have been used by the Soviet defense system, <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> said. `` By getting one of these computers, they have saved themselves 10 years and hundreds of millions of dollars in research and development,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON>, another Customs spokesman. `` These countries are walking from the Stone Age into the 21st century in one step at the expense of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and they're using this technology for interests contrary to <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> interests. <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> said the Soviet defense system began converting to <ORGANIZATION> VAX </ORGANIZATION> computers earlier in the'80s. `` But they can not build their own. The only way they can get it is through the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> said. `` If we can deny them from taking ours, they have to build the factories. It comes out of their defense budget and really slows them down.'' Customs officials said the investigation includes companies, brokers and shippers in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, Grand Rapids, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>; and <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. At least one arrest was expected in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, and others were possible, <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON> said. `` We need to determine whether these companies that transported and modified the goods were involving knowingly,'' <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON> said. `` The brokers are the people that we're after,'' <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> added. `` They are the people who are going to take it from legitimate industry and give it to illegitimate industry.'' There are other smuggling networks of similar scope, <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Haak </PERSON>'s network this year has purchased and diverted numerous VAX computers, the system mostly highly sought by the Soviets, <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> said. Those computer systems and others smuggled to Soviet countries during the past few years are worth tens of millions of dollars, he said. Agents arrested <PERSON> Haak </PERSON> on Dec. 14 after he paid $ 50,000 in Swiss francs to undercover agents, <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> said. They had promised to help <PERSON> Haak </PERSON> smuggle the computer to <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>, the Soviet bloc's center for computer technology, <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Haak </PERSON>, 42, is a Dutch national who lives in <LOCATION> Belsele </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>. A grand jury returned a three-count indictment charging him with conspiring to illegally export computer equipment from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>. If convicted of all counts, <PERSON> Haak </PERSON> could receive a maximum sentence of 35 years in prison and a $ 5.75 million fine. A federal magistrate on Thursday denied bond for <PERSON> Haak </PERSON> after prosecutors said he would probably flee this country if allowed to post bail.

<HEAD>Dollar Up Again Against Yen, Shares Decline</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar rose against the Japanese yen for the second consecutive day in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> today, while share prices declined in slow trading ahead of the year-end holiday period, traders said. The dollar opened higher at 124.90 yen and edged up a bit more, finishing the week's trading at 124.95 yen, up 0.33 yen from its close on Thursday, when it gained 0.40 yen. `` The dollar's not really rising all that much because there's a lack of buy orders. The market is really weak at this time of year,'' said an exchange dealer with a major commercial bank, speaking on condition of anonymity. The 225-isssue Nikkei Stock Average, which gained 76.42 points the previous day, lost 88.35 points, or 0.30 percent, closing at 29,686.26. Volume in the first section was estimated at a light 600 million shares, down from almost 734 million shares traded Thursday. `` Most foreign players seem to be out of town ... and as a result, the whole market is slowing down,'' said a broker based with a <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> securities company. Shipping stocks declined sharply following an announcement this morning that <ORGANIZATION> Yamashita-Shinnihon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steamship </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> had agreed to merge next June to form one of the country's largest shippers. In a statement, the two companies said the merger was necessary to resolve an operational crisis caused by a slump in the shipping sector brought on by the strong yen and the oil crises of the 1970s. The decline in shipping stocks also led to sell orders for steel, non-ferrous metals, heavy electrials and auto shares, market reports said. There are no foreign exchange dealings on Saturday, but the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> will be open for a half-day session.

 The owner of a yacht that once belonged to <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> wants to torpedo the boat and turn it into a habitat for fish because he's fed up with the controversy surrounding it after seven years. `` It looks like we're finally reaching the end of this ... ` Hitler-boat business' once and for all,'' said <PERSON> J.J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, who also owns <ORGANIZATION> A-1 </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> and Commercial Wrecking in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> came into possession of the 89-foot Ostwind boat in 1981 after it was abandoned on his property. Vice Mayor <PERSON> Abe </PERSON> <PERSON> Resnick </PERSON>, a Holocaust survivor, wants to sink the 50-year-old dilapidated boat to benefit marine life off <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> and mark next year's 50th anniversary of the Voyage of the Damned. `` We're gon na do whatever <PERSON> Resnick </PERSON> wants to do with this thing,'' <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said Thursday. `` We want to barge it to off of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> and apparently the Jewish community will be happy to take it and watch it burn and sink.

But the city commission still must approve the money. `` We want to apply the same solution to the Ostwind that <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> was trying to apply to the Jews,'' said <PERSON> Resnick </PERSON>, a concentration camp survivor who escaped and joined the Resistance. The sinking of the vessel would coincide with the anniversary of the 1939 voyage in which the ship <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> left from <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, with 900 Jews aboard at the beginning of World War II.

 Artist <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Dali </PERSON> was in stable condition today after being rushed to a hospital suffering from complications from a small intestinal lesion, doctors said. In a morning statement, a five-doctor team said the 84-year-old artist was taken from his Galatea Tower mansion to <ORGANIZATION> Figueras </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> late Thursday after experiencing nausea and vomiting a small amount of blood. The statement said an inspection of <PERSON> Dali </PERSON>'s intestinal tract showed a `` slight superficial lesion'' in the stomach lining. `` <PERSON> Dali </PERSON>'s condition, despite this incident, is similar to that of previous days, and a decision has been taken to keep him under observation'' for 48 to 72 hours, the statement said.

 A year before <PERSON> Bess </PERSON> <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> went on trial for allegedly bribing a judge to fix her lover's divorce case, an old friend said the former <LOCATION> Miss </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> was `` thinking very positively what it means to her life.'' `` She is saying, ` I'm going to create a new <PERSON> Bess </PERSON> <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON>,''' <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Funt </PERSON> told a reporter. If a new <PERSON> Bess </PERSON> <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> exists, she was the smiling, composed, seemingly confident woman who strode up the steps of the federal courthouse each weekday for the past four months. But once she sat down inside she was forced to listen to tales of the old <PERSON> Bess </PERSON> <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON>, a woman who was at the least `` eccentric'' _ her lawyer's term _ and possibly dominated by what the prosecutor called `` greed and vengeance.'' The issue for jurors was whether Miss <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> tried to bribe Judge <PERSON> Hortense </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON>, who was handling the divorce of Miss <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON>'s lover, <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> `` Andy'' <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON> Miss <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON>, the former commissioner of the city <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>, allegedly hired Mrs. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON>'s daughter, <PERSON> Sukhreet </PERSON>; in return, it was charged, the judge reduced <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON>'s support payments. On Thursday evening, the federal jury acquitted <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON>. Despite the verdict, the image of <PERSON> Bess </PERSON> <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> _ the first Jewish <LOCATION> Miss </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, a key political ally of Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, a successful consumer advocate, a popular TV personality _ was tarnished by her trial. Miss <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> never took the stand to speak for herself. But according to the testimony of others, she was cheap, secretive and vindictive. She was described as a woman worth $ 7 million who kept her jewels in a toolbox and once recycled a bouquet of flowers she'd received by changing the card and having them delivered to Mrs. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON>. A witness said she made numerous telephone calls on a private line to the judge's chambers, often using aliases, including `` <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON>'' and `` Mrs. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>.'' She did n't want daytime visitors at <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON>'s beachfront estate to know she had stayed overnight, so `` she would walk out the kitchen door and come in the front door, as if she had just arrived,'' according to the housekeeper. She invited <PERSON> Sukhreet </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON> to accompany her to a party, but insisted she use her former husband's name _ Ms. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON> was divorced in 1980 _ instead of the maiden name she shares with her mother. One night in June 1986, Miss <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> went to Ms. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON>'s apartment house dressed in a gray sweatsuit, a headband and lavender-tinted sunglasses She refused to give her name to the doorman. On a walk around the block, Miss <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> allegedly told Ms. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON> `` You could be dangerous,'' and warned her to `` keep your mouth shut.'' Witnesses recalled how she pointed out <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON>'s estranged wife on the street one day as `` an evil woman'' and celebrated with <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON> after his payments were reduced. Moreover, expectations were low when the trial began, for Miss <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> had been arrested for shoplifting in <LOCATION> Williamsport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>. She looked old and disheveled in newspaper photographers, and was reported to have been arrested earlier in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> on a similar charge But in the end, Miss <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON>'s eccentricities paled to her accuser's. <PERSON> Sukhreet </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON>, a plump, chatty, often fatuous woman who enjoyed the attention as much as Miss <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> disdained it, said electroshock therapy for depression had left her memory `` like Swiss cheese,'' and parlayed her status as the prosecution's key witness into at least a fleeting celebrity.

 Cheers broke out and former Miss America <PERSON> Bess </PERSON> <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> sobbed and kissed her co-defendant lover after their soap-opera-like divorce-fixing trial ended in acquittals. `` It's over,'' Miss <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> said after her two-year ordeal ended with Thursday night's verdict. `` I'm grateful for the American judicial system and I thank the jury for exonerating me.'' The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury also cleared <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON>'s lover, <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> `` Andy'' <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON>, 43, and retired state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Hortense </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON>, 76, who handled <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON>'s divorce. Miss <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON>, seated beside <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON>, kissed and hugged him after jury forewoman <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Berardi </PERSON> announced `` not guilty'' for each charge in the six-count indictment. Several people cheered, while key government witness <PERSON> Sukhreet </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON> _ daughter of <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON>'s co-defendant _ sat dazed several rows behind her. After the jury's final announcement, Miss <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> wiped away tears and crossed the courtroom to hug Ms. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON>'s frail mother. She then broke down and cried into her hands as <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON> massaged her back and neck. Miss <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON>, 64, who was Miss <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in 1945, had stared intently at the jury as they entered the courtroom shortly after 8 p.m. and delivered their verdict, rejecting the prosecution's contention thatthe three were guilty of conspiracy, mail fraud and bribe-related charges The jury had been sequestered by Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON> since Monday, when they began weighing the evidence from the 12-week trial. `` I really feel that given the prosecution's case, I had no other choice but to say not guilty,'' said the forewoman. <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON>, <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON>'s lawyer, said, `` Had it not been <PERSON> Bess </PERSON> <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON>, -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> would have never brought this case.'' But <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>, whose office has rarely lost a major case, disagreed. `` I think we would try this case again, sure,'' said <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>. `` Obviously, we're disappointed with the result.'' Miss <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON>, the city's former cultural affairs commissioner, was accused of trying to bribe Mrs. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON> by giving a city job to <PERSON> Sukhreet </PERSON>, the judge's emotionally troubled daughter. In return, prosecutors said, the judge reduced <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON>'s alimony payments with his ex-wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>. <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON>, a millionaire contractor, is serving a three-year sentence in the <LOCATION> Lewisburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, prison for pleading guilty to federal tax evasion charges in January. Before he was taken back into custody by marshals, he offered a one-word opinion: `` Outstanding.'' Much of the trial's focus was on Ms. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON>, who spent nine days on the stand testifying against her mother and reveled in the subsequent attention and publicity. `` Everybody's a winner. The truth came out,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON> testified how Miss <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> began cultivating her friendship in the summer of 1983; how her mother looked `` very sad'' when she asked about her involvement in the <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON> divorce case; and how Miss <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> confronted her in June 1986 during the grand jury investigation, telling her `` you could be dangerous ... keep your mouth shut.'' Ms. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON> said she was `` happy for <PERSON> Bess </PERSON> and <PERSON> Andy </PERSON>,'' a sentiment shared by another prosecution witness _ Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>. The mayor, whose once close relationship with Miss <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> unraveled amid the corruption charges, said simply, `` I'm glad for her as a personal friend.'' <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, who benefited from Miss <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON>'s friendship and celebrity when he was an unknown congressman running for mayor in 1977, was uncharacteristically subdued and barely looked at Miss <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> as he testified. The trial, which began Oct. 4, captured the public's imagination with its tales of high jinks and low comedy among <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s movers and shakers. While prosecutors alleged Miss <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> tried to `` buy justice in the courts of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>,'' her lawyers ridiculed the case as `` a soap opera, not a criminal trial.''

 It began as the <PERSON> Bess </PERSON> <PERSON> Mess </PERSON>, but at times it seemed to have turned into the <PERSON> Sukhreet </PERSON> <PERSON> Circus </PERSON>. Even as the trial of <PERSON> Bess </PERSON> <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> was threatening to destroy the career of one celebrity, it was creating another. She was <PERSON> Sukhreet </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON>, daughter of the judge whom <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> allegedly tried to influence. Throughout the trial, her antics _ which included singing in a cabaret and having a facial makeover on television _ amused, enraged and generally fascinated New Yorkers. No one seemed quite certain what to make of this bubbly, rotund woman who spoke candidly of undergoing electroshock therapy for depression, who spoke of her love for her mother as she testified against her, and who giggled as she discussed obscene telephone calls to her home. `` I've been portrayed as mad by more people than I can count,'' Ms. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON> said. `` And I've gone public to say to people, ` Well, see how mad you think I am.''' Ms. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON>, 39, went public in a big way. She spent nine days on the witness stand testifying as the prosecution's star witness against her mother, former state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Hortense </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON>, the 1945 Miss <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and the city's former cultural affairs commissioner. Ms. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON> allegedly was hired by Ms. <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> for a $ 19,000-a-year city job in order to influence Mrs. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON>. The 75-year-old judge was handling the divorce case of Ms. <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON>'s lover, <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> `` Andy'' <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON>. A federal jury Thursday evening acquitted the three of all charges. Ms. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON> stood beside her mother after the verdict, gently rubbing the ex-judge's shoulder while congratulating her. While Mrs. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON> told reporters her daughter had simply told the truth and supported her, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> admitted the government might have been better off with a more stable witness than the flighty <PERSON> Sukhreet </PERSON>. `` In many, many cases we bring, there are witnesses with a whole history of problems,'' said <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>. `` You do n't have the chance to pick your witnesses.'' The scene between the Gabels after the verdict came as no surprise to those who watched Mrs. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON> warmly greeting her daughter each day as the younger woman arrived to testify against her. `` My mother and I have truly never gotten along better,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON>. She insisted her testimony contained `` no smoking gun'' that proved her mother's guilt, nor any clear evidence that would exonerate her. But, she added: `` Based on what I know of my mother ... corruption and the selling of office is about the farthest thing I can think of from her modus operandi.'' Ms. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON>'s own modus operandi has included a wide streak of zaniness, best exemplified by her cabaret performance at a recent birthday party for <ORGANIZATION> Village </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> columnist <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Musto </PERSON>. Among the songs she sang: `` Let the Punishment Fit the Crime.'' She also appeared on a television talk show, `` People are Talking,'' to receive new makeup, hairstyle and clothes selected by a fashion consultant. Ms. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON> _ who changed her name from <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bess </PERSON> to an Indian word for ` happiness'' _ clearly has enjoyed her celebrity. Her next step? `` I guess I'll breathe a sigh of relief and look for a job,'' she said after the verdict. She is thinking of writing a book, and has toyed with the idea of a career in `` news and entertainment'' _ two fields she knows intimately by now.

<TEXT>
 Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> ended a visit to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> today with the two nations expressing a common desire to improve ties after nearly three decades of strained relations. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, accompanied by his wife, <PERSON> Sonia </PERSON>, departed for home from <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> after his five-day visit, the first by an Indian head of government since his grandfather, <PERSON> Jawaharlal </PERSON> <PERSON> Nehru </PERSON>, visited in 1954. Both sides said the visit ushered in a new era of good will between the world's most populous nations. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> said his trip marked a `` new beginning'' for the two countries. During the visit, the countries agreed to set up a joint working group to take up their most divisive issue, a territorial dispute that broke out into a short border war in 1962. `` The leaders of the two countries held earnest, in-depth discussions on the India-China boundary question and agreed to settle this question through peaceful and friendly consultations,'' a joint communique said. It added, `` They also agreed to develop their relations actively in other fields and work hard to create a favorable climate and conditions for a fair and reasonable settlement of the boundary question.'' It said <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s talks with Chinese Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> were held `` in an atmosphere of friendship, candidness and mutual understanding.'' <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> also met with senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> head <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Shangkun </PERSON>. The border issue, <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> said, is `` very complicated'' and a quick solution is unlikely. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> claims 36,000 square miles of mountainous frontier in what <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> says is northeast <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Arunachal </PERSON> <PERSON> Pradesh </PERSON> province. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> says <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> illegally occupies 14,500 square miles on its western border. The communique said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> `` expressed concern over anti-China activities by some Tibetan elements in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>,'' and that the Indian side repeated its policy of recognizing <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> as a part of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and banning Tibetans from carrying out anti-Chinese political activities on Indian soil. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has been the home of <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>'s religious leader, the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>, and thousands of his followers who fled <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> after an abortive anti-Chinese uprising in 1959. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> blames supporters of the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> for pro-independence activities that have led to violent clashes with police the past 14 months. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> on Thursday presided over the signing of three bilateral agreements _ a civil aviation accord calling for direct flights between <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, a three-year cultural agreement and a science and technology agreement The communique said Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> accepted an invitation to visit <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, but no date was set. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, grappling with economic problems at home, has made a commitment to improving relations with its neighbors. Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is expected to visit <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> next year, becoming the first Soviet leader to do so in 30 years. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> will likely normalize relations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> during the visit.

Acquaintances</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Police said today their investigation into the brutal slaying of a 26-year-old American teacher is focusing on friends and students who knew her. Investigators said they have questioned more than 25 teachers and students who were acquaintances and friends of <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Abel </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, woman found stabbed to death Tuesday. The <ORGANIZATION> Korea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> today quoted an unidentified investigator at the <ORGANIZATION> Kangnam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION> as saying, `` We suspect the murder was a crime of passion or a personal grudge in view of its savagery.'' Violent crime is relatively uncommon in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and personal attacks on foreigners are unusual. Ms. <PERSON> Abel </PERSON> was found dead in her apartment of multiple stab wounds, including a slashed throat. The <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> quoted police as saying investigators believe the attacker cut her throat after inflicting the other wounds. `` It seems that the attacker cut her throat to make sure she was dead because he feared her possible survival,'' police were quoted as saying. `` It leads us to suppose the victim knew her attacker well.'' Police said they questioned several Korean students who had frequented Ms. <PERSON> Abel </PERSON>'s apartment, as well as two other teachers and three Korean male students who took a trip to a resort area with the victim last weekend. The autopsy showed the victim was not sexually abused and police said they found some valuables in the apartment, which led them to believe robbery was not a motive. Ms. <PERSON> Abel </PERSON> came to <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> in October and was one of about 25 English-language teachers at a private school, the English Language Services. The school said she had worked in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> before coming to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Majority Of Israelis Favor Negotiations With PLO</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Fifty-four percent of Israelis favor negotiations with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, while 44 percent oppose such talks under any circumstances, according to a poll published today. The findings contrast with the policy of the new coalition government, which flatly rules out talks with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> says the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> is a terrorist organization. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> of the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc said in presenting the government Thursday that he invited the left-leaning <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to share power because <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> needed to present a united front against the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. The poll was conducted Tuesday and Wednesday by the <ORGANIZATION> Dahaf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, which interviewed 653 Israeli Jews. The results were published in the <ORGANIZATION> Yediot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ahronot </ORGANIZATION> newspaper. People were asked: `` Based on -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief -RRB- <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s statement in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, and on condition that he renounces terror, are you for or against negotiations with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>? Twenty-one percent said they definitely backed talks, while 33 percent said they favored negotiations. But 24 percent said they were definitely against talks, while 20 percent simply said they opposed negotiations. Two percent were undecided. The margin of error was plus or minus 2.5 percent, the institute said. Dahaf pollster <PERSON> Mina </PERSON> <PERSON> Zemach </PERSON> said the 54 percent approval rate was the highest measured by her institute. Similar surveys in the last two years found a support rate ranging from 48 percent to 52 percent, while the number of those rejecting talks fluctuated between 44 percent and 47 percent, she said. In October, one month before the Israeli election, 50 percent approved talks, while 47 percent objected and 3 percent had no opinion, Ms. <PERSON> Zemach </PERSON> said.

 Lebanese newspapers today published a Christmas letter to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> journalist <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> and his captors from the hostage's sister, <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Say </PERSON>. `` Please give <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> our message of love and concern during this Christmas season.

He was kidnapped in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on March 16, 1985. `` Traditionally this is a season of hope, peace and forgiveness, but there is little hope in my heart that I will see <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> and other hostages released during these Christmas holidays,'' the letter said. `` It is difficult to sustain hope after almost four years of working and praying for freedom for <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> and the other hostages. Some days it seems we have made no progress and are farther from our goal as ever. `` We hear mixed messages from the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and we have no clear guidelines about what we should do or could do on behalf of these innocent men,'' Mrs Say wrote. Addressing the kidnappers, the letter said: `` Only you, their captors, can end this stalemate. I pray for you to have the courage to bring this to a peaceful conclusion for humanitarian reasons.'' Mrs. Say concluded her letter by saying: `` We have all suffered enough. Please. May God be with you and peace be yours.'' On Thursday, relatives and friends made radio appeals to kidnappers holding <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> and the eight other American hostages to release them in time for Christmas. The Christian-controlled Voice of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> radio broadcast the appeals, which included messages from former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hostages <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenco </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jenco </PERSON> were held by Islamic Jihad, the same fundamentalist <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> Moslem faction holding <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> educator <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON>, who was kidnapped June 9, 1985. In a message from <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON> addressed <PERSON> Haj </PERSON>, the name by which the former American hostages knew their jailer. <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON>, freed Nov. 2, 1986, after being held 1 -LCB- years, told Haj: `` You have it within your power to take the first step toward justice and a better world for the Shiite Moslems. You told me personally that you believe in peace and justice. `` Now you have a wonderful opportunity to demonstrate your words of understanding and compassion. Release the hostages unilaterally and without conditions. `` Haj, you must have trust in the goodness of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people, it is worth a try.'' <PERSON> Jenco </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> priest who was freed July 27, 1986, by Islamic Jihad after 18 months in captivity, told <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON>: `` In 1985 we sadly celebrated midnight Mass together. A young guard brought a beautiful cake with the words ` Happy Birthday <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>.' It seems like yesterday. `` This Christmas, I am free to celebrate a free Christmas with my loved ones and yet I'm not free for knowing that you both are in prison for your fourth Christmas. May this Christmas be the day of your freedom.''

 A former army captain accused in the 1980 slaying of a Roman Catholic archbishop and being held in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> on other charges will not face extradition to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled. The court Thursday struck down a request for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to extradite <PERSON> Alvaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Saravia </PERSON> because it said there was n't enough evidence linking him to the murder of Archbishop <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnulfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Romero </PERSON>. The court also said Attorney General <PERSON> Giron </PERSON> <PERSON> Flores </PERSON> did not have the constitutional power to ask the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to send <PERSON> Saravia </PERSON> back to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Flores </PERSON> had directly asked the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for <PERSON> Saravia </PERSON>'s extradition The case went to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> after <PERSON> Saravia </PERSON>'s attorney requested a hearing <PERSON> Saravia </PERSON> has been jailed in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> since November 1987, when he was arrested for a traffic violation and authorities found he had been in the country illegally since 1985. It was not clear if Thursday's ruling could result in <PERSON> Saravia </PERSON>'s release The Salvadoran court said <PERSON> Saravia </PERSON> would not be subject to arrest if he were sent home. President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s government accused <PERSON> Saravia </PERSON> of arranging <PERSON> Romero </PERSON>'s assassination on orders of right-wing legislator <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> d'Aubuisson </PERSON>, who denied the allegation. <PERSON> Romero </PERSON>, an outspoken critic of right-wing death squads, was shot by a sniper while saying Mass in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> on March 24, 1980. The government's accusations were based on the testimony of <PERSON> Amadeo </PERSON> <PERSON> Garay </PERSON> <PERSON> Reyes </PERSON>, who allegedly drove the sniper to the church. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Garay </PERSON>'s testimony was not credible, partly because he waited more than seven years to come forward with his story.

 <LOCATION> Syracuse </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, turned off Christmas lights in memory of 35 students as Americans nationwide grieved for the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> jet crash victims, including a cabin attendant who'd planned to retire after Flight 103 landed. The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 crashed into a Scottish hamlet Wednesday night, killing all 258 on board. The dead included a top <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government Nazi hunter, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investment bank director, and students, military personnel and others coming home for the Christmas holidays. Many expressed shock and anger at reports that terrorism may have been involved and that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials kept quiet about warnings it received two weeks ago that a terrorist attack on a Pan Am flight was planned. `` We had no knowledge of any terrorist threats and now we feel like this could have been prevented,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Brunner </PERSON>, whose 20-year-old sister, <PERSON> Colleen </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Oswego </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> -RRB- State College junior, was killed. `` The anger does n't surpass the feeling of <PERSON> Colleen </PERSON> being gone,'' <PERSON> Brunner </PERSON> added, `` but I'd certainly like to get a hold of the terrorists.'' `` It's unforgivable,'' <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowenstein </PERSON>, a 19-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Syracuse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> sophomore who lost his 21-year-old brother and classmate, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>, said from his parents' <LOCATION> Mendham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Township </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, home. `` Had any of that information gotten back to my father, my brother would never have taken a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> flight.'' Those who for one reason or another had not boarded Flight 103 from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> expressed relief. Among the lucky ones was The Four Tops singing group, which was delayed by a <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. TV taping Lead singer <PERSON> Levi </PERSON> <PERSON> Stubbs </PERSON>, who landed in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> on Thursday with his three colleagues, said the group had just finished the TV show and arrived at their hotel when he called his wife to tell her he'd missed Flight 103 `` And she was crying and carrying on, and I asked, ` What's the matter?' And she told me what happened.'' One of the places hardest hit by the tragedy was <ORGANIZATION> Syracuse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, where 35 of the dead were enrolled in an international studies program. Mayor <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> ordered the city's Christmas lights turned off Thursday night and asked residents to do likewise. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> ordered flags flown at half-staff through Saturday. Two memorial services were held Thursday at <ORGANIZATION> Hendricks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chapel </ORGANIZATION>. Many participants had red, puffy eyes, and nearly all hugged each other afterward. `` When one person dies we are all diminished. It is like when a finger is severed, the whole body hurts,'' the Rev. <PERSON> Pauli </PERSON> <PERSON> Kowalewski </PERSON>, the school's <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> chaplain, told about 400 people attending one service. `` You can be consoled because <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> is crying with us. Christ grieves, too.'' `` It's so sad. You ca n't help but get pulled in,'' said <PERSON> Noelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellert </PERSON>, a freshman from <LOCATION> Cedar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grove </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> `` I do n't know how Christmas is going to be normal this year.'' The university tried to take a business-as-usual approach and finish the final two days of examinations before recessing for a three-week holiday break. University Chancellor <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Eggers </PERSON> instructed faculty members to give final exams to distraught students only if they were prepared to take them. Study program victims included 19-year-old twins <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> and <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Coker </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Mendham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Township </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> was majoring in liberal arts and communications at <LOCATION> Syracuse </LOCATION>; his brother was studying economics the University of <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, officials said. Both played soccer and ran track. Another student victim was <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlageter </PERSON>, 20, of <LOCATION> Warwick </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>, whose postcard to his girlfriend arrived at her home the day he died. `` I have n't seen it yet,'' said <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Menzies </PERSON>, 20, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rhode </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> junior. She said her mother told her about the postcard while she mourned Thursday with the <PERSON> Robert </PERSON>'s parents. At the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, flags were ordered flown at half-staff in memory of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON>, an attorney with the agency's Office of Special Investigations. <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON>, a 36-year-old father of two, had been in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> negotiating a treaty to allow some former <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to be deported there. Also killed was Mark A. Rein, a 44-year-old treasurer and director of the <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION> investment bank and father of two. Today would have been his 15th wedding anniversary, his widow, <PERSON> Denice </PERSON>, said from their <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> home. `` Thank God I have my kids and family,'' she said. In <LOCATION> Millbrae </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, friends gathered at the home of the parents of flight attendant <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON>, 41, who had planned to open a boutique with his wife in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> after 15 years with the airline. `` The terrible tragedy is that this was going to be his last flight,'' said <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> MacMichael </PERSON>, a friend who acted as a spokeswoman for the mourners.

 The holiday spirit is n't lost on <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s filthy rich who've decked the Rolls with boughs of holly and set out on an annual quest for the perfect gift that is opulent, unusual and expensive. The posh shops on Rodeo Drive this season offer entertainment's aristocracy the usual collection of magnificent gems, crystal and oddball dust catchers, such as the $ 4,000 Scrabble word game at <ORGANIZATION> Carrol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. Alfalfa-sprouting Chia Pets and the as-seen-on-TV <PERSON> Clapper </PERSON> power switches _ hot items elsewhere in the country _ wo n't be under the Yule trees of the <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bel-Air </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Malibu </LOCATION> Living up to the region's car-crazy image, shoppers are buying up facsimile and answering machines to hook to cellular telephones. Also hot at <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> Motoring Accessories: see-through hood covers to prevent road nicks. The perfect gift for high rollers is the new two-door <ORGANIZATION> Rolls-Royce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Silver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Spirit </ORGANIZATION> for $ 254,500 featured at <ORGANIZATION> Gregg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>. For a brief moment in the fast lane, though, a <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rent-a-Car </ORGANIZATION>'s luxury outlet down the street will rent a Rolls, <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes-Benz </ORGANIZATION> or Ferrari for about $ 500 a day. Gearys in <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> sells the popular $ 16 Christmas wreath for <ORGANIZATION> Rolls-Royce </ORGANIZATION> grills and limousine-traveling shoppers have shown a fondness for $ 20 miniature poinsettias available locally to decorate the interior. <PERSON> Lila </PERSON> <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> of <PERSON> Renta </PERSON> <PERSON> Yenta </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fernando </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> specialty service, has fulfilled a variety of unusual gift wishes this year. The well-to-do parents of one youngster hired a trapeze act that, for $ 5,000, features a man walking a high wire while playing an oboe. Ms. <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> has created several winter wonderlands by dusting a back yard with snow for $ 1,200, provided <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> and Mrs. <PERSON> Claus </PERSON> for $ 325 an hour and decorated trees at $ 100 each for her bi-coastal clientele. But pricey real estate is the Christmas granddaddy gift for <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s affluent. A giant red bow wraps around <PERSON> Zsa </PERSON> <PERSON> Zsa </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON>'s estate in <LOCATION> Bel-Air </LOCATION>, just around the corner from President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s new digs. `` We are giving it away for $ 15 million,'' real estate broker <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Silverman </PERSON> said of the Gabor house. The president and Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will spend the Christmas holidays in the <LOCATION> Bel-Air </LOCATION> house, their first stay at the residence that will become their main post-White House homestead. For those who want to rub elbows with the likes of <PERSON> Sylvester </PERSON> <PERSON> Stallone </PERSON> and <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Malibu </LOCATION> broker <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Gresante </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Jon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Real </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estate </ORGANIZATION> has a $ 4.2 million ocean cottage on <LOCATION> Broad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION>. Another holiday special is the ocean bluff residence <ORGANIZATION> Sea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pavilions </ORGANIZATION>, an $ 11.5 million estate featuring `` a symphony of exotic woods and French limestone,'' boasts <PERSON> Gresante </PERSON>. It also has a spa that seats 25. But presents for many well-heeled recipients will be measured by horsepower rather than square footage. At least one widely known <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> personality will be getting a custom <ORGANIZATION> Harley-Davidson </ORGANIZATION> motorcycle. His name was n't divulged because the gift is a surprise. `` Every year I stick one or two in someone's home under the tree,'' said bike builder <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomson </PERSON> of <PERSON> Bartels </PERSON>' Harley-Davidson. Regular <PERSON> Bartels </PERSON> customers include <PERSON> Stallone </PERSON>, <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Idol </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Rourke </PERSON>. Another is actor <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Busey </PERSON>, who is recovering from serious head injuries suffered in a Dec. 4 motorcycle accident. The Christmas morning deliveries are memorable, he said. `` The houses are so big I could have driven through their living rooms at 50 mph. You should see the steps I have to go up. I almost hit a sofa last year,'' said <PERSON> Thomson </PERSON>, who has a $ 28,000 <PERSON> Harley </PERSON> in the Neiman-Marcus catalogue. Unwrapping gifts culminates a Hollywood holiday season ritual of lavish parties, many of them presided over by <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, the show business <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> to the Stars. `` <PERSON> Zsa </PERSON> <PERSON> Zsa </PERSON> asked for a happy marriage and I told her, ` I ca n't perform miracles,''' said White `` Then, <PERSON> Sylvester </PERSON> <PERSON> Stallone </PERSON> asked for the same thing and I told him, `` It will be a rocky road.'''

<TEXT>
 Hundreds of train cars are hauling relief supplies into <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> daily, but railway tieups are slowing urgently needed shipments from arriving in the earthquake-devastated region, news reports said. Children traumatized by the Dec. 7 quake need psychological counseling and thousands of victims who lost limbs need prosthetics, the reports continued. Officials meanwhile began planning the reconstruction of cities, even though one report said the leveled town of <LOCATION> Spitak </LOCATION> was going to be rebuilt only a half-mile from a fault line. A commission of the ruling Politburo ordered all possible transport mobilized to ship trailers to the disaster area for use as medical stations, the official Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday. The panel found rail services in particular are `` a bottleneck slowing measures to overcome the effects of the natural calamity,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. New reports said Soviet authorities had evacuated 92,000 people from northern <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, a mountainous republic bordered by <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. The temblor that registered 6.9 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale killed an estimated 55,000 people and left 500,000 homeless. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> increased the official count of `` ruined'' villages to 300, and said 58 of them were obliterated by the quake. It also said about 10 percent of the livestock in the rural areas died. Freight traffic to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> is increasing daily as building materials join the relief supplies pouring into the tiny republic. But hauling cargo from the Armenian capital <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> to the city of <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION> and other stricken areas is still a problem, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. Rail service near the disaster area is erratic; unloading of freight cars is quickening, but still is not fast enough, even at 1,633 cars a day, it said, estimating at least 2,000 cars must pass through daily to fill needs. Armenian children, meanwhile, took up their books again in 23 temporary schools in the <LOCATION> Crimea </LOCATION>, hundreds of miles from their ruined homes, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported. Psychologists are working with victims to ease the pain of their experience, and warned that children especially could suffer for years to come, according to the newspaper Trud. Experts suggested it will take 15 years to psychologically rehabilitate a generation of Armenian children, the paper said. Physical rehabilitation is also looming as a massive undertaking. Thousands of people need artificial limbs and many others were paralyzed when they were crushed under tons of concrete, according to <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Schubert </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, quoted by the Novosti news service. Meanwhile, an article in Trud on plans for reconstruction of the destroyed city of <LOCATION> Spitak </LOCATION> raised as many questions as it answered. `` As shown by recent events, it sits on the intersection of two breaks in the earth's crust. Therefore, the city practically must be built on a new square, 500 to 600 meters -LRB- yards -RRB- from the current one.'' Without explaining how a move of a half-mile could make much difference in an earthquake like that of Dec. 7, which destroyed virtually every building in the city of 25,000, the newspaper said <LOCATION> Spitak </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION> will be placed in fields less susceptible to earthquake, on hard rock foundations.

<TEXT>
 A decision by Gov. <PERSON> Ned </PERSON> <PERSON> McWherter </PERSON> that blocks early parole reviews for some criminals will prevent such a hearing for the Rev. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>'s assassin for 10 years. The governor drew praise from a black political group's leader by amending a 1985 gubernatorial directive that calls for reviews of inmates for possible early release to relieve prison overcrowding. `` It shows he has concern for all people regardless of race,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Tennessee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. `` It took guts to do it.'' The <PERSON> McWherter </PERSON> amendment, outlined in a letter Thursday to <ORGANIZATION> Parole </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Traughber </PERSON>, excludes inmates from such an early review if they have been convicted of escape, attempt to escape or assault or homicide of an inmate or prison official. <PERSON> McWherter </PERSON>'s decision would not affect assassin <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>'s original parole eligibility date in 1998 but removes him from consideration for an early release because of his escape record, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Welles </PERSON>, the governor's legal counsel <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> was a fugitive from a <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> prison when he killed the civil rights leader in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> on April 4, 1968. He is serving a 99-year term at <LOCATION> Brushy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prison </LOCATION>, from which he escaped in June 1977. `` It's not just directed at Mr. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>'s situation. This affects the certain inmates that may be up for early release because of overcrowding,'' <PERSON> Welles </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Welles </PERSON> said the decision would keep about 100 inmates in jail. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>, now 60, pleaded guilty to first-degree murder in the assassination on March 9, 1969, but retracted his story three days later and has continued to claim his innocence. A 1985 directive designed to reduce prison overcrowding made <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> eligible for a parole hearing in November but was criticized by black leaders, including <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> wrote <PERSON> McWherter </PERSON>, requesting that the hearing be prevented. `` I asked him to do it before Christmas and make it a present to all of us. We did n't want a hearing at all,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, <PERSON> McWherter </PERSON>'s chief of staff, said the order was effective immediately for <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>, who has been turned down for early parole at least twice.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION> is headed toward a final vote on the free trade agreement with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that is scheduled to take effect New Year's Day. `` The U.S.-Canada free trade agreement is going to be put before <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> for a final decision before Christmas and it is going to be put in place by Jan. 1,'' Trade Minister <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Crosbie </PERSON> said Thursday. <PERSON> Crosbie </PERSON> made the comment as he opened debate in <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION> on the third and final reading for the trade agreement's enabling legislation. Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> won a second consecutive majority government in Nov. 21 elections, clearing the way for the trade agreement he signed with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in January. The party has been using its majority in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION> to speed through the passage, but even the most drastic limits would require deputies to stay at work until about 1 a.m. Saturday, Christmas Day. Some evidently homesick members sang Christmas carols during debate that carried past midnight Wednesday. A delay of days, weeks or probably even several months would not hinder the agreement, which will phase out all remaining tariffs between the two countries over a 10-year period. But supporters of the agreement say it would be embarrassing for <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> to have to ask the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to postpone the start of such a major undertaking. The approval in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION> then would allow the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to complete its work next week. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, which is appointed, has promised not to oppose the trade legislation. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> completed all its legislation for the agreement in September, but it was delayed in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> by intense opposition that forced <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> to call the election last fall. The opposition still wants <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> to clarify such issues as how much government help will be available for workers who lose their jobs as a result of plant closings linked to the trade agreement. <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>'s party has 169 of the 295 seats in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION>. The opposition <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> holds 82 and the socialist <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> 43.

 Traffic accidents on the nation's highways during the Christmas weekend may kill between 350 and 450 people, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> says. Last year, 389 people were killed in auto accidents over the Christmas holiday, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Carraro </PERSON>, a council statistician, said Thursday. During a normal Friday night through Monday non-holiday period in December an estimated 380 people die in crashes, she said. The council, headquarted in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, said millions of Americans would drive an estimated 11.1 billion miles between 6 p.m. Friday and 11:59 p.m. Monday. The council said its projection for traffic deaths over New Year's weekend was also 350 to 450.

<HEAD>Study: Higher Drinking Age Reduces Fatal Traffic Accidents</HEAD>

 Tougher penalties for drunken driving have no effect on fatal auto accidents among 19 - and 20-year-olds, but raising the drinking age to 21 leads to a dramatic reduction in deaths, a study suggests The fatality rate in single-vehicle, nighttime crashes involving drivers 19 and 20 years old declined 38 percent in the 28 months after <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> raised its drinking age from 19 to 21, said Dr. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Decker </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Vanderbilt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>. Tougher penalties for drunken driving, imposed by <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> in 1982, did not change the nighttime fatality rate among 19 and 20 year olds, said <PERSON> Decker </PERSON>, whose study appears in today's Journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` The threat of penalty in and of itself is not enough to solve the problem -LRB- of drunken driving -RRB-,'' he said. `` The true risk of being apprehended is so small that however Draconian the penalties are, it's not worth worrying about getting caught.'' In another <ORGANIZATION> JAMA </ORGANIZATION> report today, two studies found that requiring the use of seat belts signficantly reduced injuries and deaths and that accident victims who do not wear the seat belts pay nearly triple the health care bills of those who do. Those studies examined accidents in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> from 1981 to 1983 and accident victims taken to the trauma units of four Chicago-area hospitals. The <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> study examined statistics on drivers ages 15 to 24 in 1980 through 1986, said <PERSON> Decker </PERSON>, an assistant professor of preventive medicine. `` There's absolutely no reason to think the results would be substantially different in other states _ particularly now that there's some uniformity in the state drinking age laws,'' he said Wednesday. Motor vehicle accidents cause almost 40 percent of deaths among youths 15 to 24, and drunken driving is involved about half the time, the study said. Drinking ages varied across the country until <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> passed a law in 1984 requiring states to raise the limit to 21 or lose highway funds. <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> was the last state to comply, raising its drinking age as of July 1. <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>'s drinking age was 21 until 1971, when it was reduced to 18. The limit was raised to 19 in 1979 and 21 on Aug. 1, 1984, although people who were 19 by that date retained the right to drink as the law was phased in over two years. In the 28 months after the drinking age was raised to 21, the single-vehicle nighttime fatality rate among 19 - and 20-year-old was 14.8 per 100 million miles driven _ a 38 percent decline from the rate of 23.7 per 100 million vehicle miles during the preceding 55 months, the study said It did not give exact numbers. The study showed little change in the fatality rate among people 21 to 24, whose right to drink was unaffected by the change in the drinking age, <PERSON> Decker </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Mail Keeps Coming And There's No Room to Fix Christmas Dinner</HEAD>

 Cards for an ill child are arriving by the tens of thousands at the home of a woman who has been so inundated by the mail that she says she no longer has room to prepare Christmas dinner. `` We all have to go to a restaurant for Christmas. I ca n't even have Christmas in my own home,'' says <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> <PERSON> Keefe </PERSON>, founder of Child's Wish Come True. `` This can not go on.'' Pleas to stop sending cards only brought more, says Mrs. <PERSON> Keefe </PERSON>. On Tuesday it was 110,000 cards, and 70,000 more on Wednesday. Nearly 1 million pieces of mail arrived over a 10-day period, prompting Mrs. <PERSON> Keefe </PERSON> to notify postal officials that she would no longer accept mail for `` <PERSON> David </PERSON>.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Keefe </PERSON>'s organization tries to grant the wishes of dying children, and she thought she was doing just that last year when she began a campaign to help a cancer victim she'd heard of in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. Actually, the boy's name is <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Morby </PERSON>. He lives in Steely, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. His cancer is in remission. And he wants no more cards. In September 1987, when 13-year-old <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> was critically ill, he decided he wanted his name to appear in the Guinness Book of World Records for receiving more postcards than anyone else. His family made a public plea, and soon more than enough cards were coming in. They've never stopped, even after <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> had more than enough to earn him a spot in the record book, which has dropped the category in the 1989 edition. Despite pleas from his family that the cards be stopped, an estimated 3 million have been mailed from around the world to Steely, near <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>. Most have been placed in a warehouse by local postal authorities. Earlier this month, Mrs. <PERSON> Keefe </PERSON> and an organization in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> that had pitched in to help her appealed to well-wishers to stop the card campaign. After it became apparent her efforts to end the flow of cards had failed, a three-member board of the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> Child's Wish Come True advised Mrs. <PERSON> Keefe </PERSON> to begin refusing the mail. She decided Wednesday to take that step. The decision was tough because so many people were touched, Mrs. <PERSON> Keefe </PERSON> said, but `` enough is enough.''

 A storm system unleashed tornadoes in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and left four dead on rain-pelted highways before it met with cold Canadian air in the <LOCATION> upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, coating roads with freezing rain. A second winter storm, blamed for two other deaths, covered much of the <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> with snow. forcing roads to close. Forecasters predicted more of the same for the holiday weekend. Two tornadoes touched down in west-central <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> Thursday night, and strong thunderstorm winds blew a house off its foundation and damaged two apartment complexes in <LOCATION> Natchitoches </LOCATION>. No injuries were reported. Less than 25 miles to the north, a 6-month-old infant was among four <LOCATION> Coushatta </LOCATION> area residents killed when four vehicles collided during heavy rain, <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> said. Three others were injured. The strong flow of moisture from the Gulf of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> encountered cold Canadian air in the <LOCATION> upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, resulting in freezing rain from northern lower <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> into central <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. Showers and thunderstorms also extended from southern <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and western <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and southeastern <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, the heavy rain set a record of 2.18 inches for the day. Freezing rain made roads in northern <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> treacherous. Reports of traffic accidents were numerous, and sand and salt trucks were unable to cope with the heavy ice. The wet weather was expected to spread across the northeastern <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> today. Snow, meanwhile, extended from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> through eastern <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and eastern <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> to northeast <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. Snowfall totals in eastern <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> ranged up to 7 inches around the <LOCATION> Huron </LOCATION> area by late Thursday. A cold front brought another round of snow to the mountains of the West. Up to a foot of snow covered higher elevations of western <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, and heavy snow continued today in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>'s mountains. A succession of snowstorms also hit southern <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, an area that could escape a third drought year next summer with an ample snowpack. A second storm over the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> was expected to bring more snow to start the Christmas weekend. On Thursday, a 59-year-old man was killed when his car went out of control on an icy road in <LOCATION> Mangna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, and rolled over, authorities said. The day before, an 80-year-old <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, died of a stroke he suffered while clearing snow with a snowblower, police said. The forecast for today called for rain in the eastern <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> through the Appalachians, eastern parts of the lower <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> valleys into the central Gulf region, and from the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> to the central <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> coast. Snow was expected for central and eastern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and in the West over much of eastern <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and western <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>; freezing rain or sleet turning into rain in central <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>; and snowshowers across northern parts of the upper <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> and upper Great Lakes. Highs were expected in the teens and 20s from western <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> into western <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, across the northern Plains and in northern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>; 50s and 60s from the central <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> coast region through the desert <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, lower <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> valleys to the <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> coast.

<HEAD>Vietnam Ends Critical Parliament Session</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> adjourned its winter session after demanding greater reform and strongly criticizing the Communist government for the country's economic problems, official reports seen today said. The government not only accepted the criticism but President <PERSON> Do </PERSON> <PERSON> Muoi </PERSON> admitted that `` sluggish, inconsistent, perfunctory'' management had worsened the crisis, official <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanoi </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Few countries in the world have followed in our country's footsteps by patterning their 1988 scientific-technical norms after those backward trends set some 15 to 20 years ago,'' he said The 10-day session adjourned Thursday after passing 10 resolutions, including resolutions on making changes and amendments to the constitution, <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanoi </ORGANIZATION> said. A text of the broadcast did not specify what changes and amendments were sought. In a closing speech, assembly chairman <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Quang </PERSON> <PERSON> Dao </PERSON> said 1989 was the `` pivotal year'' for implementing economic reforms endorsed by the 1986 <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> congress </ORGANIZATION>, which also ushered in more critical thinking and `` openness'' in most aspects of Vietnamese life. The Western-style reforms are aimed at boosting production through decentralization of management and other measures. `` However, our country is facing great ordeals which require the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministers </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- central government -RRB-, and all the people to renovate even more profoundly and vigorously,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Vietnam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> called the session `` the liveliest in the life of this country's legislative body.'' `` Many deputies were strongly critical of the Council of Minister's weaknesses and mistakes in handling the economy and managing society,'' it said in a report Monday. They demanded more economic autonomy for local areas and reductions of agricultural taxes they said were hindering production. Last week, Minister of Finance <PERSON> Hoang </PERSON> <PERSON> Qui </PERSON> admitted before the Parliament that the tax system has to be `` completely revamped.'' In Wednesday's session, <PERSON> Do </PERSON> <PERSON> Muoi </PERSON> conceded the government's mismanagement in a speech and said: `` I admit these shortcomings before the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> and promise to draw experience from them. He acknowledged that in per capita income terms, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> is ranked one of the poorest nations on earth. Do <PERSON> Muoi </PERSON> said government spending has far exceeded national income `` and has even consumed our national capital and loans from foreign countries and does not show any signs of improvement.''

<TEXT>
 Since philosopher <PERSON> Leszek </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolakowski </PERSON> broke his 20-year exile to visit his homeland, he has been toasted by the opposition and ignored by the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to which he once belonged. Hundreds of colleagues, friends and students too young to have heard the young <PERSON> Kolakowski </PERSON> openly criticize Polish authorities have been filling auditoriums for the so-called `` Kolakowski Festival'' that began Monday. The lectures are the first in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> by the 61-year-old <PERSON> Kolakowski </PERSON> since he was expelled from <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in 1968. <PERSON> Kolakowski </PERSON>'s works are published in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> only by the underground press. Based at <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kolakowski </PERSON> has become one of the world's leading philosophers, winning fame for his three-volume `` History of Marxist Thought,'' which focuses on what the author calls discrepancies between dogma and practice in communist countries. `` The lectures have become a ` Kolakowski Festival' and an important one for us,'' said <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Turowicz </PERSON>, editor of the influential <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> weekly <ORGANIZATION> Tygodnik </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Powszechny </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION>. About 500 students, academics and leading members of the Polish opposition squeezed together on the dark wooden benches of the main auditorium at <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> on Monday to hear <PERSON> Kolakowski </PERSON>'s first lecture. They gave <PERSON> Kolakowski </PERSON> a two-minute standing ovation when he stood up to speak. <PERSON> Kolakowski </PERSON> told the audience that when he left <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in 1968, three secret police cars accompanied him to the airport, while on this trip they have n't paid him any attention. On Wednesday, at an evening sponsored by the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> branch of the Club of the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligentsia </ORGANIZATION> in the basement of a <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> church, <PERSON> Kolakowski </PERSON> easily answered questions on the existence of devils and mystics and the link between philosophy and religion. But when a question about the future of the banned trade union movement Solidarity was raised, <PERSON> Kolakowski </PERSON> hesitated. `` I have no recipe. Nothing is guaranteed,'' he said. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> this year admitted wrongdoing in its purge of intellectuals and Jews in 1968 and made clear that the flood of scholars who left the country then were welcome to return. The granting of a visa to <PERSON> Kolakowski </PERSON>, visiting as a guest of the <ORGANIZATION> Polish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Philosophical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, is the most dramatic acceptance to date of that invitation. <PERSON> Kolakowski </PERSON> is expected to stay in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> about three weeks. <PERSON> Kolakowski </PERSON> began his academic career as a party member in the early 1950s but quickly clashed with orthodox communist ideologues. In 1956, during a political thaw after <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s death known as the Polish October, <PERSON> Kolakowski </PERSON> and a small group of communist intellectuals started Straight Talk, a lively journal of critical Marxist theory. The young philosopher urged the party to strive for `` integral democracy.'' For that view, the party leadership branded <PERSON> Kolakowski </PERSON> a `` revisionist'' and Straight Talk survived only a year before authorities banned it. A 1966 university lecture on the Polish October, in which <PERSON> Kolakowski </PERSON> accused authorities of breaking promises to the Polish people, cost the professor his party card. The final blow to <PERSON> Kolakowski </PERSON>'s academic career came when the Minister of Education revoked his chair after the philosopher defended students who had participated in March 1968 unrest. <PERSON> Kolakowski </PERSON> soon left <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and joined other Soviet bloc philosophers bloc forced into exile for their views, including <PERSON> Georg </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukacs </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, deported to <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> in 1956, and <PERSON> Ernst </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>, who lost his chair at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leipzig </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in 1957. He taught at universities in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and finally settled at <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Finnish Police Believe Bomb Warning Linked To Personal Dispute</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Crash, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HELSINKI, Finland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Finnish police said today they have questioned an Arab resident in connection with a telephoned bomb warning to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy against an American airliner. Though some details of the warning appeared to fit the crash Wednesday of a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> jumbo jet in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, police said they found no proof of a link between the warning and the tragedy that killed all 258 people on board and 22 people in <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Seppo </PERSON> <PERSON> Tiitinen </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION>, said the call was a message of warning, rather than a threat. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> was warned Dec. 5 that an Arab residing in <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> would plant a bomb aboard an American airliner originating from <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, `` within a couple of weeks,'' he said. Pan Am Flight 103 originated in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> as a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727, and continued from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> as a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747. The caller, who spoke English with an Arabic accent, said the bomb would be carried aboard the aircraft by a Finnish woman, but it was not clear if she would be a willing accomplice, <PERSON> Tiitinen </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. The same caller had issued bomb warnings to the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassies earlier this year, each time naming the would-be bomber, <PERSON> Tiitinen </PERSON> said. The caller said the <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> group, an extremist <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> organization, was behind the plan. <PERSON> Tiitinen </PERSON> said the identity of the caller was not certain, but officers had spoken to the man that the caller accused of preparing the bomb. `` It's a man who has been living in <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> for some time and is married to a Finnish woman,'' he said. He declined to identify him by name, but said he had no record of trouble with the police. `` We have questioned this man both in connection with earlier threats and now after the crash in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, but so far we have no reason to believe that he has anything to do with threats or the accident,'' <PERSON> Tiitinen </PERSON> said. He said police thought the calls were connected to a personal feud between the two men. `` We think it's more a case of personal relationships than anything else,'' <PERSON> Tiitinen </PERSON> said. But he denied the warnings were dismissed. `` All messages have been taken very seriously,'' he said. <PERSON> Tiitinen </PERSON> said the phone warnings began in the first half of this year to the Israeli embassy, and were similarly worded. He declined to say how many times the embassies were called.

<TEXT>
 A newspaper today quoted a security source as saying investigators were taking `` very seriously'' a pro-Iranian group's claim that it was responsible for the crash of a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> jetliner in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. The Independent quoted the senior <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> security source as saying the group is thought to have sought revenge for the July 3 downing of an Iranian jetliner by a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warship in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. An anonymous caller to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> claimed Thursday the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution were responsible for Wednesday's crash of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103, which killed all 258 on board and 22 people on the ground. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> today said the claim was a `` crude propaganda ploy'' designed to discredit <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, and it denied involvement in the crash. The official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, quoted an unidentified ministry spokesman as saying in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>: `` The scheme seems to be deliberately designed by foreign enemies of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> for specific purposes.'' The Independent quoted the unnamed source as identifying the group as `` a fundamentalist Moslem group of Lebanon-based Islamic Jihad fanatics.'' Investigators also focused on pre-crash threats of a terrorist strike. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said an anonymous caller to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, said Dec. 5 that a bomb would be planted aboard a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> flight from <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> within two weeks. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Churchill-Coleman </PERSON>, head of <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> Yard's anti-terrorist branch, opened an investigation Thursday of the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> stopover of Flight 103, which originated in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> and was bound for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The sabotage theory focused on transfer of luggage between the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 that flew the Frankfurt-London leg, and the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 that took off for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Government and industry officials said it seemed clear the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 broke apart in flight, strewing blazing wreckage over the Scottish village of <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION> and surrounding hills. Such a sudden catastrophe would be consistent with flight controller reports that the cockpit sent no distress call as the plane, having reached cruising altitude of 31,000 feet, disappeared from radar. The Times of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accident </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Branch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Britain </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> was examining wreckage under microscopes to measure the depth of indentations. It said years of research showed that if a bomb is detonated in an aircraft, fragments smash into their surroundings with 10 times more force than if the plane is downed for some other reason. It said investigators were also looking for minute traces of burns or of explosive itself on seats and victims. `` It is in many ways like a criminal investigation,'' <ORGANIZATION> Lockerbie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Superintendent <PERSON> Angus </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> told reporters. `` You have to preserve the scene. We have to photograph bodies, and bits and pieces. It is a very long and very painstaking task.'' Other news reports quoted investigators as saying that the fact a few pieces of wreckage were found up to 80 miles from <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION> suggested the plane had been blown apart by a powerful bomb.

<HEAD>Algerian President Re-elected To Third Term</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Algerians re-elected <PERSON> Chadli </PERSON> <PERSON> Bendjedid </PERSON> to his third presidential term by a smaller margin than ever before, but still gave him a mandate to continue reforms that began two months ago. Thg <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> announced early today that <PERSON> Bendjedid </PERSON>, the single candidate, had captured 81 percent of Thursday's vote. About 89 percent of the country's 12 million eligible voters cast ballots. Voter turnout in <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> traditionally runs at about 90 percent. As in most one-party states where a single candidate is on the ballot, voter abstention is seen as the only real form of dissent in elections. Although still winning a high percentage of votes, the win was 14 percent smaller than 1984 when <PERSON> Bendjedid </PERSON> garnered 95 percent of the vote with voter turnout at about 95 percent. In 1979, he took 94 percent. While reflecting a decline in popularity, the election still gives <ORGANIZATION> Bendjedid </ORGANIZATION> a clear mandate to continue with the economic reforms introduced after a week of rioting in early October that claimed 176 lives. Rioters filled the streets to protest high unemployment, inflation and a chronic housing shortage. In an effort to restore calm, <PERSON> Bendjedid </PERSON> promised a more liberal political system and less central control of both the economy and society. In his third term, <PERSON> Bendjedid </PERSON> faces the task of reducing the power of a military and civilian bureaucracy that has built a comfortable position in the 25 years since independence from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. He also has promised to loosen the grip of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, the only legal political party, on all aspects of Algerian life. One problem is how to permit more autonomy and democratic freedom without allowing opposition parties. The severe economic problems remain, many traceable to several years of low oil prices on world markets. Unemployment and annual inflation have surpassed 20 percent and the foreign debt is $ 23 billion.

<HEAD>SRP Manager Says Plant Could Be Started Immediately If Needed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plant </LOCATION>'s reactors, which have been shut down by safety concerns, could be restarted immediately if the nation's defense demanded more nuclear weapons material, the complex's manager said. But plant manager <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> declined to say when he thought the plant in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> nearly 20 miles southeast of here would be restarted. `` I think that remains to be defined,'' <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> said in interviews published today in The <ORGANIZATION> Augusta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chronicle </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Augusta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>. `` There has been speculation that it would be six months or 12 months. I really think until the ... criteria are well defined ... it's sheer speculation to pick a date. `` I certainly think they -LRB- the reactors -RRB- can be restarted safely. I think if the nation judged there was a need for the materials ... they could be restarted today.'' <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> was interviewed Thursday, on the same day <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> announced that ultrasonic testing would be used to check for possible cracks in reactor vessels. That could delay <ORGANIZATION> SRP </ORGANIZATION>'s restart until next summer. All three <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> reactors have been shut down since summer for safety upgrades and maintenance. The shutdown is one of a number of problems plaguing the nation's nuclear weapons production system, including plants in <LOCATION> Fernald </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, and Rocky Flats, <PERSON> Colo </PERSON>. Some have expressed concern the shutdown at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> could harm the nation's defense because the complex is <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s only producer of tritium, an isotope of hydrogen which is a critical element in hydrogen bombs and which deteriorates at the rate of 5.5 percent a year. <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> contended that the plant is safe to operate now, and said the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> wants to increase the complex's `` margin of safety. The reactors have `` run safely for 35 years meeting the nation's needs,'' said <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON>, whose employer, <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION>, runs the plant for DOE. `` They've run without a nuclear incident that was an injury to anybody either on or off the plant, and they've been continuously upgraded over that time.'' <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> said politics have played a role in the debate over the plant's safety. Plant officials were criticized in congressional hearings earlier this year for not adequately reporting past safety problems. `` Certainly, if you go back in time from 1950 to this year, we have not only provided DOE with notification of what we considered significant events ... but also a wrapup of what it meant,'' <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> countered. `` But with all the current attention, there is an increasing emphasis from the DOE to know things sooner and at a greater level of detail. And so we're working to develop a system and have that available to them. `` Some of it's clearly congressional pressure.'' <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> is wrapping up its involvement with the plant, which dates back to the plant's construction in the 1950s. <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> is scheduled to take over operations of the facility April 1.

 The pilot of a medical helicopter that crashed in heavy fog, killing a young patient and two medical workers, may have been trying to head for an airport southwest of town, officials said. The Bell Long Ranger Model 206L crashed in a muddy soybean field before dawn Thursday, killing <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON>, 7, who had suffered a broken neck in <LOCATION> Marion </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, hours earlier and was being airlifted to <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. Also killed were flight nurse <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Scherer </PERSON>, 26, and respiratory therapist <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Huttegger </PERSON>, 22. Pilot <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudzek </PERSON>, 39, was in stable condition today at <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francis </LOCATION>, hospital officials said. He underwent surgery for multiple fractures, including broken legs, and suffered second - and third-degree burns over 15 percent of his body <PERSON> Rudzek </PERSON> was in radio contact with <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> and reported no trouble during the 30-minute, 40-mile flight from <PERSON> Marion </PERSON>, where he picked <PERSON> James </PERSON> up, emergency room officials said. Contact was lost just before the aircraft went down about three miles from the hospital around 4:30 a.m.. A farmer found the craft's wreckage nearly three hours later Skies were clear when the helicopter, owned by <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Evac </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, left <PERSON> Marion </PERSON>, said hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Spell </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Girardeau </LOCATION>, a city of about 35,000 people about 110 miles south of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, `` just got socked in -LRB- by fog -RRB- real quick,'' said Spell. `` The last that was heard was when <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Evac </ORGANIZATION> 3 was circling the <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Girardeau </LOCATION> airport in really heavy fog.''

<TEXT>
 An apology from a judge who said he gave a killer a lenient sentence because the victims were `` queers'' did little to ease the demands of gay rights activists and others who want him removed from the bench. `` He has cast a reasonable doubt into the minds of people across this nation about <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> justice,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Waybourn </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>. `` He has raised the question of his judicial fitness and ability to be impartial. This question can not be answered with a simple apology.'' State District Judge <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON> apologized on Thursday for a `` poor choice of words.'' <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> last week that he sentenced <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Bednarski </PERSON>, 18, to 30 years in prison instead of life on Nov. 28, in part because the two victims were homosexuals who `` would n't have been killed if they had n't been cruising the streets picking up teen-age boys.'' `` I do n't much care for queers cruising the streets picking up teen-age boys. I've got a teen-age boy,'' the judge told the newspaper. <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON>'s statements outraged the gay community, which filed a complaint with the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judicial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conduct </ORGANIZATION> that could lead to his removal. Elected officials, including State Treasurer <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., also criticized <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON>, as did church leaders, some with large gay congregations, who asked him to repudiate the statements The judge's apology was addressed to the ministers. `` I did not mean to condemn the homosexual community generally and I used a poor choice of words and I'm sorry about that,'' <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON> said. He said he `` did not intend to state that any victim of crime was entitled to less fair treatment.'' The judge said Thursday he considered a variety of factors in sentencing <PERSON> Bednarski </PERSON>, including the defendant's age, his lack of a criminal record and `` what the victims were doing out there, but not their lifestyle.'' <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON> is up for re-election in 1990. `` His apology to eight citizens is not enough. His apology to every citizen is not enough,'' <PERSON> Waybourn </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Bednarski </PERSON>, the executor-murderer, can not get off by apologizing. Neither can Judge <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON>.'' About 50 sign-carrying demonstrators gathered in support of <LOCATION> Hampton </LOCATION> outside the courthouse. `` I think that is very generous of Judge <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON>. I think that merely shows how fair he is,'' attorney <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> McKnight </PERSON> said of the apology. `` I do not know who bestowed sacred cow status on the homosexuals of this community _ I do n't think they deserve it.''

<HEAD>Palestinian Leader Calls For Military Action Against Israel</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> leader said the yearlong uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> should be escalated with military action. <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaanoun </PERSON>, deputy speaker of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s parliament-in-exile, suggested Thursday night that the uprising take `` serious action to launch military operations here and there.'' He differentiated between military action and terrorism, saying military action `` is sanctioned by international law as long as our land is occupied.'' <PERSON> Zaanoun </PERSON> was addressing a rally at the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> to mark the 21st anniversary of the Popular Front for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION>, a leftist guerrilla group led by <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Habash </PERSON>. The Popular Front is united with <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s mainstream <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> and other groups under the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> umbrella. <PERSON> Zaanoun </PERSON> cautioned against expecting too much from the recently initiated PLO-U.S. dialogue. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has lost too much and wants to compensate for this loss by this theatrical piece,'' he said. `` We have to pursue an even-handed approach to avoid expecting too much from the diplomatic moves and devote part of our effort for struggle and perpetuation of the momentum of the uprising.'' He said the uprising should `` continue and become more vigorous.'' <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s Al-Qabas daily quoted <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chairman, as ruling out acceptance of anywhere but <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> as capital of the Palestinian state. `` A <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state with holy <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> as its capital is our demand, to which we will stick,'' he was quoted as saying in an interview. He also rejected the notion of demilitarizing the Palestinian state `` unless <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is disarmed,'' the newspaper said. `` We should be equal,'' he was quoted as saying. `` We want a completely sovereign state. Why should the Palestinians abandon part of their sovereignty and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> not be asked to do so?'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> initiated dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> after <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> explicitly recognized <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist and renounced terrorism. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said he had not `` succumbed'' to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> conditions so the talks could start. `` I did not change my policy. It was the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> which changed its policy,'' he said. Asked what prompted the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government to change its stand, <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said: `` Undoubtedly it was the attitude of 154 member states of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> who decided to shift the venue of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> debate on the Palestinian question to <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>.'' This move was taken after <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> denied <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> a visa, thus barring him from addressing the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.

 A fire that may have been caused by exploding fireworks swept through a ship carrying more than 120 people today, and the <ORGANIZATION> coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> guard </ORGANIZATION> said one person died and at least three people were injured. Passengers and crew abandoned the 1441-ton Dona Conchita five miles off <LOCATION> Panay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> island </LOCATION>, 250 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, said coast guard Lt. <PERSON> Enrico </PERSON> <PERSON> Coching </PERSON>. <PERSON> Coching </PERSON> said a 66-year-old woman was the only confirmed fatality. He said three people were injured, two with severe burns. There were widely varying reports on how many people were aboard the ship. <PERSON> Coching </PERSON> said 206 passengers and crew had been rescued. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Gothong </PERSON>, executive vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Carlos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> A. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gothong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION>, which owned the vessel, said company records indicated the ship was carrying 107 passengers and 48 crew members. In <LOCATION> Cebu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Gothong </PERSON>, a company director, said the ship was carrying 128 passengers and crew. <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Gothong </PERSON> said two people, including a pregnant woman, managed to reach shore and checked into a hospital with broken bones. The rest were rescued by the ship, <LOCATION> Our </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lady </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hope </LOCATION>, which rushed to the area to help, he said, and the company was `` 90 percent certain'' that all those aboard had been accounted for. The coast guard said the <PERSON> Dona </PERSON> <PERSON> Conchita </PERSON>, still afire hours after the blaze broke out, drifted into shallow water and ran aground on <LOCATION> Panay </LOCATION> island about five miles northeast of <LOCATION> Roxas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Survivors said they were roused from sleep by screams of fellow passengers and jumped into the <LOCATION> Sibuyan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. `` There was fire,'' said <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Adiola </PERSON>, 51. We jumped into the water and swam.'' He said it took nearly two hours for the first rescue vessels to reach the area. The <PERSON> Dona </PERSON> <PERSON> Conchita </PERSON> left <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Panay </LOCATION> island at 2 a.m. today bound for <LOCATION> Palompon </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Leyte </LOCATION> island and caught fire three hours later, company officials said. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Gothong </PERSON> said the crew radioed that firecracker explosions were heard and then a blaze started in the vessel's cargo hold. The fireworks cargo `` must have been loaded illegally, declared as something else,'' he said. He did not know how many fireworks had been aboard but said `` the crew reported a lot of explosions.'' The skipper radioed a distress signal and ordered passengers and crew to abandon ship at 5 a.m., he said.

 Actor <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> personally served venison from his recent Celebrity Hunt to the needy and made the point that the meat was being put to good use. `` To see the expression on the people's faces is pretty satisfying,'' said <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>, who held a hunt that drew 32 athletes, actors and popular musicians as well as the ire of animal rights activists. Wearing a flannel shirt and blue jeans, he dished out venison stew Thursday to hundreds of homeless and needy people at the <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Champa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> donated 500 pounds of the big game meat to the <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> and 500 pounds to the Rescue Mission in Grand Junction in western <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>. He planned to go to Grand Junction to participate in the meal for the homeless there today. <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>, who lives part of the year in the <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rockies </ORGANIZATION>, said he wanted the hunt to `` show the reason that you take game is for providing either for yourself or your family or, in this case, for other people, to get the message out to other hunters that we are able to maybe take some of our game and donate it to people who really need it.'' Nonetheless, his hunt troubled animal rights activists and triggered a dispute over hunting licenses with state agencies. Animal rights activists and some <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> celebrities took out a full page ad in the show-business publication Variety protesting the hunt.

 Three polygamist clan members wept and hugged their families after a jury convicted them on reduced homicide charges in the shooting death of a law officer killed during a 13-day siege. Clan patriarch <PERSON> Addam </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON>, 27, and his brother-in-law, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON>, 22, were convicted of manslaughter Thursday in the death of state Corrections Lt. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> House </PERSON>. <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON>, 21, was convicted of negligent homicide. House was killed during a Jan. 28 shootout that ended the clan's armed standoff with police at their Marion farm The impasse had begun 13 days earlier when <PERSON> Addam </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON>, who said he was guided by a divine revelation, bombed a nearby Mormon chapel. The three had been charged with second-degree murder in the death of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, who was struck by a rifle bullet as he directed police dogs to attack the Swapp brothers in an arrest attempt coordinated by an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> hostage rescue team. The maximum penalty for second-degree murder is five years to life in prison. For manslaughter, the maximum term is five years, and for negligent homicide one year in jail and a $ 2,500 fine. Third District Judge <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> scheduled sentencing for Jan. 20. The trio was somber and observers silent as the verdicts were read. But after court adjourned, <PERSON> Addam </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON> wept as he leaned over a rail to embrace his wives, sisters, sons and brother-in-law. <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON> also embraced his wife, whom he married in a jailhouse ceremony in November. `` I'm pleased and disappointed by the verdict, disappointed because we have an abiding conviction of the innocence of our clients,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bucher </PERSON>, <PERSON> Addam </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON>'s attorney. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Metos </PERSON>, Singer's attorney, said his client was relieved because he escaped a lengthy prison term. <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Spafford </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON>'s lawyer, said he `` could n't be happier'' with the jury's decision <PERSON> Addam </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON> was seriously wounded by an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> sharpshooter during the 20-second exchange in January. He said he never fired, and agents differed as to whether he was shouldering his rifle when he was shot. Singer acknowledged firing the shot that killed <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> but said he was shooting at the dogs. <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON> also admitted firing his rifle but said he was trying to keep officers from shooting his brother again. Prosecutor <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwendiman </PERSON> and fellow prosecutor <PERSON> Creighton </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> said they were neither surprised nor disappointed by the verdict. `` It was simply a tough case -LRB- for the jury -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> said. `` This should put to rest the incident at <LOCATION> Marion </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> House </PERSON>, widow of the slain officer, attended the nine-day trial. `` What was missing in this trial about the killing of Lt. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> House </PERSON> was <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> as a real person. He was and still is a model of character, of responsible behavior,'' she wrote in a statement following the verdict. Mrs. <PERSON> House </PERSON>, whose husband had four black belts in karate, said: `` His students and fellow workers respected this dedication, loyalty and team support. The Singer-Swapp affair is such a contrast in values.''

<TEXT>
 A police counterinsurgency unit active in the war against pro-independence guerrillas will be disbanded as a goodwill gesture following the agreement to end South African rule over <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, a police official said today. The unit, with a reputation for tough and sometimes controversial tactics, is known as <ORGANIZATION> Koevoet </ORGANIZATION> _ the <LOCATION> Afrikaans </LOCATION> word for `` crowbar.'' Chief Inspector Kierie du Rand said the unit would be phased out gradually starting April 1, the beginning of a seven-month transition process leading to elections for a Naimibian national assembly. <ORGANIZATION> Koevoet </ORGANIZATION> members have been involved in numerous court cases over the years related to allegations of brutality against black civilians in the northern war zone. Authorities have declined to disclose the number of men serving in the multiracial unit, but Foreign Minister <PERSON> Pik </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> said Thursday that overall police strength in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> would be reduced from 8,300 to 7,000. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> was speaking at a news conference after joining Angolan and Cuban officials in signing agreements at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to bring about independence in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> and remove <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> troops from neighboring <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Koevoet </ORGANIZATION> played a principal role in countering incursions by Angola-based insurgents of the <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, which began a bush war against <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> African rule in 1966 <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> is favored to win the Nov. 1 elections, but it is likely to be opposed by a multiracial coalition of parties participating in the current, South African-installed transitional government. <PERSON> Dirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Mudge </PERSON>, a white moderate who serves on the transitional <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION>, today urged an active campaign to `` ensure that political power remains in responsible hands.'' He said there should be no turning back from the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>' independence plan, known as Resolution 435. `` In spite of all the risks that may be involved in the implementation of Resolution 435, the failure of the peace effort will have serious, even disastrous, consequences that may include military confrontation,'' he said. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s defense minister, Gen. <PERSON> Magnus </PERSON> <PERSON> Malan </PERSON>, told reporters in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, under the agreement signed Thursday, would halt military assistance to <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> _ the pro-Western rebel movement fighting <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s Marxist government. However, <PERSON> Malan </PERSON> said <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> would maintain a friendly relationship with <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> and also expected <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> to close <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla bases on its territory. The <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> wages a bombing and sabotage campaign in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> aimed at undermining the white-controlled government. `` Should the Cubans launch a new offensive against <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> would not sit back with folded arms,'' <PERSON> Malan </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION>, in a statement issued in <LOCATION> Luanda </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, and reported by the Mozambican news agency AIM, hailed Thursday's agreement as a milestone but criticized proposals by Western countries to reduce by more than half the planned 7,500-member <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> monitoring force for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> said the smaller force would be unable to monitor the movements of South African military and police units, including <ORGANIZATION> Koevoet </ORGANIZATION>, which is described as `` internationally famed for its atrocities.'' <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> would try to use these security forces `` to create a climate of intimidation and insecurity and thereby to influence the outcome of the Namibian independence elections in favor of its surrogates.''

 A consumer boycott launched by blacks to protest the revival of municipal segregation laws caused huge Christmas-season losses for merchants in <LOCATION> Boksburg </LOCATION>, a local business leader said today. <PERSON> Johan </PERSON> <PERSON> Viljoen </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Boksburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, estimated that shopowners lost more than $ 420,000 during a four-week boycott protesting the reinstatement of `` whites only'' status at parks and other public facilities. Many businesses in the industrial town east of <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> would be unable to recover their losses and some were likely to close soon, <PERSON> Viljoen </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. Sales at some clothing and furniture stores were down by as much as 80 percent, he said. The resegregation campaign was undertaken by town council members of the far-right <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, who gained power in <LOCATION> Boksburg </LOCATION> and dozens of other municipalities in Oct. 26 election. Residents of black and mixed-race communities neighboring <LOCATION> Boksburg </LOCATION> _ who outnumber the 85,000 white residents by more than 3-to-1 _ said they would grant the town council its wish for a `` White Christmas'' by staying out of the central business district. On Thursday, developers of a $ 11 million shopping mall planned for <LOCATION> Boksburg </LOCATION> announced the project was shelved because of the city's bad business climate The major tenant would have been the OK Bazaar retail company. Its chief executive, <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Hood </PERSON>, said business at his company's existing store in <LOCATION> Boksburg </LOCATION> had declined by 49 percent in the past month A week ago, developers of another proposed shopping mall for <LOCATION> Boksburg </LOCATION> announced that their plans were being shelved until conditions in the town `` return to normal.'' The <LOCATION> Boksburg </LOCATION> council thus far has refused to back down, despite intense criticism from the government and local business groups. The Conservatives have accused the government of hypocrisy and challenged President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to repeal the Separate Amenities Act, which allows local officials to segregate public amenities. The government thus far has made no move to repeal the law and has not pushed for integration of whites-only facilities in towns controlled by <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> councils. `` The whole thing has been ripped out of proportion by the misinformation campaign of the media,'' said a <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader, <PERSON> Koos </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> der </PERSON> <PERSON> Merwe </PERSON>. `` Our promises were made within the Separate Amenities Act and the voters knew what they were voting for.''

<HEAD>Police Units Attacked Near Basque Region</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALSASUA, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Assailants believed to be Basque separatists fired grenades at a Civil Guard barracks in northern <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> today and bombed a convoy near another northern town. At least three men were wounded, police said. A police spokesman said at least two officers were hurt when a four-vehicle Civil Guard convoy was bombed on a highway near the northern Basque town of <LOCATION> Areta </LOCATION>, six miles south of the port of <LOCATION> Bilbao </LOCATION>. The spokesman said a passerby also was believed hurt. The blast came about eight hours after assailants launched a rocket-propelled grenade attack on a Civil Guard barracks outside <LOCATION> Alsasua </LOCATION> after apparently planting booby traps in the area, a Civil Guard spokesman said. Asusua is in the <LOCATION> Navarre </LOCATION> region that borders the northern Basque country. One Civil Guard officer was seriously injured when he tripped a booby-trap bomb, said the spokesman, who was not identified in keeping with custom. At least two other hidden bombs failed to detonate and two were defused, he said. No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attacks, but police said both bore the earmarks of <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION>, the Basque separatist organization. The group has carried out a 20-year violent campaign in an effort to secure independence from <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> for the three-province northern Basque region and to seek annexation of the bordering autonomous region of <LOCATION> Navarre </LOCATION>. Alsasua lies on the border with the Basque region, 30 miles east of <LOCATION> Pamplona </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Navarre </LOCATION> region's capital. A spokesman at <LOCATION> Pamplona </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION> hospital said the booby-trap blast blew away parts of both legs of guard <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Aguilar </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, 26. In another development, a gunman believed to be an <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> member killed Thursday the owner of a bar in <LOCATION> Zarauz </LOCATION>, a town in the Basque province of <LOCATION> Guizpuzcoa </LOCATION>. Authorities called the shooting of <PERSON> Engraciano </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> <PERSON> Macho </PERSON>, 42, `` a clear <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> attack,'' adding that the gunman was believed to be the same man who triggered a car bomb Sunday that killed a policeman and injured 12 people in <LOCATION> Eibar </LOCATION>, 25 miles east of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sebastian </LOCATION>. Since 1968, <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> has claimed responsibility for killing more than 600 people, mainly <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, police and military officers. So far this year ETA-claimed attacks have killed 17 people. ETA is an acronym in the Basque language for Homeland and <ORGANIZATION> Liberty </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Studies: Seat Belt Laws Reduce Accident Injuries, Deaths, Hospital
Costs</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Seat belt laws dramatically reduce serious injuries and deaths, and accident victims who did n't buckle up had medical bills three times higher than those who did, researchers reported today. The two studies, which examined traffic accidents in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, were published in the Journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. In the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> study of nearly 100,000 people involved in accidents from 1983 to 1987, researchers found that after seat belt legislation was enacted _ and especially after fines were imposed _ the number of deaths or serious injuries dropped dramatically. The second study examined 1,364 accident victims taken to trauma units of four Chicago-area hospitals. When the victims wore safety belts, hospital admissions decreased nearly 65 percent and related costs dropped 66 percent. `` Safety belts turn out to be an economical way of trying to reduce that health care dollar,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Orsay </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois-Chicago </ORGANIZATION>. She was primary author of the cost study. Thirty-one states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> have seat belt laws. The <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> study estimated that the state may have 1,100 fewer severe and fatal highway injuries each year as a result of mandatory seat belt use. `` What the study suggests is that each and every state could benefit from seat belt laws with primary enforcement,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reinfurt </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Chapel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, a co-author of the study. Primary enforcement, part of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>'s law, means police may stop a vehicle if the occupants are n't wearing seat belts. Other states with primary enforcement laws include <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> passed a law requiring seat belt use by front-seat occupants in 1985 and began imposing a $ 25 fine in 1987, the year a second study by the university found the state had the highest rate of seat belt use in the country. While the number of front-seat passengers in traffic accidents rose from 1983 through 1987, the percentage of serious or fatal injuries dropped significantly after the law was passed and again when the fines were imposed. In 1985, 4.7 percent of 19,385 front-seat passengers involved in accidents died or suffered severe injuries. In 1986, the figure was 4.4 percent of 20,603. In 1987, it was 3.8 percent of 21,752 victims. The <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> study showed that the average cost of treating accident victims who were wearing seat belts was $ 534 against $ 1,583 for those who did n't buckle up. Mandatory seat belt use would significantly decrease the financial burden on the public, Ms. <PERSON> Orsay </PERSON> said. `` We looked at who was paying for these costs, and a majority of people not wearing safety belts either had no insurance or were on public assistance of some sort,'' she said.

 A mysterious self-styled <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> in a Cadillac made an appearance at a soup kitchen for the seventh year in a row, lavishing Christmas cheer on the down and out in the form of crisp $ 10 bills. The middle-aged, gray-haired man arrived unannounced Thursday at the Midnight Mission. `` It's really very touching. He gives everyone a $ 10 bill and a warm smile, and 35 minutes later he's through _ with $ 6,000 left behind,'' said <PERSON> Clancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Imislund </PERSON>, spokesman for the mission. Imislund figured the well-dressed <ORGANIZATION> Cadillac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> has given away more than $ 30,000 over the years. The man clears the gift-giving with the mission's directors, but nobody knows exactly when he's coming. His name and occupation are not known, but his new <ORGANIZATION> Cadillac </ORGANIZATION> always has dealer plates. `` I figure he owns a dealership. So I say to him, ` Why do n't you go public with this?''' <PERSON> Imislund </PERSON> said. `` He just says, ` I'll tell you what. If I publicized this it would help my company, but it would keep me from having the pleasure of doing something I want to do.''' More than 500 people were in the mission when the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> and his two helpers arrived to a burst of applause. He worked the room, stuffing bills in everyone's pocket and shaking hands with grateful beneficiaries. Many of the homeless went straight to a liquor store. The <ORGANIZATION> Cadillac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> `` just says this is a Christmas present and he does n't want to tell anybody what to do with it,'' <PERSON> Imislund </PERSON> said. `` One old guy said, ` I should buy a drink,''' Imislund said. `` But instead he asks me for an envelope and stamp so he can send the money to his kid in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>.''

 When <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> was an assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney, says Illinois Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, he did n't quite fit into the `` velvet hammer'' school of prosecutors.

From the other side of the political aisle, Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Ill., said: `` He's an absolutely honorable man of the deepest personal integrity ... a very responsive person He's an easy man to deal with.'' But <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>, who is also a senior partner in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> law office of <ORGANIZATION> Sidley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, has drawn fire from Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> said Wednesday the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> should not vote to confirm <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> without investigating `` why -LRB- he -RRB- failed to pursue allegations of fraudulent testing of <ORGANIZATION> NutraSweet </ORGANIZATION>,'' the artificial sweetener, against the <ORGANIZATION> G.D. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Searle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> _ and later joined the firm that defended <PERSON> Searle </PERSON> in the case. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>'s office issued a statement saying he `` conducted himself in accordance with <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> guidelines in the matter mentioned by Sen. <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> served as first assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> from 1968 to 1975, and became <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>'s trusted friend. They hatched the idea for the office's Special Investigations Division, and <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> made <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> the division's first chief. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> built a reputation for toughness during one of <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION>' biggest federal corruption trials: the bribery case of former Gov <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerner </PERSON>, who was convicted in 1973. He is a two-time recipient of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> Outstanding Service Award. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>'s current agency funnels federal and state money to local transit agencies and oversees the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>, which operates city buses and suways; suburban bus systems; and commuter trains that run between <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and the suburbs. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> `` really runs, with the help of his board, a first class transit system,'' <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said. In 1975, when <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> left the office for the governor's chair, <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> was appointed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney by President Ford.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>'s death penalty law is unconstitutional, a federal appeals court ruled, giving new hope to about 85 condemned prisoners. The 7-4 ruling Thursday by the 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> reversed a death sentence in the 1976 car-bombing murder of a <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> newspaper reporter. The ruling found that the death penalty law violated the right to a jury trial by letting the trial judge decide whether a murder was a capital crime. The court also said the law improperly required the defendant to justify leniency and did not allow consideration of all pertinent evidence favoring leniency. If it stands, the ruling would overturn all death sentences issued in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> since the law was passed in 1973. In a separate 6-5 vote, the court ruled that even if the law had been valid, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamson </PERSON>'s death sentence was improper because the sentencing judge had previously ruled that a prison sentence was appropriate for the murder, and imposed a death sentence only after <PERSON> Adamson </PERSON> violated a plea agreement requiring him to testify against two other men. It was the second time the court overturned the death sentence of <PERSON> Adamson </PERSON>, who admitted planting the bomb in June 1976 that killed <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolles </PERSON>, an investigative reporter for The <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> reversed the first ruling and reinstated <PERSON> Adamson </PERSON>'s death sentence last year <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> said he would appeal <PERSON> Adamson </PERSON>'s case to the high court, and denounced the appeals court. `` You can not get a death penalty case through the <ORGANIZATION> 9th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ... because the majority of the judges are anti-death penalty,'' <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, one of <PERSON> Adamson </PERSON>'s lawyers, said the ruling affirms the right to have a jury decide a defendant's fate, `` rather than a judge who's subject to retention elections and political pressure.''

 A crack cocaine addict was so desperate to be treated for his drug dependency that he smashed the windows at two police stations to draw attention to himself, officials say. `` This case smacks you in the face because here is a guy who obviously wanted to be helped,'' said Criminal Court Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, who helped the addict, <PERSON> Alexis </PERSON> <PERSON> Vega </PERSON>, 34, to get treatment. `` This case dramatizes the critical need for treatment upon demand for all individuals addicted to drugs,'' said <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Gentile </PERSON>. <PERSON> Vega </PERSON>'s efforts to find treatment began after his wife and 8-month-old son left him last summer, according to accounts today in the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. First, he visited hospitals and treatment centers, but was told there was no room. <PERSON> Gentile </PERSON> and police confirmed that on one occasion the man spoke to the desk sergeant at a station house in the <LOCATION> Williamsbridge </LOCATION> section of the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>. `` I told him I had a problem and was seeking some help,'' <PERSON> Vega </PERSON> said. `` I could see they were n't going to arrest me or help. So I reached into my pockets and pulled out some stuff and put it on the desk, right in front of them.'' A hypodermic needle and two empty crack vials was enough to shock the officers, he said. `` They grabbed me, roughed me up a little, put the handcuffs on a little too tight, the usual stuff,'' <PERSON> Vega </PERSON> said. But when he was brought before a judge on misdemeanor charges, he was freed and his pleas to be enrolled in a treatment program were ignored, he said. Finally, breaking the windows at two police stations got him thrown into jail, into <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>'s courtroom and finally into a treatment program after the judge made a call on his behalf. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sierra </PERSON>, a staff member for the center's operator, the <ORGANIZATION> Way </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Out </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Vega </PERSON> had `` lucked out.'' `` We have a capacity of 58 men and a waiting list of 600 and there was one vacancy left when the judge called me,'' he said.

 <PERSON> Nikolaas </PERSON> <PERSON> Tinbergen </PERSON>, a Dutch-born British zoologist who won the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 1973, has died of an apparent stroke, his widow said today. He was 81. <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rutten </PERSON> said in a telephone interview that her husband of 56 years had `` quite reasonably recovered'' from a first stroke in 1983. He died Wednesday shortly after apparently suffering another stroke at his <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION> home. Born in The Hague in 1907, <PERSON> Tinbergen </PERSON> studied at universities in <LOCATION> Leiden </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, and at <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. He gained prominence in the late 1930s as one of the founders of ethology, the branch of biology that studies animal behavior. During World War II, he was detained by the occupying German forces at a detention camp in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>. After a pre-war spell with <PERSON> Konrad </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenz </PERSON>, the noted German zoologist, he was appointed professor of experimental zoology at <ORGANIZATION> Leiden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in 1947. Two years later, he became an ethology lecturer at <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, where he wrote `` The Study of Instinct,'' considered the first handbook on ethology ever published. He was a professor in animal behavior at <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION> from 1966 to 1974, and a professor emeritus there until his death. <PERSON> Tinbergen </PERSON>, who became a British citizen in 1955, was a prolific writer and an accomplished maker of nature films. He shared the 1973 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine with <PERSON> Lorenz </PERSON> and Austrian zoologist <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Frisch </PERSON> for their `` discoveries in the field of the organization and occurrence of individual and social behavioral patterns'' in the animal world. The 1973 prize was a new departure for the Nobel committee, acknowledging for the first time major advances in man's understanding of sociobiology, especially in the behavioral science known as ethology `` At one stroke, they -LRB- the three laureates -RRB- explained some of the most remarkable examples of the fine control of elaborate patterns of behavior by external stimuli known to science, sometimes learned, sometimes not, while leaving in no doubt the crucial importance of genetic differences in understanding the development of behavior,'' the British magazine Science said of their award. <PERSON> Tinbergen </PERSON>'s elder brother, <PERSON> Jan </PERSON>, won the first-ever Nobel Prize for Economics in 1969. <PERSON> Tinbergen </PERSON> is survived by his widow, two sons and three daughters.

They were accused of breaking into crack houses without a warrant in order to terrorize occupants. `` I certainly have no sympathy for dope dealers,'' District Judge <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Donahue </PERSON> said Thursday after a preliminary hearing. But he said the officers tried to do `` something legal in an illegal way.'' <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, 26, testified that officers with guns drawn broke into his house, where he had 20 bags of crack on a living room table, and forced him to eat cocaine. He testified one officer said, `` I'm going to make you addicted to crack.'' A witness in an apartment across the hall testified to overhearing someone say, `` Eat this. ... If you do n't I'll take you to jail,'' followed by laughter. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> was treated at a hospital for an overdose. Prosecutors said he may have saved his life after the police left by drinking vinegar to induce vomiting. The alleged unreported raids on crack houses were made just before dawn on Feb. 21. Defense attorneys said the action resulted from frustation in the battle against the city's drug trade. `` When police officers start playing it very, very, very safe, the city becomes very unsafe,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>'s attorney.

 Soldiers, police and prison guards today surrounded a penitentiary in northwestern <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> where inmates killed two people, wounded four and were holding 15 people hostage, officials said. The inmates may have rioted because they were denied Christmas pardons. About 10 inmates got hold of firearms and attacked the prison director's office Thursday, killing the director and an unidentified person and wounding four people during a shootout with guards, said <PERSON> Dante </PERSON> <PERSON> Salazar </PERSON>. <PERSON> Salazar </PERSON>, a spokesman for the Nayagit state attorney's office, said the inmates were holding 15 people hostages. The inmates allowed <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> personnel in part of the prison to remove the victims, said police spokesman <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Villasenor </PERSON> by telephone. `` The situation in there is very tense,'' <PERSON> Villasenor </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Salazar </PERSON> said he heard the rioting inmates were protesting because the Gov. <PERSON> Celso </PERSON> <PERSON> Delgado </PERSON> had not included them in a list of prisoners who received Christmas pardons for good conduct. <PERSON> Delgado </PERSON> today negotiated with the inmates by telephone from outside the <PERSON> Venustiano </PERSON> <PERSON> Carranza </PERSON> penitentiary in the city of <LOCATION> Tepic </LOCATION>, 500 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Soldiers, police and guards encircled the the prison. <PERSON> Salazar </PERSON> said others in the 1,200-inmate prison probably joined the riot, but he did not know how many. <PERSON> Rodolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Leon </PERSON>, the state attorney general, was quoted by reporters as saying a number of visitors, relatives and administrative personnel were among the hostages. <PERSON> Delgado </PERSON> talked by telephone with the inmates today in an effort to persuade them to free the hostages, said a state security official who demanded anonymity. The source said the inmates were offered an armored car so they could leave safely, but they rejected it. `` We do n't know exactly what they want,'' he said. <PERSON> Hector </PERSON> <PERSON> Batista </PERSON>, a volunteer, said he and a <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> team went into the prison today, retrieved the two bodies and took them to the local morgue, then went in again to pick up the injured. `` We went in the first time to take out the dead, they -LRB- the mutineers -RRB- were very nice. But the second time, they almost did n't let us go out,'' he said <PERSON> Batista </PERSON> said there were about 10 rioters, three of them armed with firearms, and the rest with knives, homemade blunt weapons and clubs. <PERSON> Salazar </PERSON> identified one victim as prison director <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarado </PERSON>.

 Foreign Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> today linked the crash of a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> jet in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> to Palestinian factions. An Israeli newspaper and terror experts blamed Syrian-backed radical groups opposed to the U.S.-PLO talks. The daily English-language newspaper The Nation quoted unidentified Western intelligence sources as saying the Syrian-backed <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON> group was responsible. It said investigators believed that at least one person aboard could be identified as belonging to <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON>'s Popular Front for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine-General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> group. Israeli officials bitterly opposed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision earlier this month to open a dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> after its chief, <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, renounced terrorism and recognized <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist. On Thursday, a senior <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> official, <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON>, said in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, that it was `` nonsensical'' to link Palestinians to the crash. In a report from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> today, a correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION>'s English service said passengers aboard the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> plane included two members of a secret <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> team returning from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> where they had negotiated for the release of American hostages A <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said today that two Americans on the plane were involved in diplomatic security, one at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, and another at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, and two other diplomats from the <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> embassy. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, denied that two of the Americans had been involved in talks on American hostages. <PERSON> Arens </PERSON>, interviewed in <LOCATION> Hebrew </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio, said that `` based on our assumptions, and those of our experts, this is an operation of international terror, apparently Arab international terror.'' <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> attacked the U.S.-PLO dialogue, saying `` such steps would only strenghten the wave of terror and encourage terror groups and activities.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said two Israelis died in the crash, and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> had sent a top police official to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to assist in the investigation. <PERSON> Ariel </PERSON> <PERSON> Merari </PERSON>, a senior researcher in terrorism at <ORGANIZATION> Tel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviv </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Jaffee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>, said the attack was apparently staged to block the U.S.-PLO talks. `` Radical Palestinian factions, who declared <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> a traitor, are the most likely candidates,'' <PERSON> Merari </PERSON> said in an interview. `` They likely had Syrian or Libyan backing.'' He said Palestinian groups were `` responsible for half of the mid-air plane bombings in the last 20 years'' and said <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON>'s group in particular had a `` rich history'' of such attacks He said <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON>'s followers were linked to the Feb. 21, 1970, downing of <ORGANIZATION> Swissair </ORGANIZATION> plane by a in-flight explosion, and on the same day unsuccessfully attempted to blow up an Austrian airlines plane. In 1971 and 1972, <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON> guerrillas made three attempts to detonate a bomb in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> El-Al </ORGANIZATION> planes, two in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> and one in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. In one case, the bomb was hidden in a record player. `` They usually use naive carriers, people who do n't suspect. In the case of <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON>, female tourists were befriended by <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON>'s men and asked to take a parcel to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Merari </PERSON> noted that a `` barometer bomb,'' which is equipped with an altitude-sensitive detonator and activated by air pressure, was found concealed in a radio when 13 Palestinians were detained in October during raids in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Officials there said the suspects belonged to <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON>'s group. The Nation said that the leader of the Jibril cell in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Kassem </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalkamony </PERSON>, told his interrogators the group planned attacks on civilian aircraft. A similar report was carried by <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION>'s military correspondent Thursday. The paper quoted West German intelligence sources as saying they believe a Jibril guerrilla boarded the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> plane in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>. It said the man board the plane `` with a briefcase packed with Syrian-supplied explosives that can not be detected by routine security methods'' and fled when the flight was in transit in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, leaving the briefcase behind. Meanwhile, the head of the <ORGANIZATION> Israeli </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonen </PERSON> said he warned the London-based <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in a telephone call earlier this month about a possible attack by radical Palestinians. `` I spoke with them a day after the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision to start talks with <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> -LRB- Dec. 15 -RRB- and warned them that we may expect an increase in attacks by groups opposing these talks,'' <PERSON> Gonen </PERSON> said. `` It was a general warning, because I did not have any precise information.''

 A West German official said today that police discovered an air pressure-activated bomb during the October arrests of suspected radical Palestinians, but he emphasized it was too soon to say whether there was any connection to the crash of a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> jet. `` It's pure speculation,'' said <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Prechtel </PERSON>, spokesman for the chief federal prosecutor's office. The bomb is set off by a drop in air pressure, such as those occurring in the luggage compartment of an airplane, he said. New York-bound <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 originated in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> and landed in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, where passengers changed from a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 to the ill-fated <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747. Wednesday's crash in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, which killed 258 people on board and at least 22 people on the ground, apparently occurred after the plane broke up for an unknown reason at an altitude of 31,000 feet. The <ORGANIZATION> Neue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presse </ORGANIZATION> newspaper of <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> reported today on alleged lapses in security checks at <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> airport. The newspaper quoted an unidentified expert as saying it's `` problem-free to smuggle a bomb on board.'' `` If the explosives and detonator are taken on board separately, it's all child's play,'' the newspaper quoted the expert as saying. The paper quoted an unidentified baggage handler as saying that not every bag is subjected to an X-ray scan, and that only random samplings are made. <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwalm </PERSON>, the spokesman for the airport, declined comment on the report, noting that security is handled by <PERSON> Hesse </PERSON> state officials. The Associated Press called the office of security chief <PERSON> Horst </PERSON> <PERSON> Harnstein </PERSON>, and was told he was not available to talk. But on Thursday, <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Neusel </PERSON>, the No. 2 official in the federal <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, strongly defended security at <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> airport. <PERSON> Arno </PERSON> <PERSON> Falk </PERSON>, a spokesman for the federal police office in <LOCATION> Wiesbaden </LOCATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that West German investigators were checking details of the crash and were in contact with investigators in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. Since the crash, there have been growing indications the flight was sabotaged. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the Independent newspaper today quoted a security source as saying investigators were taking `` very seriously'' a pro-Iranian group's letter that it was responsible for the crash. However, <PERSON> Prechtel </PERSON> brought up the issue of 13 Palestinians rounded up in a series of raids in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in October. Three were later arrested, while the others were set free but remain under investigation. <PERSON> Prechtel </PERSON> said in a telephone interview that the arrested suspects belonged to the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command. `` They have said they planned attacks against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interests,'' <PERSON> Prechtel </PERSON> said of the suspected Popular Front members. The suspects allegedly set up a terrorist cell of the <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, authorities say. The Syrian-controlled faction is opposed to the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> leader, <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, and is headed by <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON>, a former Syrian army captain. <PERSON> Prechtel </PERSON> said officers in the town of <LOCATION> Neuss </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Duesseldorf </LOCATION> found in a car used by one member of the group a bomb activated by a drop in air pressure. `` Naturally, you can see a connection,'' <PERSON> Prechtel </PERSON> said when asked whether members of the group could have been involved in the crash of the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> plane. `` They may have built several of these bombs.'' He said the bomb that was discovered was hidden inside a radio, thus making it difficult to detect.

 Police have arrested a suspect in the slaying of a barber who was shot to death by a customer upset over his haircut. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, 34, of <LOCATION> Aurora </LOCATION>, was picked up Wednesday night in the investigation into the death of <PERSON> Bobbie </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Willis </PERSON>, said Detective <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyckoff </PERSON>.

The man refused to pay and grew so angry that police were summoned to the barber shop. The man paid $ 9 and left, but returned with a pistol and opened fire on <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> as he was calling police for help, authorities and witnesses said. Police had said the gunman was slender, in his 20s with very short hair and a 3-inch, crescent-shape scar on the back of his head. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> matched that description.

<HEAD>Court Upholds Convictions of Rebellious Officers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal appeals court convicted seven retired air force officers for attempting to take over an airport following an army insurrection in January. The three-member court rejected the officers' arguments that they tried to seize <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <LOCATION> Newberry </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> to prevent a civil war. One officer testified that they wanted to stop an air force attack on rebellious army units at <LOCATION> Monte </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caseros </LOCATION>, 310 miles northeast of the capital. The army units later surrendered. Thursday's decision by the appeals court came after the nation's highest military tribunal convicted the seven of mutiny and sentenced them The appeals court convicted the men on the more serious charge of aggravated rebellion. Most received stiffer sentences. Under Argentine law, the appeals court can rule on any charges or assign its own penalties independent of lower or military court rulings. Retired Col. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Estrella </PERSON>'s sentence of 12 years was upheld, while the sentences of Lt. Cols. <PERSON> Horacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Ricciardelli </PERSON>, <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Puy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Angel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lavella </PERSON> were increased to 11 years each. Under the military tribunal, <PERSON> Puy </PERSON> had received an eight-year sentence, and <LOCATION> Lavella </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Ricciardelli </PERSON> seven years each. Lt. Col. <PERSON> Ernesto </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON>, Maj. <PERSON> Higinio </PERSON> <PERSON> Ribles </PERSON> and Capt. <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> all received sentences of six years, eight months; as did <PERSON> Godofredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Buschiazzo </PERSON>, an enlisted man in the navy. <PERSON> Ribles </PERSON> had originally received a seven-year sentence, and <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> and <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> received five years each. <PERSON> Buschiazzo </PERSON>'s term was increased from one to five years. Lt. Col. <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Magni </PERSON>, who had argued he did not participate in the takeover, was acquitted. He had received a three-year sentence from the military tribunal. The convicted servicemen will spend their terms in military custody. On Jan. 18, about 20 rebels seized the control tower, forcing the cancellation of some flights and the detour of others to <ORGANIZATION> Ezeiza </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION>, the largest in this city of 10 million. Rebels surrendered peacefully after four hours. <PERSON> Estrella </PERSON> told the court that he and the others acted to prevent the air force attack against the rebels in <LOCATION> Monte </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caseros </LOCATION>. `` On Jan. 18, the country was heading towards a civil war and something had to be done to prevent the repression the air force was ready to launch on the rebels,'' <PERSON> Estrella </PERSON> said. The army insurrection was led by Lt. Col. <PERSON> Aldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rico </PERSON>, now cashiered and imprisoned at an army garrison along with about 50 of his followers. None have been brought to trial. <PERSON> Rico </PERSON> also led an uprising in April 1987 to protest the trial of officers for human rights abuses stemming from the repression of subversion under the 1976-83 military dictatorship. That same concern prompted a third uprising against the civilian government of President <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> earlier this month.

 A Spanish soldier's souvenir grenade fuse blew up in the cargo bay of a DC-9 passenger jet today minutes after all passengers exited the plane, and officials said one person was slightly injured. The small explosion caused little damage to the interior of the jet operated by the Spanish domestic airline <ORGANIZATION> Aviaco </ORGANIZATION>, but a cargo handler was slightly injured, said an airport spokesman who demanded anonymity. `` Two Army soldiers on holiday leave from training in <LOCATION> Palma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Majorca </LOCATION> brought back as souvenirs two low-powered fuses, or caps, used to trigger rifle-fired anti-tank grenades during instruction,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> said. `` Although only one of the fuses exploded, both soldiers acted in a completely irresponsible way and contravened army rules in traveling with the fuses.''

The <ORGANIZATION> Aviaco </ORGANIZATION> DC-9 arrived from <LOCATION> Palma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Majorca </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Balearic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> shortly before the blast, the airport spokesman said The fuse exploded when a cargo handler moved one of the soldier's bags in the cargo bay, he said The handler suffered a slight injury.

 President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has nearly completed his Cabinet with a flurry of surprise announcements, naming a black educator, a conservationist, a retiring Hispanic lawmaker, a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official and a transit expert to key jobs. Only two Cabinet positions _ at the <ORGANIZATION> departments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> labor </ORGANIZATION> and energy _ remain unfilled. `` I'm not sure when those announcements will be forthcoming, but I would again say fairly soon,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Thursday after he picked five men for a variety of positions. So far he has named 12 Cabinet members. <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>, co-director of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s transition, said it was possible that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> might name additional people to his Cabinet today, and, `` If not, we'll wait until the first of the year.'' <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>, speaking on <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Today Show,'' said transition aides were talking to people about jobs on Thursday night, and again today. Besides the labor and energy departments, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is looking for his new drug czar, <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> said. Among those mentioned as possible choices for labor secretary are <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON>, a federal communications commissioner, and <PERSON> Constance </PERSON> <PERSON> Horner </PERSON>, head of the Office of Personnel Management. In the running for the energy slot are former <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Henson </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> and <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, former head of the <ORGANIZATION> Bonneville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will be working in his office today, but he has no public schedule. He plans to spend the Christmas weekend with his family at the vice president's house before leaving Monday on a four-day hunting and fishing trip to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>. Two of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s Cabinet choices, Dr. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> as secretary of health and human services, and <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> as head of the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, were expected in advance. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, 55, the president of <ORGANIZATION> Morehouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> and the first black chosen for the Cabinet, publicly reassured anti-abortion activists that he opposes abortions except in cases of rape, incest or when the life of the mother is threatened. He said his views run parallel to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s on the issue. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s appointment ran into a roadblock earlier in the week after he was quoted in a newspaper article saying he supported a woman's right to have an abortion. On Thursday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> praised <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s `` long and extremely distinguished career.'' <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>, 50, a former prosecutor and head of the <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northeastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION>, the second largest transportation system in the nation, had been expected to get the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration job. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> described <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> as an `` effective and visionary transportation leader.'' The president-elect made three unexpected announcements, picking retiring Rep. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.M. </LOCATION>, to head the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>; former <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> for veterans affairs, and conservationist <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> as administrator of the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> does not have Cabinet status, though <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>'s mission is one of `` tremendous importance,'' and he added: `` I expect to be a very active president in protecting the environment. The selection of <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>, 48, a native of <LOCATION> Decatur </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, who is president of the <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> affiliate of the World Wildlife Fund, was cheered by environmentalists. `` A brilliant choice,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Pritchard </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>, a Harvard-trained lawyer, said he thought he was the first conservationist selected for the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> post. Former colleagues of <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON>'s said they were surprised by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s pick but thought the undersecretary of state for security assistance, science and technology would do a good job at the new Department of Veterans Affairs. `` His name had never even surfaced,'' said Rep. <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>, D-Miss., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON>, 62, a World War II veteran, knew <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> when the two served in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in the early 1970s. He lost his seat after redistricting in 1982, and since then he has held a variety of jobs at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Another unexpected move came when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> selected <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON>, 60, for <ORGANIZATION> interior </ORGANIZATION> secretary. A veteran of two decades in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> is the second Hispanic in the Cabinet, joining Education Secretary <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON>, who did not seek re-election, was a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>. Meantime, transition aides refused to comment on a report in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has picked <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Gelb </PERSON>, an executive of <ORGANIZATION> Bristol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Myer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, as head of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. In a question-and-answer session with reporters, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was asked about a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> statement that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassies had been informed of a terrorist threat against <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> more than two weeks before a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> plane en route to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> crashed in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> on Wednesday. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said most threats `` never materialize,'' but if there were `` hard evidence that a specific flight was going to be threatened or that the threat could not be contained, clearly you would want to serve the public good by notifying people.'' On anther topic, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was asked whether he would consider military action to destroy a <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> chemical weapon factory _ an option that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in a television interview had suggested was under consideration. He said he would work with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allies to see that the plant was not built, but he refused to be specific.

The couple had been discussing how Ms. <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, 21, could protect herself from intruders, and <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> gave her the shotgun to use in practice, deputies said. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> apparently had loaded the gun and disengaged a safety.

After giving her the gun, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> left the room and returned posing as an intruder, police said. Ms. <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> pointed the shotgun at <ORGANIZATION> Williams </ORGANIZATION> and lightly squeezed the trigger, causing the gun to discharge. Ms. <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> then phoned police to report the shooting. Detectives who were called to the home concluded that the shooting was accidental, <PERSON> Higgs </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Commercial Radio Stations Face Indefinite Shutdown</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LISBON, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Christmas Eve will be `` Silent Night'' for almost 800 pirate radio stations slated to shut down indefinitely as part of a government plan to restructure broadcasting. The center-right Social Democrat government has ordered the Saturday closure while it evaluates offers from stations for control of 430 frequencies that will be available for local broadcast in 1989. `` Final offers have to be submitted by Jan. 3. But the problem is -LRB- the government -RRB- has n't said how long stations will be closed for,'' said <PERSON> Emidio </PERSON> <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON>, director of TSF, a major commercial station that will close one day before the deadline to allow its employees to spend Christmas with their families. <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON> said between 2,000 and 3,000 people could lose their jobs because of the closure. Pirate stations began broadcasting on the FM band in 1977 but, with names like <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unforeseen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chaos </ORGANIZATION>, most were amateur. Successive governments tolerated the pirates, and the unregulated stations boomed. TSF, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>'s most popular station among listeners in the 25-45 age group, boasted a closing program Friday with live interviews with President <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Soares </PERSON>, marathon star <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Mota </PERSON> and leading politicians. The station, set up in February this year with a capital of $ 690,000, has no plans to lay off its 75-strong staff, said TSF journalist <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Marinho </PERSON>. Prime Minister <PERSON> Anibal </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavaco </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> is committed long-term to liberalizing the state national broadcasting monopoly, but the government plans to hand over only one frequency to a national commercial network at a future date. The government has been criticized for reallocating the local stations, while leaving state - and church-controlled national networks intact

 Legislators gave final approval Friday to a law intended to track and prevent the spread of AIDS. The law, to take effect next year, would require doctors to report to local governors the name, age and sex of any AIDS patient and how the victim contracted the disease, said an official at the research office of the <ORGANIZATION> Standing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>, a government agency. The law also authorize governors to fine anyone refusing to be tested for AIDS up to $ 800, and to punish doctors who disclose information about AIDS patients to anyone but the governor's office, said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity. He said the law provides for banning entry to any foreigner believed likely to engage in activities that could spread acquired immune deficience syndrome, although AIDS tests are not mandatory for foreigners. Most opposition members voted against the bill, saying it would lead to people avoiding seeing their doctors. The government says 50 people have died of AIDS in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> as of Aug. 31, with 90 confirmed AIDS patients and 1,048 known carriers of the virus.

<HEAD>High Prices, Shoddy Goods Discourage Christmas Shoppers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Colored lights and tinsel add a twinkle to the drab store windows, but holiday shoppers' spirits often sink once they scour aisles of shoddy goods and gasp at the prices. For many Poles, this year's Christmas rush through rainy streets under leaden skies caps a year of economic and political discontent. Constant price increases and inflation have eroded the value of the zloty and shortages send shoppers scampering to better stocked stores in nearby <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The authorities have tried to stock the markets before the three-day Christmas holiday that starts with `` Wigilia,'' or `` Vigil,'' _ the traditional 12-dish meatless meal that begins when the first star appears on the evening of Dec. 24. Thousands of people crowded the cavernous hall at <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Hala </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirowska </ORGANIZATION> market Friday amid piles of oranges, nuts, and prunes. Outside, trucks unloaded Christmas trees and farmers sold spruce garlands from the country. At one meat counter, four saleswomen chatted as about 50 customers in line ignored old sausages hanging on hooks and waited for the next meat delivery in hopes of obtaining hams or smoked pork. The situation in the stores is `` very bad, especially meat,'' said <PERSON> Zdzislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kilinski </PERSON>, a private businessman. `` Soon the government will end meat -LRB- ration -RRB- coupons, prices will be higher, and I think they are saving the meat until then.'' In general, customers complained about the lack of good quality TVs, radios and clothes in state stores, and said they could n't afford prices in private shops One effort at a major <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> department store to provide a better selection of goods frustrated and angered some shoppers _ because it accepted only Western hard-currency _ and police had to cordon off one newly opened, well-stocked store in a provincial city to prevent a near-riot by the heavy flow of customers. Shoppers at the three-story Junior department store in downtown <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> enter another world when the escalator stops at the second floor. Under bright fluorescent lights, the shelves are laden with brand-name Western household appliances, ski boots, and fashionable evening clothes. But because all items in the state-run store are priced in dollars and must be paid for in hard currency, many Poles will still have to buy the shabby stitchings one floor down. The shortage in normal stores of good toys, pretty clothes and fragrant scents has led more than 5,000 customers to part with their precious dollars since the floor opened for business on Monday, said the floor manager, <PERSON> Mariusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Dobrzynski </PERSON>. Long lines have also formed at the <LOCATION> Pewex </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Baltona </LOCATION> dollar stores for champagne, wine and vodka. The biggest lines were for games and toys from the West: tennis rackets, erector sets and dolls. In the city of <LOCATION> Bielsko-Biala </LOCATION>, police were called in to restore order after an avalanche of customers tried to pour through the doors of the newly opened <PERSON> Klimczok </PERSON> department store, the state-run news agency <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> reported. The department store in the <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s southern highlands is being hailed as the country's biggest. When it opened last week, a near-riot erupted and Polish TV showed scenes of one shopper who got a bloody nose in the tumult. Others were shown being carried out after apparently fainting. The official <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> news agency complained that professional buyers were scarfing up anying on the shelves, and the goods appeared the next day at inflated prices on the <LOCATION> Bielsko-Biala </LOCATION> flea market. Another shopping store in <LOCATION> Lodz </LOCATION>, in central <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, was serving 200,000 customers a day and taking in the equivalent of $ 340,000 daily. The Christmas bying season was seen by the new government of Prime Minister <PERSON> Mieczyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> as a test of its ability to improve public moods. The government spent millions of zlotys to purchase extra supplies of holiday goods like oranges, lemons, bananas and raisins, and supplies of other traditional Christmas foods like carp and imported wines from <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. Shoppers at <ORGANIZATION> Hala </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirowska </ORGANIZATION> said that in terms of most holiday food the government had largely succeeded. `` Not so bad, as you can see,'' said one woman standing in line for holiday poppy-seed cakes. But for hams, better meats and consumer goods for giving as presents, there was disappointment. `` There are no boots and a lot of things you need for life,'' said <PERSON> Kilinski </PERSON>. `` Maybe it could have been better.''

<HEAD>Vatican Rebukes Catholic Clinics For Using `Test-Tube' Conception</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FRANCES D'EMILIO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> said Friday that Roman Catholic university clinics were challenging church teaching by continuing research into test-tube conception, which the church rejects. An editorial in the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>'s newspaper, <PERSON> L'Osservatore </PERSON> <PERSON> Romano </PERSON>, said the church feels determined `` as never before'' to safeguard the common good against `` technological manipulation of the very fonts of life.'' `` The oscillations and discord in the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> camp have contributed to rendering the question more complex,'' said the editorial. `` Above all, the gravity of the decision of several <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> university clinics to continue, under certain conditions, the practive of homologous ` in vitro' fertilizaton, can not be undervalued.'' `` Such resolve, from the moment it was made public, has become a challenge as well,'' the newspaper said. In January, a <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> meeting failed to resolve a dispute between the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> and three <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> universities in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> on researching test-tube conception. In 1987, a <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> document approved by Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> had condemned test-tube conception, surrogate motherhood and experimentation on live embryos. It also branded as immoral the freezing of embryos, cloning, attempts to fashion animal-human hybrids and the implanation of embryos in artificial or animal uteruses. Shortly after the document's publication, the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lille </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, announced it will continue experiments with `` in-vitro'' fertilization to help couples who otherwise could n't have children The January meeting was with rectors of the <LOCATION> Lille </LOCATION> institution, <ORGANIZATION> Universite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholique </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louvain </ORGANIZATION>, in <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION>'s Katholieke Universiteit of <LOCATION> Nijmegen </LOCATION> Roman Catholic teaching holds that the only moral way to create human life is normal sexual acts between a married couple. In `` in vitro'' methods, an egg is taken from a woman's ovary and united with sperm outside the womb. When life begins to grow, the fertilized egg is then implanted in a womb. Referring to the universities' decision, the editorial continued: `` The directors of this ... very serious rebellion, try still to justify themselves by claiming to respect the Roman teaching.'' The editorial said the clinics claim not to understand the reasons for the stance of the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>'s Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. The congregation is the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>'s watchdog for doctrinal orthodoxy. The newspaper asserted that use of artificial birth control ended up being an incentive for abortion, and that similarly `` it is becoming evident that artifical procreation puts as its operating premise'' discriminating cultural choices as to what kind of babies would be born.

 A bouquet of red tulips lay on the steps of <ORGANIZATION> Syracuse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s study center as students and teachers ended a memorial service Friday for classmates killed in the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> crash. They hugged one another and wept, clustered in small groups outside the gray stone church where the morning service was held, and met at the elegant mansion that houses their school across the street. `` They had such a passionate interest in life and a desire to make the world better,'' <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Ingrim </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Syracuse </ORGANIZATION> drama professor, said as he remembered the six he taught and the other students killed in the crash Wednesday night. `` When all that is snuffed out in 30 seconds it's impossible to make any sense of it,'' he said. `` It's shattering.'' The 35 <ORGANIZATION> Syracuse </ORGANIZATION> students were among 258 people who died when the New York-bound <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 crashed in the Scottish village of <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION> on Wednesday. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, an English major from <LOCATION> Kennett </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, heard the news Wednesday night while in a pub with friends. `` It was n't real, I could n't believe it,'' he said. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> shared a house with six friends including <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON>, a student from <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, who died in the crash. Like others, he knew just about all 270 students on the close-knit <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> program. The students were chosen for the program for their academic ability, and studied at the 19th century mansion on fashionable <LOCATION> Ladbroke </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grove </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Syracuse </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION> professors. The term ended Dec. 17, and most had already gone home when the crash occurred. After a friend got a call from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and went to the pub to tell them, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> and the others raced to the study center to wait for news. Sometime past midnight, they learned the students had made the flight, and that there were no survivors. `` It still is n't real. You keep expecting <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> to walk through the door,'' he said, his hands in his pockets and his eyes downcast. Asked what she was like, he said, `` She was the happiest person alive.'' <PERSON> Kristin </PERSON> <PERSON> Huffmon </PERSON>, a junior from <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, said Ms. <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> was studying photography and had always said, half-jokingly, that her dream was to work for National Geographic magazine. `` Does n't every photojournalism student want to work for National Geographic? That was <PERSON> Amy </PERSON>'s ` joke,''' said Ms. <PERSON> Huffmon </PERSON>, a political science major. <PERSON> Ingrim </PERSON>, who is originally from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, said three of his students _ <PERSON> Theodora </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Miriam </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Nicole </PERSON> <PERSON> Boulanger </PERSON> _ were planning to set up a theater troupe at school upon their return. Three others, <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Coker </PERSON>, <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardwell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Turhan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ergin </PERSON>, also studied drama under him. `` They were all extremely gifted,'' he said. `` When I see kids of such promise and energy ... I can not imagine how the parents are feeling right now. I just ca n't imagine.'' At the memorial service at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION>'s church in west <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, vicar <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Stringer </PERSON> and a local rabbi, <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> Tabick </PERSON>, led the small group through prayers and hymns. They read out the names of those lost and observed a moment of silence.

 <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> today blamed terrorists for the crash of the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> jetliner in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, condemning it as an `` inhuman criminal action'' that undermines the peace process in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. At a news conference at the end of his one-day visit to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> made his first public comment on the crash of the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 in <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, that killed all 258 people aboard and at least 22 on the ground. `` This is an inhuman criminal action which we condemn,'' <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said. `` It is against our peace mission. It is not against a state, it is directed against humanity as a whole. It is another proof that we should all fight against this type of terrorist act.'' `` We join other nations in an effort to stop this terrorism and criminal acts,'' he added. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last week reversed a 13-year policy and opened a `` substantive dialogue'' with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> after <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> renounced terrorism and accepted <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have said the talks will be scuttled if there is proof of <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> involvement in terrorism. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said he was `` very sad'' because the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> crash claimed the life of `` one of my friends,'' referring to <PERSON> Bernt </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlsson </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official involved in negotiations for independence of <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. `` I send my heart-felt condolences to all the victims of this crime.'' Investigators in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> are trying to determine if the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> plane was destroyed by a bomb. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on Friday linked the crash to Palestinian factions. `` I am really astonished that rumors were directed against the Palestinians only,'' <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said. Asked whether he could control terrorist <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> and other radical Palestinian factions, he said: `` These groups are not Palestinian groups. They follow the intelligence of several Arab and other states.'' <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said he could only account for groups and individuals `` under the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> flag.'' He claimed the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> secret service Mossad was trying to undermine the U.S.-PLO dialogue. `` According to my information the <ORGANIZATION> Mossad </ORGANIZATION> has already received their orders from the Israeli government to sabotage the peace process,'' he said. He did not elaborate. `` It is very important for everyone to know we are pushing to achieve peace, not only the Palestinian leadership but our masses,'' <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said. `` We are against all forms of terrorism.'' He said <ORGANIZATION> Mossad </ORGANIZATION> and other groups posed a greater threat. `` All of us have to coordinate -LRB- efforts -RRB- to face all forms of terrorism,'' he said.

 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> told <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> during a 20-minute meeting Friday he believes Palestinians and Jews have `` an identical fundamental right'' to their own countries, the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> said. He also called for negotiations and urged Israelis and <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> to live in peace `` in that land where the Prince of Peace was born,'' <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> spokesman <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> said the pontiff and the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> chairman had a `` cordial'' talk. This audience did not provoke the protest from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and Jewish groups caused by the one <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> was granted six years ago. In mild criticism, spokesman <PERSON> Alon </PERSON> <PERSON> Liel </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said: `` Peace in the holy land can hardly be served by such a meeting.'' Israeli leaders also have met with <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, but the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> does not have formal relations with the Jewish state, citing <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s unsettled boundaries and the Palestinian problem as reasons. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> appeared more receptive to <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> this time, greeting him in the private library where he usually sees heads of state and other dignitaries. In 1982, they talked in a small room in the modern <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> VI </PERSON> audience hall. A <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> statement said the pontiff met <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> `` in order to encourage dialogue, the only means to find an equitable solution to the <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> conflict, ruling out every form of recourse to arms and violence and above all, terrorism and reprisals.'' It said: `` The <PERSON> pope </PERSON> expressed his hope that both peoples would soon see the beginning of a real process of understanding and of peace, which would put an end finally to their suffering and their fears. `` The holy father reiterated that he was profoundly convinced that the two peoples had an identical fundamental right to their own homelands in which they could live in liberty, dignity and security, in harmony with the neighboring peoples.'' <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s meeting with <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> occurred after the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief conferred with Italian government leaders. He is touring <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to seek support for an international <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace conference and the independent <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state proclaimed Nov. 15. <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> told reporters <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> briefed the pope on <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> developments and that <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> asked questions, but would not provide details. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> has long supported some form of homeland for Palestinians. The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> reacted warmly to the call for a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state and praised the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for deciding to talk with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> after <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> recognized <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and renounced terrorism. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, in turn, has looked to the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> for support. Palestinian leaders said the <PERSON> pope </PERSON>'s first meeting with <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> six years ago sas a turning point in the organization's search for international recognition. Four aides accompanied <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> to the Friday audience, including <PERSON> Farouk </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaddoumi </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> political department. With <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> was a priest who translated <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s Arabic into Italian. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> gave the pontiff a carved wooden nativity scene and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> gave the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chairman a book about the Vatican. Earlier Friday, <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> met with Premier <PERSON> Ciriaco </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Mita </PERSON> and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Giulio </PERSON> <PERSON> Andreotti </PERSON> at the premier's office. <PERSON> Andreotti </PERSON> said the meeting `` confirmed the moderate line'' taken by the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, an umbrella organization of several Palestinian groups, including <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION>. He said <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> gave `` a very positive evaluation'' of talks with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which ended a 13-year ban by <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on contacts with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. A statement from <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Mita </PERSON>'s office reaffirmed <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s support for an international <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace conference.

 The cockpit recording of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103's last minutes ended abruptly after a faint noise, and conversations among the crew gave no clues about what caused the plane to crash, officials said today. `` There is nothing in the conversations -LRB- of the flight crew -RRB- to indicate anything was wrong,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> McKie </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. `` There is a faint noise at the end which needs a bit more analysis. There is no indication what that noise is. It would be quite wrong to jump to any conclusions,'' he said. The cockpit recording and flight data tapes from the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 were being analyzed by the department's Air Accident Investigation Branch. British and American investigators sifted through crash debris as relatives of some of the 258 victims aboard the jumbo jet gathered in a nearby town. The noise is heard on the recorder that preserves the last 30 minutes of conversation in the cockpit. The other recorder monitors flight data. <PERSON> McKie </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> there was nothing abnormal on the tapes up to the moment they cut off. `` There were no abnormal noises on the tape until the signals ended abruptly with the aircraft cruising at 31,000 feet.'' Although <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassies in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> had received warnings that a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> plane would be bombed, the chief British investigator at <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, the Scottish village where the plane crashed, said no evidence of a bomb had been found yet. <PERSON> Mick </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> of the Air Accident Investigation Branch told a news conference: `` We have no evidence whatsoever yet of sabotage,'' but added this did not mean sabotage was ruled out. He said the spread of debris over many miles was `` not unusual,'' since the plane was six miles high and winds were 115 knots. `` In these circumstances a lot of the debris is going to be sent a very long distance.'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, an aviation safety consultant and former investigator for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, said a cockpit recording that appears normal until the end could indicate an explosion knocked out communications, electricity and perhaps even severed the cockpit from the aircraft. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> made his comments in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Thursday, before cockpit data from the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> flight was released. While aviation experts were reluctant to provide details, it is generally known that an explosive device placed in certain areas of the baggage compartment of a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 could wipe out computer, electrical and communications systems as well as possibly incapacitate the flight crew. In <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> today linked the crash to Palestinian factions. An Israeli newspaper and terror experts blamed Syrian-backed radical groups opposed to the U.S.-PLO dialogue. <PERSON> Arens </PERSON>, interviewed in <LOCATION> Hebrew </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio, said that `` based on our assumptions, and those of our experts, this is an operation of international terror, apparently Arab international terror.'' <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, today blamed terrorists for the crash of the jetliner, condemning it as an `` inhuman criminal act'' that undermines the peace process in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> made his first public comments on the crash at a news conference in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, where he concluded a one-day visit. He said, `` We join other nations in an effort to stop this terrorism and criminal acts.'' `` I am really astonished that rumors were directed against the Palestinians only,'' he said, and accused the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> secret service, Mossad, of trying to undermine the U.S.-PLO dialogue. The Israeli newspaper The Nation quoted unidentified Western intelligence sources as saying the Syrian-backed <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON> group was responsible. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, said four Americans on board the plane were <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> employees. A <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said two were involved in diplomatic security, one at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, and the other at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Two others were diplomats assigned to the <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> embassy, he said. The official said an Israeli radio report that two of the Americans had been involved in negotiations to secure the release of American hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> was `` totally false.'' In <LOCATION> Carlisle </LOCATION>, 33 miles from <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, relatives of the 258 people who died on the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 began gathering to identify the remains of loved ones. Another 22 people reportedly died on the ground at <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>. Townspeople stood in a heavy rain today solemnly reading the lists of the missing. About 70 bodies found by search parties still lay outdoors and about 80 were placed in a makeshift morgue in the town hall while investigators from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yard </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> joined the search. The sudden catastrophe that made the plane break up over a wide patch of Scottish countryside pointed either to major structural failure or a bomb, and aviation experts agreed the latter was most likely. Speculation about a terrorist attack was fueled by a threat received Dec. 5 by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sources believed was linked to the <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> group of Palestinian radicals. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said an anonymous caller told the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> flight bound for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, would be targeted. Flight 103 originated in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>. In addition, an anonymous caller to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> on Thursday claimed a pro-Iranian group called Guardians of the <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolution </ORGANIZATION> planted a bomb on the plane. The caller said the motive was revenge for the July downing of an Iranian jetliner in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warship <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has denied involvement in the crash. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sessions </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> he had reports of numerous callers claiming responsibility, including some who claimed affiliation with terrorist groups. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON> II and <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> minister <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Rifkind </PERSON>, the secretary of state for <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, both said after inspecting the wreckage they were convinced an explosion occurred. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> sent four investigators to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> sent three observers.

 An <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> jumbo jet bound for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with 250 people aboard returned to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> today after a bomb threat. Also today, a terminal at <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> was evacuated after officials spotted a suspicious suitcase, and a <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tristar </ORGANIZATION> flew to <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> after a bomb threat forced it to make an unscheduled stop in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> on Thursday. All three incidents followed Wednesday's explosion of a New York-bound <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 over the Scottish village of <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>. All 258 people aboard were killed along with at least 22 people on the ground. After <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> Flight 109, a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747, had taken off for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> at 2:59 p.m. <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> received a bomb threat from an anonymous caller, said an airline spokesman, who demanded anonymity. The bomb threat, as a matter of routine, was passed to the captain of Flight 109 who decided to return to <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION>, the spokesman said. The 747 landed at 4:21 p.m. and taxied to an isolated area southwest of the terminals where emergency services were standing by, the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airports </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> said. Passengers left the plane normally and were taken by bus to terminal three where they were being kept in two rooms. The airline spokesman said the plane would be thoroughly searched. Earlier today, an unattended suitcase prompted officials to evacuate hundreds of Christmas travelers from terminal three, but a bomb squad found the bag contained just clothing, airport officials said. The British Airports Authority said the suitcase was found about noon today next to an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> check-in desk, just one aisle away from the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> check-in counter. Police said they were told that a man walked into the terminal, left the suitcase, and drove off again. In the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> incident, authorities closed <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>'s main <PERSON> Leonardo </PERSON> <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Vinci </PERSON> airport for 20 minutes Thursday while the plane made an emergency landing and its 242 passengers and 12 crew disembarked at an isolated area. The aircraft and the luggage were examined, but no bomb was found, said <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Blunt </PERSON>. A caller to the airline's <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> office said a bomb was on board, he said. Flight 146 originated in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>, made a stopover in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and was flying to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> when it was diverted. Blunt said fog had delayed the Tristar for four hours in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>. About four hours after leaving <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, passengers said the pilot told them he was landing in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> because one of his engines `` looked suspicious.'' Unaware of the bomb threat, most passengers sat in strained silence while the aircraft descended, then broke into applause on touchdown about four miles from the <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> terminal. Passengers then were told to leave the aircraft immediately. Outside, the tarmac was swarming with security officials, Italian police and firefighters, passengers said.

 Three teen-agers found half a million dollars in travelers' checks in the hills near their home when they searched for wreckage of the crashed <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> jet, police said Friday. <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, 14; his 13-year-old brother, <PERSON> Robbie </PERSON>; and friend <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyslop </PERSON>, 14, scoured the area around their home at <LOCATION> Grange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tundergarth </LOCATION>, six miles from <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION> on Thursday, the day after the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 broke up in the air and scattered wreckage over a wide area. The boys came across the checks in a brown envelope, said <PERSON> Forster </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, father of <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robbie </PERSON>. `` The checks were all tied together in a big brown envelope that was torn and damaged. They were all travelers' checks _ there were no dollar bills,'' he said. `` Some of the checks were for several thousand dollars. It seemed to be official mail _ the package said something like ` <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mail </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>' and on it was written how much was inside _ $ 547,000.'' The boys took the envelope to their home and gave it to police.

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Commandos with explosive charges attacked the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> and military headquarters in the capital today, military sources said. No casualties were immediately reported. It was the first time the installation, which houses the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> and the joint chiefs of staff, was attacked during <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s nine-year guerrilla war. The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, gave no other details. Radio reports indicated that two car bombs detonated near the walled compound in the southwest part of the city, but the reports could not be immediately confirmed. No one claimed responsibility, but the attackers were presumed to be members of the <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, a left-wing insurgency trying to overthrow the government. In the last year, it has attacked installations in the capital with car bombs and catapult-launched homemade bombs. Earlier in the day, unidentified terrorists killed a night watchman and set off three bombs, destroying the interior of the biology lab building at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, an official at the institution said. The official told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that unidentified individuals cut through a metal fence before dawn to enter the campus in the capital's northwestern sector. The official, who commented on condition of anonymity, identified the slain watchman as <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Aguirre </PERSON>. No one claimed responsibility for the attack at the university, with 35,000 students the biggest in the country, and police said they had no clues on the identity of the attackers. The university has been the scene of demonstrations recently by leftist student unions demanding $ 1.2 million in additional appropriations to pay back salaries for December owed to teachers and workers. Students were also protesting the assassination last week of a woman director of a law faculty extension in the western city of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ana </LOCATION>. The interior of the building, including furniture, files, windows, ceilings and laboratory equipment, was virtually demolished by the blasts. Also today, five provincial town mayors resigned, bringing to 12 the number of mayors who quit during the past three months after receiving death threats from leftist guerrillas fighting for power. The guerrillas have assassinated nine mayors in 1988. They say the officials were `` executed'' for their part in implementing what the rebels call `` the U.S.-imposed counterinsurgency plan.''

 If a terrorist bomb brought down <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103, a 25-minute delay of the jet's departure from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> may provide investigators with their biggest advantage. It kept the wreckage on land, instead of falling into the ocean. The cause of Wednesday's crash that killed all 258 people on board and more than 20 on the ground has yet to be determined, but there were signs today pointing to an explosion. Witnesses saw a flash of light high in the sky as the jet plummeted toward the ground; there was no communication from the cockpit as would have been expected if the pilots encountered flight control problems, and the wreckage was strewn over miles of Scottish countryside with the cockpit section found more than three miles from other large parts of the aircraft. From <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, officials investigating the crash said today that the cockpit recording of the flight's last minutes ended abruptly after a faint noise. They also said conversations among the crew gave no clues about what caused the plane to crash. `` There is nothing in the conversations -LRB- of the flight crew -RRB- to indicate anything was wrong,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> McKie </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION>. The cockpit recording and flight data tapes from the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 were being analyzed by the department's Air Accident Investigation Branch. `` There is a faint noise at the end which needs a bit more analysis. There is no indication what that noise is,'' said <PERSON> McKie </PERSON>. But none of that is conclusive evidence that a bomb detonated aboard the jetliner. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said today that a public warning about the flight after an anonymous telephone call to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> would `` literally have closed down air traffic in the world.'' The president said he believes `` all precautions'' were taken in the warning which went to the airline and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassies. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, speaking in the rain outside the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> as he departed for <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> where he will spend the holidays, offered condolences to the families of the victims, calling for Christmas prayers for their loss. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said the caller to the embassy in <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> on Dec. 5 said that a bomb would be planted aboard a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> flight from <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> within two weeks. Flight 103 began in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> on a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727, then changed planes to a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. But there has been no evidence that the telephone tip was related to the crash of Flight 103. In addition, an anonymous caller to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> on Thursday claimed a pro-Iranian group called Guardians of the <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolution </ORGANIZATION> planted a bomb on the plane. The caller said the motive was revenge for the July downing of an Iranian jetliner in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warship <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION>, but <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has denied involvement in the crash. The wreckage of Flight 103 is expected to provide more definitive clues, and while it is strewn over miles of countryside, at least it is not hundreds of feet under wintry seas, some aviation experts noted. In other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> developments related to the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> crash: _ White House officials defended the process by which the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> warned <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassies _ but not the general public _ that a bomb threat had been made against <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> They said the government would review whether public notification should be considered in future such cases. _ President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that if there were `` hard evidence'' that a specific flight was threatened or that the threat could not be averted, the public should be warned Nevertheless, he said most such threats `` never materialize.'' _ <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sessions </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> there have been `` a number of calls'' from individuals _ some claiming to speak for various terrorist groups _ taking responsibility for the crash Sessions provided no specifics. Flight 103 had been airborne 54 minutes when it disappeared from radar screens while cruising at 31,000 feet over <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. It was about to head westbound over the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> when tragedy struck. Another half hour and the plane would have been well over water. `` You would have had another <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> situation,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, an aviation safety consultant and former longtime investigator for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. To many investigators, the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> tragedy appears to resemble the l985 crash of an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 off the Irish coast. That jumbo jet also plummeted from the sky from 31,000 feet without a hint of trouble from the pilots. But the wreckage landed in the ocean and salvage crews struggled for four months to gather pieces, including the `` black box'' recorders, that would provide clues. An analysis of the final split second of the voice recorder was key to Indian officials concluding that a bomb had exploded aboard the aircraft. The authorities probing the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> crash clearly will have more to work with. They already have found the critical `` black box'' recorders _ one that monitors cockpit conversation and noises and another that records aircraft performance. Investigators will pay close attention to how parts of the aircraft are bent, tangled and singed and whether there are signs of residue from an explosion. They also will search for fragments that might have been used as a detonator and closely examine luggage and parts of luggage for residue from an explosive. The `` black box'' recorders are likely to provide, as they do in most aviation crashes, the most critical evidence, say aviation experts. The tape from the cockpit recorder may be as important for what it does n't say as for what it does, say veteran investigators. Is there a fragmented sound of an explosion? Are there any exchanges between pilots about control problems? Did the tape suddenly stop with no evidence of an emergency or structural concern? If all seems normal right to the end, it will be strong evidence that a powerful explosion might have knocked out communications, electricity and perhaps even literally severed the cockpit from the rest of the aircraft, says <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>. `` If you lost all communications, lost all electrical power on and airplane, the pilots now are nothing more than passengers.'' It would not take a large amount of explosives to do the job, suggested a number of experts. `` If a bomb severs some major or important electrical wiring, or hydraulic lines or cables, you could lose your ability to control the airplane,'' noted <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazor </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. While aviation experts were reluctant to provide details that could be used as a primer for terrorism, it is generally known that if an explosive device _ even a small one _ can be placed in certain areas of the baggage compartment of a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747, it could wipe out critical computer, electrical and communications systems as well as possibly incapacitate the flight crew. Some safety experts say such a scenario explains the sudden loss of communications while the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> jet was at cruise altitude and its rapid fall and breakup while still in the sky. They point out that commercial jetliners have over the years been kept aloft for some time even when encountering major structural problems short of an explosion. In l985, the pilots of a <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 struggled to keep their plane flying for about 32 minutes after a failure in the rear cabin bulkhead caused rapid depressurization. The jet finally crashed into a mountain, killing 520 people aboard.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s sister asked his kidnappers Friday to release him for Christmas _ his fourth in captivity _ but acknowledged `` there is little hope in my heart.'' Pleading for the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> journalist and the 14 other foreigners held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Say </PERSON> declared in an open letter to the pro-Iranian captors: `` I pray for you to have the courage to bring this to a peaceful conclusion.'' Her appeal was published in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> newspapers. Nine of the hostages are Americans, including <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, the 41-year-old chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. He was seized by Shiite Moslem gunmen March 16, 1985, while returning home from a Saturday morning game of tennis, and has been held the longest. <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s most influential <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> cleric said Friday the case of the Western hostages should be settled if Iranian captives are freed and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> releases Palestinian and Lebanese prisoners. `` We are hearing these days many messages and calls for the release of the Western hostages,'' said <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Fadlallah </PERSON>, spiritual guide of <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- Party of God -RRB-, believed to be an umbrella organization for groups holding hostages. `` We have said time and again that we want this matter closed,'' <PERSON> Fadlallah </PERSON> said in a sermon at the Bir el-Abed mosque in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s southern slums, where most of the foreigners are thought to be held `` We add our voice to those calling for the release of the foreign hostages provided all captives, including Iranians in east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and Lebanese and Palestinians held by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, are also freed. `` There should be no distinction among kidnap victims. Let the cry be for the release of all hostages with no discrimination. Let's treat the case from its humanitarian angle Let us preserve the humanity of all of the captives.'' Three Iranian Embassy diplomats and their driver have been missing since they tried to flee Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> through the Christian eastern sector during <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 1982 invasion of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> They were stopped by Christian militiamen and are believed dead. Hundreds of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> and Lebanese guerrillas are in Israeli prisons. Eight daily newspapers, including <ORGANIZATION> An </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nidaa </ORGANIZATION>, which speaks for the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, published Mrs. Say's letter. She addressed it to `` the captors of <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'' and said: `` Please give <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> our message of love and concern during this Christmas season. Tell him that thousands pray every day for the hostages, their captors and the people of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.'' An Nahar, an independent daily, published it in English and Arabic. The others printed the Arabic translation. `` We published the English text as well to give <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> a chance to read what is addressed to him,'' an editor of An Nahar said, on condition of anonymity. Mrs. Say's letter also said: `` Traditionally this is a season of hope, peace and forgiveness, but there is little hope in my heart that I will see <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> and other hostages released during these Christmas holidays. `` It is difficult to sustain hope after almost four years of working and praying for freedom for <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> and the other hostages. Some days it seems we have made no progress and are farther from our goal than ever. `` We hear mixed messages from the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and we have no clear guidelines about what we should do or could do on behalf of these innocent men.'' Addressing her brother's kidnappers _ Islamic Jihad -LRB- Islamic Holy War -RRB- _ she said: `` Only you, their captors, can end this stalemate. We have all suffered enough. Please. May God be with you and peace be yours.'' Hundreds of Christmas greetings for the hostages from abroad arrived at <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s leftist newspaper as-Safir for the third straight year.

<TEXT>
 Hundreds of Israeli army troops moved into <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> on Friday to guard against violence as Christian pilgrims gather for Christmas celebrations. Holiday activities in this <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of 35,000 were to be reduced from previous years in sympathy with the yearlong <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> uprising against Israeli rule in the occupied territories. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has controlled the territories since the 1967 Middle East War, when it captured the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. Israeli troops took up positions on the roads into <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, in its central Manger Square and on roofs of the nearby market. The square is in front of the Church of the Nativity, which was built over the grotto where <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> was born. Helmeted soldiers manned rooftop machine gun posts, and dozens of military jeeps and trucks clogged the Manger Square parking lot. Army officials declined to say how many soldiers were sent to the area, citing security reasons. The pro-PLO underground leadership of the uprising has called on residents in the territories to strike on Saturday in remembrance of the 333 Palestinians killed in the revolt. Most have been shot to death in clashes with Israeli troops. Fourteen Israelis also have died. The strike was expected to close all shops and offices in the territories, including in <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>. In one deserted clothes shop Friday, a merchant named <PERSON> Khalad </PERSON> complained that `` <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> is being reoccupied by the army. I see more soldiers than I saw in 1967 when we were first occupied. How can people shop? They are afraid to leave their homes.'' He asked not to give his last name for fear of reprisal. In the center of <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, slogans painted on the wall by uprising supporters said `` Remain home on the 24th of December'' and `` Let's escalate the intefadeh,'' which is Arabic for uprising. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official said he expected <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s new coalition government to consider two ideas toward peace. One would be calling elections in the occupied territories to select Palestinian negotiators acceptable to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. The other is seeking a Soviet-American meeting to launch direct Arab-Israeli negotiations. The previous coalition government considered both options. The official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity, said <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leaders already have rejected the option of giving the occupied lands autonomy. Palestinians have demanded an independent state. <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>'s Palestinian mayor, <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> <PERSON> Freij </PERSON>, on Friday rejected Israel-sponsored elections. If the balloting is `` for the purpose of electing a new leadership to be parallel to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, I doubt very much that any Palestinian will participate,'' <PERSON> Freij </PERSON> said in an interview with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio. He called on Israeli leaders to open talks with representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> did last week. <PERSON> Freij </PERSON> earlier announced that most of the city's official Christmas celebrations would be canceled in <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> in solidarity with the uprising. There will be no municipal decorations and no Boy Scout parade, he said. But the Roman Catholic patriarch in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabbah </PERSON>, is scheduled to lead a religious procession through <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> streets on Saturday, and the <ORGANIZATION> Tourism </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> is sponsoring a Christmas Eve concert with choirs from <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Shiloh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. There are an estimated 35,000 Palstinian Christians in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> and about 100,000 Arab Christians in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Between 3,000 and 4,000 western Christians also live in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and surrounding areas. Also Friday in the occupied lands, three Palestinians were shot and injured in clashes with soldiers, hospital officials said. A 14-year-old boy was shot in the left leg following Friday Moslem prayers in the <LOCATION> Shati </LOCATION> refugee camp in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, a 16-year-old boy was shot in the left leg in the Nusseirat refugee camp in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and a 7-year-old boy was shot in the right leg in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, they said. The army said it was checking the reports.

<TEXT>
 Shortly after 9 a.m., a freak snowstorm hit the Stewards' house with fury, burying the green lawn and blooming rose <PERSON> bush </PERSON> and plastering the windows with white stuff. For $ 500, <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> <PERSON> Steward </PERSON> had bought his family a white Christmas. Since Dec. 13, the <ORGANIZATION> Riverside </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has shaved dozens of tons of ice to cover more than 20 green <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> lawns with inches of pure white snow. Under blue skies, palm trees and basking in 70-degree temperature, children who have grown up with surfboards and skateboards have tried out sleds and toboggans for the first time. While sun, sand and surf might sound attractive to Northerners shivering in their hats and mittens, Southern Californians apparently tire of the tanned life at Christmas time. An <LOCATION> Arcadia </LOCATION> shop sells plastic icicles that customers use to cover the front of their homes, and sales of spray-can snow are up. `` They like a little taste of the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>,'' says <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, general manager of the ice company, which usually blows its ice on vegetable trucks traveling to the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> in hot weather. As ice company owner <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Wittenmyer </PERSON> directed the blasting snow onto the Stewards' yard Thursday, 6-year-old <PERSON> Brett </PERSON> waited, wearing puffy blue mittens and Amazing Spiderman boots. Beside him, in pink ribbons, pink turtleneck, bib-overalls and Reeboks, was his girlfriend <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> <PERSON> Cunningham </PERSON>, 6, who already knew what the snow was for. `` I'm going to snow fight <PERSON> Brett </PERSON>,'' she said. <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> <PERSON> Steward </PERSON>, 31, said he had taken <PERSON> Brett </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON>, 31, to the mountains the year before for Christmas, and they had enjoyed playing in the snow. But this year's schedule _ <PERSON> Steward </PERSON> works as both a Costa Mesa firefighter-paramedic and a <LOCATION> Riverside </LOCATION> real estate agent _ did n't allow the time. `` So we decided to bring the snow here'' to the family home close to the <LOCATION> Mojave </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION>, he said. By 9:30 a.m., his <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England-style </LOCATION> home was sprinkled with five tons of snow that coated the roof and windows. It lay 6 inches deep on the lawn, blocking the front door. <PERSON> Brett </PERSON> and the neighborhood kids attempted a snowball battle. `` Some of his friends coming over have _ what do you call them? _ those little round things,'' <PERSON> Steward </PERSON> said. There's just not much need to know what toboggans are here, 50 miles inland from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. The company that coated <PERSON> Steward </PERSON>'s yard has had calls from 60 miles west in <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, since news broke of their mini-blizzards. They are booked solid for Christmas Eve and have lined up jobs for New Year's and Valentine's Day. The minimum snow-job costs $ 300 for 20 300-pound blocks of ice that are shaved into three tons of snow. Last week, the company put 15 tons of snow on a <LOCATION> Moreno </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> lawn for a neighborhood block party. The snow, which consists of fine ice pellets similar to snow cone ice, lasts for two to three days without rain, about one day with rainfall. The green grass usually survives despite the cold shower. <PERSON> Wittenmyer </PERSON> said the ice company has made more snow in the past two weeks than in all his 15 years at the company, all because his wife, <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON>, ran an ad for the usually low-key business in the newspaper. `` It's just gone wild,'' he said. But as a transplanted Ohioan, <PERSON> Wittenmyer </PERSON> sees the irony in his new business. `` I came to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> to get out of that stuff,'' he said. What would the folks back home think now? `` They're going to think I'm really a whiz kid selling ice and snow to Californians.''

<HEAD>New Group Looking For Control of Baptist Convention</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A centrist coalition of <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptists </ORGANIZATION> has launched a bid to win over members of the nation's largest <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> denomination, which has been torn for a decade between conservatives and more liberal members. The 14.6 million-member church has been divided since 1979 over how literally the Bible must be accepted, with conservatives, who believe every account in the Bible actually happened, controlling the denomination's hierarchy. Last week, a group calling itself Baptists Committed to the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> threw its hat into the ring, promoting itself as an alternative between the two sides. Its goals, say organizers, are to educate grass-roots Baptists about issues in the denomination and to win control away from the conservatives. `` If there's an identifiable group, which believes in Southern Baptist polity and <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> principles of the separation of church and state, the priesthood of the believer and the unquestioned authority of God _ well, that's who I am,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> pastor who was defeated in June in his bid for presidency of the denomination. Baptist conservatives had mixed reactions to the organization. `` I affirm the right of Baptists to get together and discuss anything they want to discuss,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Vines </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, who is the denomination's president. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Pressler </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> judge who has been an architect of the conservative strategy, told the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> that he wishes dissenters would stop fighting. `` The Southern Baptist Convention needs healing and working together, not an escalation of political activity,'' he said. Many of the participants at last week's two-day meeting have been active in previous efforts to wrest control of the church from current leaders. Among its plans was to launch a new publication to provide news that does not appear in the convention's newsletter. The new organization is a coalition of regional groups including Message, a Texas-based group, and <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laity </ORGANIZATION> for the Baptist Faith.

<HEAD>Jewish Volunteers Work So Others Can Spend Christmas With Families</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Volunteers from Jewish groups have become part of a Christmas tradition in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> _ filling in for non-emergency workers at hospitals who otherwise might have to work on the holiday. The volunteer program started on a small scale in 1981 but has grown to a systemized effort involving about 500 volunteers who go to work on Christmas Day so that Christian workers may celebrate at home with their families. Members of the city's Jewish community launched the `` Pinch Hitter'' program when they saw that many people who wanted to be at home for the holiday had jobs that required them to work on Christmas. `` Christmas, obviously, holds little significance to the Jewish community, and here was a chance to let our Christian counterparts celebrate the holiday,'' said <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON>, associate publisher of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, a weekly newspaper which last year became a co-sponsor of the program. `` It's an opportunity to promote brotherhood and volunteerism in the same breath,'' <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> said. Started by the <LOCATION> Gate </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lodge </LOCATION> of B'nai B'rith, the Jewish fraternal organization, the program had about 50 volunteers participating the first couple of years. This year, organizers are expecting about 500 people to work at nine hospitals. The volunteers do just about any task required, <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> said, including janitorial work, kitchen duty and assisting in non-medical patient care. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, co-chairman of the program, said some hospital officials at first were surprised by the willingness of the volunteers to do menial tasks. `` They'd think in many cases we do n't want to get our hands dirty ... but that's what this game's all about,'' <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said. `` We're not replacing the doctors, we're replacing the minimum wage people. In addition to providing a break for some workers, the volunteers also help patients enjoy the holiday, said <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> Emory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>'s rehabilitation center, one of the facilities participating in the program. The volunteers have spent time with the center's patients, some of whom do not have family in the area and are alone for Christmas, Ms. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. `` It's a real important asset for our rehabilitation population,'' she said. As the program has grown, there has been an effort to make it better organized, <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> said. A committee this year is coordinating the needs of the hospitals with the available volunteers so that the facilities get the number of people they need. Another sign of the program's growth, <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said, is that a few non-Jews have joined as volunteers. `` Christmas can be a very lonely day for non-Jews who do n't have families,'' he said. `` We've had some call up and ask to volunteer.''

 The British government issued no public warnings about a threat made against <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> flights because the information was considered confidential, an official said Friday. The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> said British airports also were not told about the information passed on by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities. The threat mentioned a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> flight from <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, and did not specifically mention <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. Transport Minister <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Portillo </PERSON> said in a <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> television interview that the warning was not made public because `` this was confidential, classified, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence information and we did n't have the right to divulge it.'' The opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s transport spokesman, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Prescott </PERSON>, said the government's failure to publicize the threat ended in `` the poor, ignorant traveling public taking greater risk.'' <PERSON> Portillo </PERSON> said that `` many warnings are received over the course of a few months and if these are just fed out to the public without any assessment, then they would lose their impact.'' He told <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>: `` This particular warning was assessed. We looked very carefully at the procedures that we had in place for American airline flights. Those procedures are greater than for some other flights, and that was regarded as being appropriate.'' A New York-bound <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> jumbo jet that took off from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> crashed in southwest <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> on Wednesday, killing all aboard. Pan Am Flight 103 originated in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> with a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 and passengers and luggage were transferred to the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 at <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> said in a statement it `` did not receive any notification of a reported threat against a Pan American aircraft.'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s administration Friday ordered a security review at all British airports, a day after <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> Yard's anti-terrorism squad began an investigation at <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> into whether a bomb was smuggled into the plane. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday that an unidentified person telephoned the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, on Dec. 5 and said there would be a bombing attempt within two weeks against a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> aircraft flying from <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The caller claimed to belong to the <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> group, a radical Palestinian faction. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said it passed the threat to <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> and to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassies. <PERSON> Portillo </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities notified the government Dec. 9 of a bomb threat against U.S.-bound <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> jetliners arriving from <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> this month. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told reporters that to issue a public warning based on an anonymous threat would `` literally have closed down all the air traffic in the world.'' An unidentified British security source was quoted Friday by a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> newspaper, The Independent, as saying suspicion focused on pro-Iranian terrorists and that a claim of responsibility, from a caller saying he represented a group called the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution, was being taken `` very seriously.'' It quoted the source as saying the group was thought to have taken revenge for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> downing on July 3 of an Iranian airliner carrying 290 people over the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. An anonymous caller to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> claimed Thursday the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution was responsible. The source said the <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> group reportedly had been in contact with pro-Iranian groups before Wednesday night's crash. Government and industry officials said it seemed clear that the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> jet broke apart in flight, strewing blazing wreckage over the Scottish village of <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION> and surrounding hills. Such a sudden catastrophe would be consistent with reports by flight controllers that the cockpit sent no distress call as the plane, having reached cruising altitude of 31,000 feet, disappeared from radar.

 A propane tanker truck exploded on an interstate highway in downtown <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> today, spewing a 700-foot-wide fireball that killed at least five people and engulfed several homes and cars, authorities said. The explosion threw the tanker 125 yards onto a house, killing at least one child inside, said Fire Department Deputy Director <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>. Firefighters searched for a second child who was believed to be inside the home. At least a dozen people were injured, authorities said. `` There was a guy on fire rolling on the road and there was a another just lying on the ground where somebody must have put him. He was still smoking,'' said <PERSON> Jed </PERSON> <PERSON> Tennison </PERSON>, who runs a nearby business and witnessed the accident. The tanker skidded off an exit on Interstate 240 and exploded, unleashing a fireball that burned at least five houses on both sides of the highway and three or four other vehicles, said fire Capt. <PERSON> Benny </PERSON> <PERSON> McDow </PERSON>. `` He was trying to exit and lost control and hit a retaining wall,'' <PERSON> McDow </PERSON> said. `` That exit there is short. It's one of those tight turns.'' Four of the dead were killed on the highway, officials said. The identities of the dead and injured were not immediately known. Highway department ambulances took about a dozen people to area hospitals and other injured were transported by helicopter or by private vehicle, <PERSON> McDow </PERSON> said. The fire department was called about the explosion at 10:10 a.m, he said. `` We do not know the exact cause at this time,'' <PERSON> McDow </PERSON> said. `` Our original call came in as two houses exploded. We responded and found ... the interstate ... fire.''

 <LOCATION> PORT-AU-PRINCE </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ The expulsion of a radical slum priest from his ecclesiastic order has silenced <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s most influential voice for the rights of the nation's poor. In expelling the Rev. <PERSON> Jean-Bertrand </PERSON> <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON>, the conservative Salesian Order accused the populist Roman Catholic cleric of fomenting class warfare, calling him a `` protagonist of destabilization.'' His ouster was announced Dec. 15 in a statement from <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. Although <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON> remains a priest, he can not officiate at Mass or deliver sermons over church radio. `` He has been neutralized,'' said sociologist <PERSON> Franklyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Midi </PERSON>. <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON>, 35, a <LOCATION> Salesian </LOCATION> priest since 1975, has been one of the most outspoken campaigners for social justice in a country ruled for nearly its entire 184-year existence by dictators. He has escaped at least three attempts on his life, including a Sept. 11 attack at his <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bosco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in a <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION> slum in which thugs armed with machetes, guns, clubs and spears killed 12 people and wounded at least 70 others. One week later, rank-and-file soldiers overthrew Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> in a coup that put Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril in power. Coup leaders said they wanted democratic reforms and an end to state-sponsored violence, citing the church massacre as an example. Salesian officials expelled <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON> after he failed to obey their order to leave <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> by Oct. 17 and assume a new post in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. Two previous transfer orders were rescinded because of popular protests. Thousands protested in support of Aristide for several days in October, but there were no immediate demonstrations after the expulsion. <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON>, who has been seen in public only once since the church massacre, has made no public statement and has declined requests for interviews. But friends say his morale is excellent and he might appeal the church decision. Despite its condemnation of military brutality and human-rights abuses in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> hierarchy has long opposed <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON>'s political proselytizing of the poor A proponent of liberation theology, which advocates church involvement in a political struggle by the poor against social injustice, <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON> preaches `` active non-violence.'' He urges a `` real revolution'' to bring democracy to <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>, but does not specifically propose an armed uprising. His pulpit style is that of a fire-and-brimstone preacher whose leading questions prompt quick responses from the congregation. The sermons were broadcast nationwide and earned <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON> a huge following among the urban poor and the rural peasantry, who call the bespectacled ascetic their `` prophet.'' Although civic leaders and many priests applauded <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON>'s crusade, the church hierarchy apparently feared the possible consequences of radicalizing the masses `` The upper and middle classes, of course, have heaved a sigh of relief,'' <PERSON> Midi </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON>'s ouster. `` They are uncomfortable when the voice of the poor is raised too high.'' `` What they have not understood is that <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON> has contained the resentment of the impoverished masses by giving it a religious form,'' <PERSON> Midi </PERSON> added. `` He has not sent them into the streets but drawn them into the church.'' A Salesian spokesman in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, the Rev. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Aubrey </PERSON>, told the <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> that the expulsion was ordered because Haitian `` bishops worried about the results of <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON>'s action.'' But the Rev. <PERSON> Serge </PERSON> <PERSON> Miot </PERSON>, secretary of <ORGANIZATION> Haitian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bishops </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, denied that the council had asked the Salesians to expel <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON>. The effective silencing of Aristide coincides with a move by <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> to tighten army discipline after a purported Oct. 14 coup attempt. Since then, the government has imprisoned or discharged dozens of soldiers for alleged insubordination. Leftist politicians have accused the government of clamping down on the most progressive element in the army _ soldiers angered by the slow progress in bringing about the democratic reforms <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> promised when he became president. It is not known what role, if any, the government had in <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON>'s ouster; but to some, the priest has become a symbol of the democratic struggle. `` <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON> was discharged from his religious order in the same way that soldiers faithful to the Sept. 17 reform movement have been discharged from the army,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Dejean </PERSON>, a Haitian author and social worker, referring to those who participated in the coup to gain democratic reforms. `` People who believe in the Gospel values of liberation, liberty, and justice are penalized and punished,'' he said.

<HEAD>Army Grounds Chinooks for Transmission Checks</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> said Friday it has grounded its 234 CH-47D medium-lift Chinook helicopters to allow inspection of possibly faulty transmissions. Ten Chinooks have been involved in accidents since 1985, and 16 soldiers were killed in incidents involving the helicopter this year, although there is no indication that faulty transmissions were the cause, said <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Paige </PERSON> <PERSON> Eversole </PERSON>. The Army grounded the copter fleet in what it called a `` precautionary action'' after the manufacturer, the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, discovered that `` certain transmissions may have been improperly assembled,'' the announcement said. In the most recent Chinook accident, five servicemen were killed in a crash in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> on Dec. 8. Last Feb. 25, 11 soldiers were killed in a Chinook crash near <LOCATION> Chico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Army officials are still investigating the Dec. 8 incident, but there is `` no suspicion'' that it was linked to the possible transmission problem, Ms. <PERSON> Eversole </PERSON> said. `` Right now we are not speculating at all on the cause of that accident. We do n't know whether there is a relationship between that accident and this problem. The Army is very quick to ground the fleet ... for preventive care,'' she said. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> is sending inspection teams to look at the retainer bolt assembly, which provides for the proper alignment of internal gearing and bearings within the main transmission, the spokeswoman said. The inspections will require 30 days, according to the announcement. The first Chinook CH-47D entered Army service in 1979, replacing older CH-47 models. The Army is gradually replacing the remaining 146 older Chinooks with the `` D'' model, which has more powerful engines and transmissions, fiberglass rotor blades, and advanced flight control systems, the announcement said. The Chinook can carry a payload of 16,000 pounds or ferry 33 soldiers. The helicopter that crashed in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> was on a routine mission connected with maneuvers the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> has been conducting in that Central American country since 1982. In the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> crash, `` the retainer bolt assembly was not identified as a possible cause,'' Ms. <PERSON> Eversole </PERSON> said. Despite the recent crashes involving the Chinook, the fiscal year thaty ended Sept. 30 `` was the safest year on record, with 1.8 accidents per 100,000 hours of flying time for all Army aviation,'' she said.

<HEAD>USDA Setting Sanitary Standards for Air Shipment of Animals</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A new federal sanitation regulation is being expanded to include airplanes used to carry animals sold to foreign buyers, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Glosser </PERSON>, administrator of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inspection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said the new rule will take effect on Jan. 23. It was officially proposed two years ago. Until now, he said, sanitation rules covered only ships, which were the principal carriers of animals exported by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The regulations will not apply to the shipment of pets and other small animals. `` Today, most animals, like people, travel abroad by air, and air travel should be addressed by the regulations,'' <PERSON> Glosser </PERSON> said. `` In fact, most airplanes already are disinfected before they are used to transport animals from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' Vehicles used for animals can be contaminated with disease organisms or flies, ticks, lice and mites that carry disease, he said. The expanded rule covers aircraft, loading ramps, fittings and other equipment. All will have to be cleaned and disinfected before animals are loaded, <PERSON> Glosser </PERSON> said.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> offered condolences today to families of the victims of the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> crash in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> but said to issue a public warning based on an anonymous threat would `` literally have closed down all the air traffic in the world.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> made the comment in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> before arriving here for a two-week <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> holiday vacation. The president said it would be impossible to issue public warnings about all such supposed terrorist threats. `` If you stop to think about it, such a public statement, with nothing but a telephone call to go on, would literally have closed down all the air traffic in the world,'' said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` The search still goes on. We have no knowledge about how the accident happened. We're still trying to find out,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said of investigation into the crash on the New York-bound flight Wednesday in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> that killed at least 280 people. Asked about warnings issued to some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats of a threat of terrorist attack against a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> flight from <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, he said, `` All the precautions that could be taken were taken with regard to warning the airline and all.'' He was referring to warnings by the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> and police authorities, but not to the general public. <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, said Thursday that an unidentified individual telephoned the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> on Dec. 5 and said there would be a bombing attempt within two weeks against a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> aircraft flying from <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Flight 103 originated in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> with a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727, with passengers and luggage switched to a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. Asked if he had any knowledge about whether a bomb had caused the plane to explode, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, `` None of this is established.'' Prior to answering questions, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> read a statement, with his wife <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> at his side. `` I want to express our sorrow and concern to the families and friends of those who died in the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> crash ... There are difficult aspects of this tragedy, but none so compelling as the anguish of those families who will not have their loved ones with them this Christmas season,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, noting that several dozen students from <ORGANIZATION> Syracuse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> lost their lives in the fiery crash, young people who `` carried the twin promises of hopes and dreams.'' `` The tragedy that steals the hopes and dreams from our society magnifies the loss to our society,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. The president asked the nation to `` say a special prayer this Christmas'' for the victims of the crash and their loved ones. The president and his wife then departed on their Marine One helicopter for Andrews Air Force Base. They planned to celebrate Christmas in their lush new Bel Air home and bring in the New Year at the palatial estate of multimillionaire publisher <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Annenberg </PERSON> in Rancho Mirage, near <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>. The president, who has spent 444 days in his home state since taking office in January, 1981, will return to the White House Jan. 5. After he leaves office Jan. 20, he and the first lady will move to <ORGANIZATION> Bel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>. The $ 2.5 million estate was purchased by <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> friends of the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION>, who are leasing it to them. In an interview broadcast Thursday night, veteran <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> television journalist <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkley </PERSON> noted that some homeless sleep on grates or on the grass in <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, across <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Avenue from the White House. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> replied, `` Yes, but, <PERSON> David </PERSON>, does n't that go back _ that there are always going to be people _ they make it their own choice for staying out there.'' `` There are shelters in virtually every city and shelters here and those people still prefer out there on the grates or the lawn to going into one of those shelters,'' the president said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also said that `` a large percentage'' of the homeless are retarded people freed from institutions after laws were changed so that `` they could only be committed to an asylum or a mental hospital if they represented a threat, a danger to others or to themselves.'' `` People particularly in _ you call it retarded _ walked away from those institutions, they wanted freedom, but they walked out to where there was nothing for them,'' he said. In the interview, taped Wednesday in the Oval Office, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also commented on whether he thought Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, whom he has joined in forging more cordial U.S.-Soviet relations, might be forced from office. `` Up until now the government of that huge country or nation is the <ORGANIZATION> communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION>, which is really a tiny elite of the population of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` But they literally appoint, so it is possible for _ and we've seen it in the past _ Soviet leaders to suddenly be ousted I do n't see any indication yet or threat of that, but I think it's something that has to be considered if you look at their past history. When asked whether he thought he had escaped blame for things that went wrong in his administration because people liked him, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said that `` maybe that's in return for something, because I like people. I really do.''

 The decomposed body of a toddler was found stuffed in a gym bag, the bag in a suitcase encased in concrete and dumped along a dirt road, police said Friday. An autopsy Thursday night was only partially conclusive, and police do not know who the child is. Ware County Sheriff <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> said there are no small children known to be missing from the area. The body was found Wednesday by a trucker, 16 miles west of <LOCATION> Waycross </LOCATION>. She had been wrapped in a blanket and stuffed in a gym bag, which then was placed in a metal suitcase, and the suitcase sealed with concrete. The suitcase was then placed in an abandoned TV console and nailed shut with plywood. The driver, who was not identified, `` cried like a baby when he found it,'' the sheriff said. The autopsy at the State Crime Lab determined her sex, race and probable age. <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> said pathologists determined that the child had been dead about one to two months and was about 3, who was 2-feet-9 and weighed about 30 pounds. `` They were able to tell us she had not been shot or stabbed,'' <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> said Friday. `` I do n't know whether it was an abused child that was accidentally killed, or a kidnap victim that was killed somewhere else and brought there,'' he said. `` But somebody went to great extremes to put it together and then leave it out there in the open.''

<HEAD>Soviets Scrap Six Nuclear Plants</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Six nuclear power projects have been halted in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> because of earthquake danger or tougher standards imposed after the Chernobyl accident, the nuclear power minister said Friday. Official media has reported cancellation of several projects because of growing public opposition after the Chernobyl disaster. But the list provided at a news conference by <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukonin </PERSON>, minister of the nuclear power industry, was the first comprehensive report on the state of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> nuclear power industry. Cancellations were `` partly due to highly seismic areas, and the second reason were changes in regulations and norms of building power plants,'' <PERSON> Lukonin </PERSON> said. He said projects had been scrapped in <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Minsk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Byelorussia </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Odessa </LOCATION>; and <LOCATION> Krasnodar </LOCATION>; and that additional units to existing plants in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> had been canceled. Those projects had a combined capacity of 28 million kilowatt hours. Officials also temporarily suspended work on a third reactor in the Baltic republic of <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> because of public concern about possible environmental damage to a lake and earthquake danger, <PERSON> Lukonin </PERSON> said. The nuclear plant located near the Armenian capital of <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> is built on a geological fault. It was shaken but undamaged by the Dec. 7 quake that killed an estimated 55,000 people in northern <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. But Premier <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> on Dec. 12 that the plant will be closed in two years because of the danger of future quakes. The <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Krasnodar </LOCATION> sites also are located near <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> in the earthquake-prone <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> region of the southern <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has 16 nuclear power plants containing 45 reactors that now produce 12.7 percent of the country's electricity. Officials are looking for new sites in more stable areas such as <LOCATION> Karelia </LOCATION> in the far north near <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Lukonin </PERSON> said. Despite the cancellations, planning and construction is continuing at 15 other sites, and it is `` impossible'' to develop the Soviet economy without further reliance on nuclear power, <PERSON> Lukonin </PERSON> said. Soviet officials have acknowledged a fear of nuclear power among citizens since the April 1986 Chernobyl accident in the northern <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION> that killed at least 31 people and released a cloud of radiation that eventually circled the globe. Opposition to nuclear power has brought Soviets out on the streets of several cities and some residents of <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION> are inclined to blame unexplained health problems on the Chernobyl accident. <PERSON> Lukonin </PERSON> said fears of nuclear power were a major reason officials imposed stricter siting and construction requirements after the Chernobyl accident. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> ended production of the graphite-cooled reactor of the type that failed at <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION>. But 15 of those reactors still are operating with modifications made after <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION>. `` We have to work more closely with the public. We have had certain misunderstandings with that in the past,'' <PERSON> Lukonin </PERSON> said. `` We have less problems when we explain.'' Officials of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atomic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, which conducted the first international inspection of a <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> nuclear power plant, said they were impressed with its safety features and staff, but that manufacturers had supplied poor quality equipment that needed modification before it was used. `` What the team saw in some cases is that the plant had to take some equipment that was received, and on plant initiative improve the quality,'' said <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON>, the director of the agency's nuclear safety program The director of the Ukrainian plant that underwent the inspection said he had spent $ 260 million to improve equipment. V.A. <PERSON> Korovkin </PERSON>, director of the plant in the western <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Rovno </LOCATION>, said the equipment was for two older reactors, a third reactor commissioned during the past two years and a fourth unit that is under construction. Agency officials said there was no way to tell from the recently completed three-week inspection of the <LOCATION> Rovno </LOCATION> plant whether similar quality problems exist at other Soviet plants. Next year they will carry out a similar inspection in <LOCATION> Gorky </LOCATION>, located east of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>.

 A former <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> student who went on a Halloween lock-gluing spree has been placed on probation for five years and has agreed to pay $ 9,800 for damage to seven buildings and telephone cables. <PERSON> Kamal </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyder </PERSON>, 23, from <PERSON> Ryadh </PERSON>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, was among three students charged with causing nearly $ 16,000 worth of damage by injecting a liquid-steel substance into the building locks on Halloween 1987. <ORGANIZATION> Hyder </ORGANIZATION> also was accused of cutting telephone cables and other vandalism. His attorney, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Hyder </PERSON>, who did not graduate, is employed by an engineering firm in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and is working on several significant projects including a computer for the blind that can read any style of type. `` This case aside, I have been doing constructive things,'' <ORGANIZATION> Hyder </ORGANIZATION> told <ORGANIZATION> Northampton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Clement </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferris </PERSON>. He said he had received a British award for academic achievement and played his sitar in charity concerts. `` I've written 200 letters of apology to <ORGANIZATION> UMass </ORGANIZATION> professors and apologized in person to people for what happened,'' he said. <PERSON> Hyder </PERSON> told the judge he had learned about gluing locks from a co-defendant but had come up with his own more efficient way of doing it. `` I do n't see any gain by saddling this man with a record,'' <PERSON> Ferris </PERSON> said in agreeing to continue the charges without a finding for five years. `` Like anybody else, he's entitled to have made a dumb mistake.'' Charges against a co-defendant, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Milbier </PERSON>, also were continued without a finding when <PERSON> Milbier </PERSON> agreed to pay $ 9,800 in restitution. Charges against the third student, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, were dismissed after <PERSON> Ferris </PERSON> found that <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, who was supposed to act as a lookout for the other two while the locks were glued, had second thoughts and fled.

<HEAD>Loose Fuel Cap Reportedly Caused F-A-18 Crash, Four Other Mishaps</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 One <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> F-A-18 Hornet fighter has crashed and four others have experienced in-flight problems due to a loose fuel filler cap, according to a report published Friday. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> quoted documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act involving a non-fatal crash of an F-A-18 near <LOCATION> Twentynine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palms </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, on Feb. 7, 1987. `` There have been four previous F-A-18A fires or potential fires resulting from fuel caps being improperly locked to the centerline tank or due to some other suspected malfunction of the fuel cap,'' according to a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> accident report quoted by <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON>, confirmed that an improperly tightened fuel filler cap caused one crash of an F-A-18 Hornet, but he had not seen documents discussing the other four incidents. `` We have not detected an inherent design flaw with that fuel filler cap that would cause us to ground the aircraft or to redsign the fuel filler cap,'' <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON> said. `` We know of one case where a maintenance air crewman improperly secured the fuel filler cap prior to the aircraft taking off,'' <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON> said. `` The cap was ingested by one of the engines and, as you may suspect, wiped out the engine and caused the aircraft to crash.'' `` The investigation into that crash showed that the maintenance crew of the Ff Wall Street, the nation's fifth-largest securities firm elected not to risk getting its head blown off. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> decided to settle the biggest securities fraud case in history by paying a record $ 650 million in fines and restitution and pleading guilty to six felonies, reversing its longstanding claims of innocence. The battle had already cost the firm nearly $ 2 billion in attorneys' fees and lost business. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> also agreed to cooperate with <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>'s expanding probes into financial trading abuses spawned largely by the downfall of <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, the convicted speculator who fingered <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> and others more than two years ago. The decision came moments before a deadline set by <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> to <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> following weeks of bluffs, counter-bluffs and leaks to the newspapers that a climax was imminent. Post-mortem accounts of this historic showdown reveal <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s directors he was going to make an announcement at 4 p.m. Wednesday. `` He said, ` It's going to be either an indictment or a settlement. You decide,''' said one source familiar with the final pre-deadline maneuvering, who requested anonymity. `` It was a game of blink, and <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> blinked.'' The biggest weapon in <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>'s arsenal was his threat to subject <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> to the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations act, commonly known as RICO, a widely feared, far-reaching statute originally designed to combat drug runners, gangsters and pimps. If <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> had been indicted under that act, the government could have frozen much of its assets and seized what prosecutors had reason to believe were the firm's ill-gotten gains, before trial, to hold as security. Individuals named in the indictment would have been forced to surrender their earnings during the period of alleged wrongdoing. A trial could have taken months or even years, diverting time, energy and money from a firm that has prided itself on efficiency, aggressiveness and big profits. Moreover, convictions would have exposed <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> to multiple civil lawsuits that could have resulted in many hundreds of millions of dollars in fines, because of the racketeering act's provision for triple damages to victims. A racketeering indictment would have come at the worst possible time for <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>, which has been playing crucial financing roles in nearly every multibillion-dollar takeover of the year, most notably a $ 5 billion bridge loan for <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 24.5 billion acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> executives were known to be anxious to protect their interest in that deal, which could net as much as $ 300 million in fees Only a few weeks before <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> deadline, the prosecutor had demonstrated vividly to the firm just how powerful the racketeering act can be. The small <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> investment partnership <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> liquidated because five of its principals and a former <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> trader had been indicted under the statute in August by a Giuliani-directed grand jury. The majority of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s directors decided not to risk a similar fate and opted instead for a settlement that would label the firm a felon but at least put the investigation behind it for good. In other economic and business news this past week: _ British conglomerate <ORGANIZATION> Grand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> acquired <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 5.68 billion, ending the Minneapolis-based food and restaurant concern's feeble effort to thwart the takeover, largely by relying on its poison-pill shareholder rights defense Grand Met's triumph raised new questions about the effectiveness of poison pills, which have been repeatedly challenged in court. _ Government figures presented more mixed evidence of the economy's health Inflation eased slightly in November, while consumer spending and orders for large durable goods rose. For the third quarter of the year, the broadest measure of economic growth was 2.5 percent, down slightly from an earlier estimate of 2.6 percent. None of the figures pointed decisively to a slowdown or an overheated economy. But there was speculation that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> would move soon to hike interest rates if it viewed inflation as a threat. _ The Big Three automakers said vehicle sales jumped 15.3 percent during the mid-December period, paced by a 35.9 percent leap in <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> car sales The performance reflected a major improvement over the same time a year earlier, when consumers spooked by the October 1987 stock market crash cut back on spending for expensive items.

 Rep. <PERSON> Bud </PERSON> <PERSON> Shuster </PERSON> says it was a `` legitimate public works project'' that led him to the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> last week. But congressional sources said things seemed to happen in the reverse order _ that the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Republican wanted to go the islands, and dispatched aides to find a reason for the government to send him there. <PERSON> Shuster </PERSON> toured an airport construction project before leaving St. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> island on Wednesday following a four-day stay. <PERSON> Shuster </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, had his trip to the island of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Thomas </LOCATION> approved `` without compunctions'' by Rep. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>., the panel's chairman, according to committee aide <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlesinger </PERSON> The airport tour came after Public Works staff members had looked into other projects for <PERSON> Shuster </PERSON> to inspect in the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, including one on <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Croix </LOCATION>, according to congressional aides who spoke on condition of anonymity. While he was in the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Shuster </PERSON>'s top aides refused to disclose his whereabouts. `` We're going to take this back to the voters. He did nothing wrong,'' <PERSON> Shuster </PERSON> administrative assistant <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Eppard </PERSON> said Friday. She said the congressman knew nothing about staff members shopping around for projects, and that if they did that, `` then it was not initiated by the congressman.'' She said <PERSON> Shuster </PERSON> was unavailable for an comment Friday. Interviewed by telephone Thursday from his rural central <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> district, <PERSON> Shuster </PERSON> denied that the committee was paying for the entire trip. He said the tour of the airport `` was an official trip, and the committee pays for my airfare back. I spent my own money staying.'' <PERSON> Shuster </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> trip represented `` a couple days off'' and that, `` It's none of your goddamned business what I do in my personal time.'' <PERSON> Schlesinger </PERSON>, the committee aide, said he was not aware that <PERSON> Shuster </PERSON> had arranged to pay part of the cost. But <PERSON> Eppard </PERSON> said <PERSON> Shuster </PERSON> got only `` a one-day per diem and a one-way -LRB- plane -RRB- ticket.'' Like other committees, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel is free to sponsor its members on fact-finding missions around the world. <PERSON> Shuster </PERSON> tacked the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> trip onto the end of a fact-finding trip to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> that he had taken with three other <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members of the <ORGANIZATION> Permanent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Shuster </PERSON> said he arrived in the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> on Dec. 17, the day after the intelligence committee concluded its fact-finding mission. Asked why <PERSON> Shuster </PERSON> did not return home with the others, Rep. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Livingston </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-La </LOCATION>., said, `` He had other business to tend to. <PERSON> Shuster </PERSON>, the second-ranking Republican on the Public Works panel and a member of the subcommittee on aviation, inspected the Cyril E. King Airport in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Thomas </LOCATION> on the same day as his trip home, according to officials of the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Authority </LOCATION>. `` This is construction of a completely new airport on an existing airport. A lot of money has been appropriated for this project and he wanted to understand what was being done and how far it had progressed,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Harding </PERSON>, executive director of the port authority. <PERSON> Shuster </PERSON> termed it `` a legitimate public works inspection.'' He said there has been a major cost overrun, and the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> had cited the airport `` as being among the most dangerous.'' <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Joann </PERSON> <PERSON> Sloane </PERSON> said in an interview Friday, `` From what I can find out, it's not dangerous but they have a short runway. There's a mountain on one side and water and other, and they're building the new runway out into where the water is.'' <PERSON> Shuster </PERSON> said aides did not disclose his trip because there was a rule in his office not to reveal his itinerary for security reasons. Asked about <PERSON> Shuster </PERSON>'s whereabouts earlier this week while he was in the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, aide <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Schecter </PERSON> had pointed to a wire service photograph appearing in a <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> newspaper on Dec. 15 _ six days earlier _ showing the congressman in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. The conservative <PERSON> Shuster </PERSON>, 56, was just elected to his ninth term. In September, he was presented with his tenth Golden Bulldog Award by a private, non-partisan group which presents awards for fiscal integrity.

 <PERSON> Ingrid </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> cut short a visit home to be with her husband in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, and got a last-minute seat on Pan Am Flight 103 because her husband was a pilot _ with <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>. `` The last we heard from <PERSON> Ingrid </PERSON> was when she rang from <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> and said ` Mum I have got on,''' said her mother, <PERSON> Hilda </PERSON> <PERSON> Ledgard </PERSON> of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hykeham </LOCATION> in central <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. `` We are devastated.'' Like others rushing to be with family for the holidays or changing their plans, the last-minute booking cost Mrs. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> her life. The jumbo jet en route to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> broke up at 31,000 feet Wednesday night over <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, killing all aboard. Mrs. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, whose husband, <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON>, had previously captained the same <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> jet which crashed, had been visiting her parents when she changed her plans. She at first wanted to stay because her mother was ill, but then learned her husband was to be working over Christmas in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. With her parents' blessing, she went to <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> hoping to get on a flight. <PERSON> Flora </PERSON> <PERSON> Swire </PERSON>, a medical student, and <PERSON> Yvonne </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>, a social worker, also wound up on Flight 103 by chance. A graduate in medicine from <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, Ms. <PERSON> Swire </PERSON> was traveling to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> to spend Christmas and New Year with her boyfriend, a doctor. She was studying for a doctorate at <ORGANIZATION> Nottingham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` She went down to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> on Monday and bought a stand-by ticket for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Tuesday,'' her mother, <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Swire </PERSON>, said from her home in <LOCATION> Bromsgrove </LOCATION>, in eastern <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. `` She was waved off from <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> by her younger sister, <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON>, before boarding the flight,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Swire </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Yvonne </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> changed her plans to be with her boyfriend in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and his sick sister. The 29-year-old from <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION> had planned to take her 18-month-old daughter, <PERSON> Bryony </PERSON>, to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> for the holidays, but decided instead that she and <PERSON> Bryony </PERSON> would visit her boyfriend to help him take care of his sister. The <PERSON> Stevenson </PERSON> family heading for Christmas holidays in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> also died in the crash, which left more than 20 people on the ground in and around the Scottish village of <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION> missing and presumed dead. <PERSON> John </PERSON> and <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevenson </PERSON> and their daughters <PERSON> Hannah </PERSON>, 10, and <PERSON> Rachel </PERSON>, 8, were to spend Christmas with relatives. `` We are all very shocked,'' said <PERSON> Fiona </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON>, who worked with <PERSON> Stevenson </PERSON> at the regional office for the credit card company, <ORGANIZATION> Visa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>. `` He was a very popular, very effective member of the staff.''

<TEXT>
 The federal government has canceled an effort to rescue a bottlenose dolphin from <LOCATION> Broad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, but the head of the rescue operation said Friday he remains worried the mammal will die in the cold. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Schoelkopf </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mammal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stranding </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Brigantine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> called off the rescue effort because the dolphin is not sick. `` The animal is considered not to be a stranding. It's healthy and swimming,'' he said by telephone. The 6-foot-long dolphin known as `` Rascal'' led a rescue team on a chase around the bay for two days as divers tried to net it to move it to warm water. More than 50 volunteers and a dozen boats participated in the operation that ended Thursday. Although the dolphin seemed robust, <PERSON> Schoelkopf </PERSON> said he is concerned it will weaken as the water temperature dips below 42 degrees. <PERSON> Schoelkopf </PERSON> also said the dolphin may not find enough to eat. But <PERSON> Schoelkopf </PERSON> said he would take no more action unless invited to do so by the federal government, which has authority over rescue attempts.

 Robbers preying on <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> immigrants have held up at least a dozen people in the last week, and police and community leaders are warning Asians to be careful and not carry a lot of money. In one robbery, a Hmong woman lost a purse containing $ 5,500. `` The word is out that they carry money,'' police Capt. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. `` The facts speak for themselves,'' said <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> police spokesman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Adlemann </PERSON>. `` These people are definitely being targeted.'' Two men arrested in the holdup Wednesday of two Hmong women in north <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> have been linked by photographs and a stolen car to at least one earlier robbery, in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION>. But hours after the two were captured with the help of a Hmong man armed with a shotgun, police said another <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> man was robbed in north <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>. Leaders of the area's Southeast Asian community have begun holding meetings with heads of clans and families, warning them of the hazards of carrying money and urging them to use banks. <PERSON> Ying </PERSON> <PERSON> Vang </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Lao </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION>, said the group contacted 60 Hmong leaders and asked that they call emergency meetings to discuss taking extra precautions. `` We told them to make sure people are aware of this rash of robberies and to watch each other closely and make sure more do not happen,'' he said. Southeast Asians living in some public housing projects also have formed groups to patrol at night, he said. <PERSON> Vang </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheng </PERSON> <PERSON> Nengchu </PERSON>, a Hmong social worker, said, `` I think that not everybody in the community is aware of the -LRB- recent robberies -RRB- yet because of language obstacles.'' <PERSON> Ying </PERSON> <PERSON> Vang </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hmong </PERSON> leaders were asked to encourage members of the 15,000-person community, one of the nation's largest concentrations of <LOCATION> Hmong </LOCATION>, to use banks. He estimated that 20 to 30 percent do not because of language barriers and unfamiliarity with banking systems. Detectives in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> and <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, meanwhile, are investigating possible links among the dozen robberies, and say there may be more they do n't know of. Word of the robbers' success has spread, they say, through news accounts and word of mouth on the street. `` We know there's more going on out there, and the Hmong community should know that they're more vulnerable by virtue of a few successful robberies,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said.

 Authorities say they believe a death row inmate who says he killed a reporter but do not plan to prosecute him. `` The various statements he made in his confession convinced us he is in fact the responsible party,'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dakopolos </PERSON>, an assistant <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> prosecutor. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> LaRette </PERSON>, 37, of <LOCATION> Topeka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, said in a statement that he killed <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> <PERSON> Wortmann </PERSON>, a reporter for the <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sentinel-Tribune </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Blue </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, in 1977.

 A short but dense bank of fog was blamed for a pileup of at least 28 cars that killed one holiday traveler and injured 20 other people Friday morning, officials said. `` I was driving and the next minute, there it is,'' said <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, whose car was near the front of the mass of smashed vehicles. He received minor injuries. <PERSON> Dana </PERSON> <PERSON> Knapp </PERSON>, 25, of <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, was killed and her husband, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>, 27, was injured, said <PERSON> Debe </PERSON> <PERSON> West </PERSON>, spokeskwoman at <ORGANIZATION> Cookeville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Ms. </PERSON> <PERSON> West </PERSON> said the 20 injured people _ including <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Knapp </PERSON> _ were all treated and released. `` We put some on a bus. One couple we sent by limousine service to <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> for a rental car,'' she said. `` Others have contacted family members.'' The accident occurred at 8:30 a.m. on Interstate 40, about four miles west of <LOCATION> Cookeville </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> Lt. <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>. <PERSON> Anita </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilborn </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Blackstone </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, was in the third car in the pileup. She watched the accident start. `` This tan colored car, as soon as we hit the bank of fog, it panicked and ran right in front of a navy colored van,'' she said. `` That van slammed on his brakes and hit the car. From then we started braking and hitting each other in the rear end.'' <PERSON> Black </PERSON> said it was unlikely that charges would be filed because the fog made an accident almost unavoidable. `` They could n't see anything,'' he said. He said at least 28 cars were involved, but several were not counted because they were only slightly damaged and drove away with the permission of the first troopers on the scene. <PERSON> Black </PERSON> said the fog bank, about 500 feet long, cleared about an hour after the accident.

 The <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> family is spending Christmas at a friend's townhouse while their home is repaired, and they are rebuilding their lives as well after losing their daughter last month in a spate of deadly tornadoes. `` We talk about it constantly,'' <PERSON> Libby </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> said of the twisters that ripped through their community Nov. 28, killing their daughter, <PERSON> Janet </PERSON>, 9, and three other people. `` We laugh at things she did, we talk about things she did that we wish she had n't done.'' <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> was a vivacious third-grader whose fate her parents, <PERSON> Walt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Libby </PERSON>, brother <PERSON> Chip </PERSON>, 19, and sister <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>, 16, are struggling to accept. `` I'm just finding the whole concept of it kind of hard to grasp,'' <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> said as she and her family discussed their ordeal Wednesday night.

A few days after <PERSON> Janet </PERSON>'s funeral, <PERSON> Walt </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> spoke at a support gathering at a nearby elementary school. `` The point I tried to make is that the weather has been around this planet four and a half billion years, and we have been here a relatively short time,'' <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> said. `` And sometimes we get in the way of the weather or the elements or the environment. It's not something that's sent upon us. We wanted very much for the children to understand that.''

<HEAD>Parliament Passes Key Laws on Economy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The parliament on Friday approved bills to encourge private ownership and foreign investment in an attempt to reverse four decades of state economic control. The Communist government pushed the two pieces of legislation, which become law Jan. 1, to radically alter the structure of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s socialist economy. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s 460-member Sejm, or parliament, unanimously approved the new Law on Economic Activity, which eliminates limits on the size of businesses that can be privately owned. There were two abstentions. The foreign investment bill drew two `` no'' votes and six abstentions, the official <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported. Private business now accounts for about 6 percent of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s non-farm economy, but Industry Minister <PERSON> Mieczyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilczek </PERSON> _ calling the bills' passage a `` historic breakthrough'' _ has said he hopes thousands of new businesses will open next year The new law on economic activity removes past discrimination against private ownership, treating state-owned, cooperative and private businesses the same for legal purposes. Private businesses previously were limited in size to 50 employees and needed permission from administrative officials to operate. Businesses could be turned down if a local official deemed them unneeded or said they interfered with an existing state or cooperative monopoly. But the new law removes any ceiling on the size of the work force and allows individuals, cooperatives, partnerships and limited liability companies to start and operate businesses as long as they comply with safety, environmental and fire protection laws. However, 11 areas of activity _ such as weapons manufacture, production and sales of pharmaceuticals and alcohol or operation of sea and air transport _ will require prior government licenses because they involve public safety. Firms are freed from the previous obligation to associate with industrial or professional groups. Despite the government's high hopes for the legislation, there were some doubts. `` To ... be able to invest in something, one has to have something to invest,'' said an article Sunday in the weekly magazine <ORGANIZATION> Wprost </ORGANIZATION>. `` The majority of Polish families spend their earnings on current consumption and can not afford'' to start businesses. Only `` richer citizens have now gained an opportunity to show what they can do,'' the article concludes. The law on foreign investment combines and replaces two old laws, one for investment by foreigners of Polish descent and one for everyone else. In both cases the rules are now easier. A foreign investor must put up at least 20 percent of the start-up cost of any business or joint venture, and the business will be subject to a 40 percent income tax _ lower if the company produces for export. Unlike previous laws, there are no requirements that majority control and local management be Polish. Companies will have access to currency auctions where they can convert profits earned in zlotys to hard currency at market rates. They also will be allowed to sell to Poles in hard currency. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> passed a foreign-investment bill in 1986 but businesses considered its terms so unattractive that only about a dozen companies took advantage of it. Authorities hope that <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s low wage scale and skilled work force will attract manufacturing and service facilities to serve other European countries. The deputy prime minister, <PERSON> Ireneusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Sekula </PERSON>, presented the legislation to parliament Thursday, saying the laws would become the basis `` for freedom, equality and competition in the economy.'' Departing from orthodox communist assumptions of an equal share in the wealth for all citizens, he defined the state's duty only as creating `` equal opportunity.'' `` Further possibilities should depend on -LRB- people's -RRB- individual achievements,'' he said. `` This is the only way one should understand justice.'' Parliamentarian <PERSON> Lucien </PERSON> <PERSON> Stepien </PERSON> said that in the context of decades of `` Stalinist governing'' the new laws might seem `` revolutionary.'' But in reality, he said, `` they are just an attempt to get back to normal.''

They hope to return the 2-year-old mammal to the Gulf in January. Sea World research biologist <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Odell </PERSON> says he knows of no other case in which a Bryde's whale survived a stranding and was returned to natural habitat. `` We got lucky,'' he said, watching the two-ton mammal floating in a pool at the marine attraction Thursday. A boater discovered the whale Nov. 25 in shallow water off <LOCATION> Honeymoon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Clearwater </LOCATION>. During a daylong rescue it was towed to shore, hoisted by crane into a truck and transported to <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> <LOCATION> World </LOCATION>, 100 miles east. <PERSON> Bryde </PERSON>'s whales, which grow to 40 feet, are usually found in water more than 100 feet deep. Scientists do n't know why the whale beached. Blood tests showed a generalized infection which is responding to antibiotics. And with huge doses of vitamins and 105,000 calories daily in herring gruel and high-calorie liquids, the whale has steadily improved. At <ORGANIZATION> Sea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION>, the whale is hoisted out of the pool and tube fed, a process that takes about 20 minutes. While it is being tube fed, workers coat its back with a zinc oxide to prevent sunburn and dress cuts. Experts are uncertain whether the whale will resume normal feeding patterns once returned to the sea. They hope to transport it 75 miles out and attach a radio transmitter to track it.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Friday mourned the victims of the crash of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 and insisted it would have been an `` impossible thing to do'' to warn the American public about all threats against commercial airliners. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and his wife <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> then flew across the country for a holiday stay at his soon-to-be retirement home in an exclusive <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> neighborhood after the president made his remarks in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The president, leaving the White House for his two-week <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> vacation, also asked Americans to `` say a special prayer'' this Christmas for the families and friends of those aboard the plane and those killed on the ground at <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, on Wednesday. Some 280 people perished. `` I want to express our sorrow and concern to the families and friends of those who died in the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> crash ... There are difficult aspects of this tragedy, but none so compelling as the anguish of those families who will not have their loved ones with them this Christmas season,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said as his wife stood beside him in the rain in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The president noted that some three dozen students from <ORGANIZATION> Syracuse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> lost their lives in the fiery crash, calling them young people who `` carried the twin promises of hopes and dreams.'' `` The tragedy that steals the hopes and dreams from our society magnifies the loss to our society,'' he said. A reporter asked <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> whether all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens, and not just diplomats, should have been warned about a Dec. 5 telephoned threat of terrorist attack against a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> flight from <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>. `` All the precautions that could be taken were taken with regard to warning the airline and all,'' he replied. Of a possible public warning, the president added, `` I think that would have been a virtually impossible thing to do on the basis of that telephone call.'' `` If you stop to think about it, such a public statement, with nothing but a telephone call to go on, would literally have closed down all the air traffic in the world,'' he said. Asked whether he had any new information as to whether the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> jumbo jet was the target of a terrorist bomb, he replied, `` None of this is established. The search still goes on. We have no knowledge about how the accident happened. We're still trying to find out.'' <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, said Thursday that an unidentified person telephoned the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> on Dec. 5 and said there would be a bombing attempt within two weeks against a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> aircraft flying from <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Flight 103 originated in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> with a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727, with passengers and luggage switched to a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> for continuation of the trip to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> flew to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> aboard Air Force One to celebrate Christmas in their new home in the posh <ORGANIZATION> Bel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> section of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and bring in the New Year at the estate of multimillionaire publisher <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Annenberg </PERSON> in Rancho Mirage, near <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> took the president on a tour of the home after a motorcade from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. He exclaimed, `` I am awed and I love it,'' according to assistant White House press secretary <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberg </PERSON>. It was <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s second visit to the house, according to the first lady. She has said she sneaked him out of their hotel on a previous trip to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and had him crouch on the floor of a White House car to escape the attention of reporters. The president, who has spent 444 days in his home state since taking office in January 1981, will return to the White House on Jan. 5. After he leaves office Jan. 20, he and the first lady will move to <ORGANIZATION> Bel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>. The $ 2.5 million home was purchased by <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> friends of the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION>, who are leasing it to them.

 A man who was being chased by police through the <ORGANIZATION> Port </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> bus terminal Friday turned on his pursuers and tried to pull a loaded <PERSON> Uzi </PERSON> submachine gun from his pants, police said. The gun got stuck. `` It's a rather large gun and this particular individual was 5-foot-3 and 220 pounds,'' said Officer <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Terribile </PERSON>, one of the arresting officers. `` It got stuck on some clothing. Thank God it did.'' The gun was fully loaded with 20 rounds of 9mm ammunition. `` One round was in the chamber ready to fire,'' said <PERSON> Terribile </PERSON>. `` It sounds funny but it could have been a really tragic situation. The terminal was pretty full with holiday travellers heading out of town.'' The incident occurred about 2 a.m. after <PERSON> Terribile </PERSON> and Sgt. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, both in plainclothes, arrested <PERSON> Rasheem </PERSON> <PERSON> McAllister </PERSON> for allegedly carrying 163 vials of crack inside a resealed potato chip bag. They had <PERSON> McAllister </PERSON> under surveillance for about 40 minutes and noticed he kept putting down a red tote bag, walking away from it and then coming back to it near the Greyhound bus terminal, <PERSON> Terribile </PERSON> said. They saw him talking to a second man, and when they asked about him, <PERSON> McAllister </PERSON> said, `` ` There's a guy out there with a gun and he's going to kill everybody,''' according to <PERSON> Terribile </PERSON> <PERSON> Terribile </PERSON> and <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> were taking <PERSON> McAllister </PERSON> to the police desk when they noticed a man coming down the opposite escalator. <PERSON> McAllister </PERSON> did, too, and tried to duck. <PERSON> Terribile </PERSON> and <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> chased the man and called to a third officer, <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, that `` this was the guy.'' The suspect, identified as <PERSON> Chidiakl </PERSON> <PERSON> Knight </PERSON>, was fighting to get past other people on the escalator while `` attempting to try and pull the Uzi out of his waistband,'' <PERSON> Terribile </PERSON> said. The officers caught up with him at the bottom of the staircase as the suspect continued tugging at the weapon, the officer said. <PERSON> Knight </PERSON>, 19, of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, was arrested on charges of the attempted murder of a police officer and second-degree criminal possession of a weapon. <PERSON> McAllister </PERSON>, 19, of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, was charged with first-degree criminal possession of a controlled substance.

 <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Dali </PERSON> remained in stable condition Friday, one day after a slight intestinal lesion caused him to vomit blood and suffer nausea, forcing the 84-year-old surrealist painter back into a hospital, doctors said. <PERSON> Dali </PERSON>, last of a generation of famous Spanish artists that included <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Miro </PERSON>, has been in frail health and confined to a wheelchair since he was badly burned in a bedroom fire in August 1984.

<TEXT>
 Jurors in the <PERSON> Bess </PERSON> <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> divorce-fixing trial voted 9-3 in favor of conviction early on but finally decided the prosecution's case was n't strong enough, the panel's forewoman said. `` When we looked the other way and presumed innocence, it forced us to realize that the -LRB- prosecution's -RRB- evidence did n't bear out,'' said <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Berardi </PERSON>, the forewoman in the 12-week trial in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. `` There was some feeling among us that something did happen _ but it was n't borne out by the prosecution,'' said <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Marty </PERSON>, another juror. Late Thursday, the jury acquitted the former <LOCATION> Miss </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, her lover, <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> `` Andy'' <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON> and retired judge <PERSON> Hortense </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON> on charges they conspired to lower <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON>'s alimony payments in return for a $ 19,000-a-year city job for the judge's down-and-out daughter, <PERSON> Sukhreet </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON> was handling the <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON> divorce case. The jury deliberated for four days before clearing the three on all six counts of conspiracy, mail fraud, bribery and obstruction of justice. <PERSON> Sukhreet </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON>'s dramatic, comical and often contradictory testimony as the prosecution's star witness wound up hurting the government's case, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Feldberg </PERSON>, who represented her 76-year-old mother, said Friday. `` I think the prosecution would have been better off if they did n't call her,'' he said at a news conference. `` I do n't think they would have won anyway, but I think they would have been better off without her because she turned the case into daytime television, which is something far different than criminal law.'' If <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> had taken the time to scrutinize what would happen to <PERSON> Sukhreet </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON> on cross-examination, `` he may have had second, third or perhaps, fourth thoughts about bringing this case,'' <PERSON> Feldberg </PERSON> said. `` The real question in this case, it seems to me, is not whether <PERSON> Sukhreet </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON> is a troubled person. Obviously, she has her difficulties,'' he added. `` The real question is why prosecutors who know these difficulties ... would prey upon them and use this young woman to make a case against her mother.'' He said <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON>'s fame as a mover and shaker _ she was the city's cultural affairs commissioner _ may have led the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office to bring the `` There's a mentality that a lot of prosecutors have of, if the target is prominent, it helps you in deciding you want to bring a case,'' <PERSON> Feldberg </PERSON> said, `` and in this case, they had the most prominent public woman in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> as a target.'' <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON>, who Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> credits with helping him win his job 12 years ago, said after the verdict that she was `` grateful for the American judicial system'' and thanked the jury for exonerating her. She was not available for interviews on Friday, said her attorney, <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Hafetz </PERSON>. `` I think she's just resting up a little bit, recouping from the trial.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON> said that in her 19 years as a judge, the trial was `` the best judicial experience I've had.'' <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON>, who is serving a sentence for tax evasion, was returned to a <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> prison. <PERSON> Hafetz </PERSON> said he did n't know <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON>'s immediate plans. He said the trial generated `` a lot of bad publicity'' for her, but added, `` Hopefully this verdict _ a clear verdict vindicating her _ will restore her to a position where she is going to be able to make a significant contribution to our lives.'' `` She's been through hell ... I wish her only well,'' the mayor said Friday. `` I believe our 25 years of friendship will continue,'' said <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, who denounced her as a friend after an investigation he ordered blasted <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> for hiring Ms. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON>. The mayor's offer of friendship did not extend to a job offer. Asked if he would invite her to rejoin his administration, <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said, `` I think that's over with. I think she has new fields to conquer.''

<HEAD>KGB and Police Chiefs Say Ethnic Violence Still Plaguing Caucasus</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> and national police chiefs on Friday called for tougher measures to control ethnic violence that still plagues <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> despite a month of curfews and army patrols in the republics, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported. The official news agency said <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Kryuchkov </PERSON> and Interior Minister <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakatin </PERSON>, head of police and troops charged with keeping order at home, met with other officials to review the special measures taken Nov. 23. On that day, a dusk-to-dawn curfew was put in effect in certain parts of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> to quell ethnic violence that killed at least 31 people. Residents of Armenian and <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, neighboring <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> republics in the <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>, have been at odds historically for cultural and religious reasons. Most Armenians are Christians while most Azerbaijanis are Shiite Moslem. The Soviet prosecutor's office has filed more than 30 criminal cases in court stemming from the violence, and investigators continue to uncover more wrongdoing, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. `` At the same time, the situation in the republics remains complex,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Incidents of violence, thefts, instigatory calls for hurting citizens' rights for national signs, for disobedience to authorities are still being permitted.'' It said special concern was generated by crimes committed in the area of northwestern <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> devastated by an earthquake on Dec. 7. Aside from criticizing `` extremists'' and `` hooliganistic elements,'' a statement released after the meeting blasted law enforcement authorities for not stopping the violence. It said unspecified punitive action was taken against some authorities. The statement promised that the full force of law will be used to stop violence and attempts to spread ethnic hatred. Earlier, this month authorities in the Armenian capital, <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, arrested at least six of the 11 members of the <ORGANIZATION> Karabakh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, an unsanctioned political group agitating for Armenian control of part of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. In February, Armenians launched a campaign of demonstrations and strikes to gain control of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, a predominantly Armenian territory in <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. The central government in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> has refused to accede to Armenians' demands. At the end of February, 32 people, mostly Armenians, were killed in the first major eruption of violence in the dispute. New violence broke out last month, and more than 180,000 people have fled their homes and crossed the border of the two republics.

 Leftist rebels attacked the heavily guarded <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> with car bombs and catapult-launched explosives on Friday, killing at least three people and wounding at least 35, officials said. The assault on the military headquarters compound and on a nearby government health clinic appeared to be part of a major rebel offensive against the U.S.-backed government of President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>. Also on Friday, unidentified terrorists blew up a biology laboratory at <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and shot to death a night watchman, a school official said. The 35,000-student university, the biggest in the nation, has been the scene of recent demonstrations by leftist students. Witnesses said four car bombs exploded just outside the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> and at a health clinic 50 yards down the road in this capital city. A 20-foot-high wall surrounds the compound, which also houses the headquarters of the armed forces joint chiefs-of-staff. Defense Minister Gen. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Eugenio </PERSON> <PERSON> Vides </PERSON> <PERSON> Casanova </PERSON> told a news conference homemade bombs were also launched from catapults. A military officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said three projectiles fell inside the compound. <PERSON> Vides </PERSON> said casualties included 25 passengers in a passing bus who were wounded in the late morning explosions. Dr. <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Galan </PERSON> <PERSON> Avalos </PERSON>, director of the clinic, said flying glass from car bomb explosions injured 10 health workers. About 60 people work in the clinic, which had about 20 patients at the time of the attack, he said. The defense minister said the three people were killed in the attack and homemade bombs destroyed four vehicles and three buildings. `` These are acts of terrorism, acts of desperation because the people have rejected them -LRB- the guerrillas -RRB-. This is nothing more than a bombardment of the civilian population,'' Lt. <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Navarrete </PERSON>, an army officer, told reporters. One victim, 35-year-old <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrade </PERSON>, was running from the initial blasts when another vehicle exploded, killing him instantly, his mother, 60-year-old <PERSON> Inez </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrade </PERSON>, said. She said the explosion blew his leg off. The mother said she sat stunned on the ground next to her son's severed limb until a neighbor brought her a plastic bag minutes later She said she put the leg in the bag, got up and walked away, picking up more pieces of her son's body and placing them in the bag. Pools of blood, shattered furniture and smashed glass lay on the clinic floor. <PERSON> Ana </PERSON> <PERSON> Miriam </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, 52, said had just left a bus and was across the street when the first car bomb went off. `` It scared me out of my wits,'' she said, sobbing. `` My grandchildren play right over there. By the grace of God, nothing happened to them.'' It was the first attack on the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> since the guerrillas launched their war to overthrow the government in October 1979. The conflict has killed an estimated 65,500 people. Terrorists set off three bombs at <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, blowing up a biology laboratory, a school official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. They also shot to death watchman <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Aguirre </PERSON>, he said. No one claimed responsibility and police said they had no clues. University Rector <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Argueta </PERSON> <PERSON> Antillon </PERSON> accused the military, the government and right-wing terrorists of responsibility, but offered no evidence. Five provincial town mayors resigned on Friday, bringing to 12 the number of mayors who quit in the past three months after guerrilla death threats. The rebels killed nine mayors in 1988, saying they `` executed'' the mayors for their part in installing `` the U.S.-imposed counterinsurgency plan.''

 A <LOCATION> Yugoslav </LOCATION> relief flight to the earthquake zone in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> crashed Dec. 12 because the pilots set the Soviet-built plane's altitude instruments improperly, a Soviet investigator said Friday. The crash at <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, the Armenian capital, killed all seven people on the An-12 transport. It was the second plane crash in the international relief airlift that followed the Dec. 7 earthquake that killed at least 55,000 people. A plane carrying Soviet soldiers crashed the day before while approaching to land at the quake-ravaged city of <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION>, killing the 78 people aboard. <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION>, the government newspaper, quoted the head of a commission investigating the Yugoslav crash as saying ground controllers gave the pilots correct information but they did not confirm receiving it and the controllers did not request confirmation. <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Teimurazov </PERSON>, the commission chairman, said the pilots did not set their altimeters or prepare for landing by extending landing gear and wing flaps, <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> reported. `` It is absolutely obvious that the Yugoslav pilots were in a hurry,'' the paper commented. `` This is understandable: they wanted to deliver the quake relief supplies as soon as possible.'' Shortly after the crash, the official Yugoslav news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> quoted a <LOCATION> Yugoslav </LOCATION> pilot who landed at <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> later as saying the accident may have resulted from a misunderstanding between the crew and ground controllers.

 The chief judge in the trial of confessed <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> hijacker <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> said Friday that another <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> witness will be asked to travel to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and testify. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> <PERSON> Moon </PERSON>, a physician, sat near <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>, who was beaten and killed during the hijacking. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> is charged with murder and air piracy in the June 1985 commandeering of <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> Flight 847 to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, in which 39 Americans were held hostage 17 days. He admits being one of the hijackers, but denies killing <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>. Chief Judge <PERSON> Heiner </PERSON> <PERSON> Mueckenberger </PERSON> said <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> would be asked to testify when the trial resumes Jan. 17 after a holiday recess. According to court records, <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> sat near <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> after the diver was beaten and before he was killed. <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> was shot behind a closed curtain and no one has testified to seeing who killed him. More than two dozen American passengers and crew have testified since the trial began nearly six months ago, describing how <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> and the other hijacker, identifed in court records as <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ezzeddine </PERSON>, beat <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> and other passengers. Also at Friday's session, <PERSON> Mueckenberger </PERSON> discussed a defense motion made Dec. 13 that President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Nabih </PERSON> <PERSON> Berri </PERSON>, leader of the Shiite Moslem militia <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, be asked to testify. <PERSON> Gabriele </PERSON> <PERSON> Steck-Bromme </PERSON>, a defense lawyer, said at the time she wanted <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> and <PERSON> Berri </PERSON> to be questioned about what she called a pledge by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities not to prosecute the hijackers if the <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> airplane hostages were released. <PERSON> Berri </PERSON> was instrumental in negotiating the release and the hostages were taken to <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, capital of <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mueckenberger </PERSON> said Friday he did not feel testimony by <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> or <PERSON> Berri </PERSON> had `` any meaning'' in the case and doubted either would come if asked. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials denied when the hostages were released that any deal had been made.

<TEXT>
 A research company has developed a smokestack device far more effective than those now in use at removing sulfur dioxide, the chief cause of acid rain, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> engineering professor says. <PERSON> Leonardt </PERSON> <PERSON> Kreisle </PERSON> said the `` synergistic reactor,'' developed by <ORGANIZATION> Aerological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> with help from UT engineering students, removes virtually all sulfur dioxide from smokestack emissions. `` Dry-air scrubbers'' now in use are more expensive to make and use and remove only 60 percent to 70 percent of the chemical, he said. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ewan </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Aerological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Daingerfield </LOCATION>, said the company has a prototype that can remove 10 pounds a minute of sulfur dioxide _ too little for a power plant _ but plans to build one big enough to remove 5,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide a minute for power plants and factories. Sulfur dioxide is a byproduct of steel manufacturing, refining and coal burning. It combines with nitrous oxide, sunlight and rain to form acid. The government has said that a solution to the acid problem will cost billions of dollars. The patent application for the device was accepted by the government in November. <PERSON> Ewan </PERSON> said the company is negotiating with manufacturers to produce the devices for the market next year. `` We've not looked at the price yet,'' he said, `` but it will cost a lot less than conventional scrubbers. The design is quite simple even though the operation is sophisticated.'' <PERSON> Kreisle </PERSON> said he is not a participant in the patent and has no financial stake in the device. He said it is a fraction of the size of comparable dry-air scrubbers, operates on about a third of the energy, acts more quickly, and leaves only dry gypsum, or chalk, as a byproduct. The reactor is housed in a steel tube 24 feet long and 6 inches in diameter and is designed to replace the uppermost part of a smokestack. Gases formed by burning of coal and other organic materials enter a reactor chamber filled with steam and ground lime. A resulting chemical action removes the sulfur dioxide, according to the developers.

<TEXT>
 The government announced Friday it will allow the 5-year-old state of emergency to lapse next month, hoping that Sinhalese radicals will stop engaging in violence and join the democratic process. `` It is our present intention not to extend the emergency when it lapses on Jan. 15,'' the national security minister, <PERSON> Lalith </PERSON> <PERSON> Athulathmudali </PERSON>, told a news conference. He said the government will also consider releasing 2,200 political prisoners and reopening schools and universities closed for up to three years due to the violence. The emergency was imposed in May 1983 in an effort to quell an insurgency by minority Tamils against the Sinhalese majority that has left 8,500 people dead. Parliament has extended the emergency every month since then, giving security forces sweeping powers to search homes, arrest and detain people without charge and shoot violators. For 17 months, the extremist Sinhalese group the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> has waged a campaign to overthrow the government, saying it conceded too much to the Tamils in a 1987 peace accord The accord provides for limited autonomy for the Tamils and places 47,000 Indian peacekeeping soldiers on Sri Lankan soil. The Tamils, who are mostly Hindus, complain they have been denied jobs and education by the Sinhalese, who run the government and the military. Tamils comprise 18 percent and the predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sinhalese </ORGANIZATION> make up 75 percent of the island's 16 million people. Prime Minister <PERSON> Ranasinghe </PERSON> <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON>, a Sinhalese, was elected president last Monday and called on Sinahlese extremists to end the violence and join the democratic process. Parliamentary elections are to be held Feb. 15. <PERSON> Athulathumadali </PERSON> said he did not know whether extremists responded to <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON>'s appeal for peace but added: `` Incidents of violence appear to be less and there seems to be no clear rejection to the open, wide-angled request for them to come into the political mainstream.''

<TEXT>
 Nearly a year after a polygamist clan began a fatal confrontation with the law, a jury's verdict has ended another chapter in a saga begun 15 years ago on the family's northern <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> homestead The homicide convictions of three young clan members, said one prosecutor, puts to rest the `` legend of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON>,'' whose 1979 death at the hands of <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> lawmen triggered the bombing of a Mormon chapel last January and the clan's 13-day armed standoff at their Marion farm. An eight-member 3rd District Court jury in <LOCATION> Coalville </LOCATION> on Thursday convicted clan patriarch <PERSON> Addam </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON>, 27, and Singer's son, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON>, 22, of manslaughter in the death of state Corrections Lt. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> House </PERSON>, gunned down during a botched arrest that ended the siege. <PERSON> Addam </PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON>, 21, was convicted of negligent homicide. Singer admitted firing the fatal shot and <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> said he also shot his rifle, but <PERSON> Addam </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON>, who was seriously wounded by an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> sharpshooter, insisted he never fired. `` It's over,'' said Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwendiman </PERSON>, who also prosecuted the trio and Singer's widow, <PERSON> Vickie </PERSON>, in federal court last spring. `` They just simply ca n't bring <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON> out to justify what they have done and want to do,'' he said. `` It's over, and if this year has n't proved that in <LOCATION> spades </LOCATION>, nothing will.'' It was 1973 when <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON>, a German immigrant and excommunicated Mormon who embraced polygamy and other Mormon fundamentalist beliefs, pulled his children from public schools he believed were rife with dangerously liberal teachings. But the decision to keep the children out of school embroiled him in an escalating dispute with the law, and in 1979, one of several deputies trying to serve an arrest warrant felled him with a shotgun blast when he purportedly brandished a pistol. Clan members believe <PERSON> Singer </PERSON> was shot in the back as part of a conspiracy among lawmen and the <ORGANIZATION> Mormon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, which banned polygamy in 1890. <PERSON> Vickie </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON> kept her six children on the farm, although Singer's second wife left. In 1980, the farm became home to Addam Swapp, also an excommunicated <PERSON> Mormon </PERSON>, whose married two of Mrs. Singer's daughters. The ensuing years brought a series of troubles, including feuds with neighbors over water rights and an accident that left <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON> a paraplegic. A federal judge dismissed Mrs. Singer's wrongful death lawsuit in 1987, fueling the family's distrust of secular and religious authority Summit County Sheriff <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Eley </PERSON> said <PERSON> Addam </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON> further antagonized the community late in last year when he began sending fiery letters to state and local officials, accusing them of murdering Singer and containing religious references to bloodshed and destruction. <PERSON> Eley </PERSON> obtained an arrest warrant after <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON> fired a gun into the air when <PERSON> Eley </PERSON> went to the farm to talk to him. Swapp remained holed up on the farm until the night of Jan. 16, when he planted 87 sticks of dynamite in the chapel, an act he said was a divinely inspired signal for Singer's resurrection and the fall of a corrupt church and state. It was the bombing of the chapel that touched off the siege that ended in <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s death. `` <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON> never would have blown up a church or done anything like that,'' <PERSON> Eley </PERSON> said. `` I could see where <PERSON> John </PERSON> was coming from, and I saw <PERSON> Addam </PERSON> as nothing more than a terrorist.'' Sentincing on the state convictions was set for Jan. 20. <PERSON> Addam </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON> faces a sentence of five years to life, as does <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON> faces a maximum of a year in jail. The three already have received federal sentences of 10 or 15 years for the bombing convictions. Mrs. Singer is serving a five-year federal term; she was not charged in state court. <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON>, who wept as he held two of his sons after the trial, did not make a public statement after Thursday's verdicts. But his elder wife, <PERSON> Heidi </PERSON>, said she still believes in her husband's cause and in his innocence. `` This is in God's hands,'' she said. `` Only God knows the truth.'' The Singer-Swapp family remains on the farm in <LOCATION> Marion </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>. The family has been peaceful, but <PERSON> Eley </PERSON> said their neighbors still keep watch for any unusual activity. `` How long it will last, I do n't know, <PERSON> Eley </PERSON> said. `` I hope it's over, and maybe they do, too Maybe they've been through enough.''

<HEAD>Officers To Stand Trial For Allegedly Terrorizing Crack Dealer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Eight police officers accused of terrorizing crack houses have been ordered to stand trial for allegedly entering an apartment illegally, then covering up their actions. Two also are accused of force-feeding a dealer crack cocaine. The officers `` tried to do something legal in an illegal way,'' 36th District Court Judge <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Donahue </PERSON> said Thursday in ordering the trial. `` They conducted what I believe was a police raid without a search warrant.'' But defense lawyers protested that a trial would hamper <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>'s war against the highly addictive drug by making officers hesitant to aggressively pursue dealers `` When police officers start playing it very, very, very safe, the city becomes very unsafe,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, attorney for <PERSON> Cedric </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, 27, who along with <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Darbins </PERSON>, 22, is charged with assault for allegedly forcing an admitted dealer to eat 20 `` rocks'' _ little chunks _ of crack. All eight officers were charged with entry without permission, a misdemeanor, and with conspiracy to conceal a crime, a felony. They have been suspended without pay since August. In the Feb. 21 incident, officers entered an apartment where the dealer, <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, was alone. He contends police beat him. Then, when six of the officers left, the remaining two made him eat the crack, he testified at a two-week preliminary hearing. The eight are also accused of breaking into another home, also suspected to be a crack house, the same night, and assaulting its occupants. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, 26, said he had sold $ 100 worth of crack cocaine the night of Feb. 20 and had cash and 20 bags of crack on a living room table when police with drawn guns came in. Another witness who was in an apartment across the hall from <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, testified to overhearing someone say, `` Eat this ... If you do n't, I'll take you to jail,'' followed by laughter. <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> prosecutors say <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> may have saved his life after police left by drinking vinegar to induce vomiting. He was treated for a cocaine overdose at <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Receiving </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. A trial date was not set, but arraignment was scheduled for Jan. 13 in Recorders Court. The officers, free on $ 10,000 personal bonds, left the raids out of their reports and logs, a violation of department policy, prosecutors say. `` The police, in carrying out their duties, are required to follow the law just like everybody else,'' said <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Assistant Prosecutor <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 The holiday spirit will take on a somber tone Saturday when this community remembers 73 people, most of them children, who were crushed to death or suffocated at a Christmas Eve party 75 years ago. The town council voted this week to hold a memorial service at the site where 57 children and 16 adults died. They were killed in a human stampede after someone yelled a false fire alarm at a party sponsored by a union group at the height of a bitter strike. `` I do n't suppose it will ever heal,'' said amateur historian <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON>. At the time of the tragedy, members of the <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Miners </ORGANIZATION> had been on strike for 10 months over the <LOCATION> Calumet </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Hecla </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to switch from two-man drills to one-man drills. The union said the new drill was unsafe. In the weeks before the disaster, two company guards chased a striker into a boardinghouse and fired gunshots, killing two men; three non-union Canadian miners were gunned down as they slept; and miner and a guard were killed in another shootout. On Christmas Eve, the union's women's committee held a party for the children of striking miners on the second floor of Calumet's Italian Hall, above a saloon While the party was under way, witnesses said, someone from the first floor stairwell shouted out a fire alarm. Children and adults raced to escape, tripping over each other to get into the stairwell and out the only exit. Witnesses said the victims were crushed to death or suffocated before anyone realized what was happening. `` I was so scared,'' said <PERSON> Lena </PERSON> <PERSON> Rigotti </PERSON>, an 88-year-old <PERSON> Hurley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, nursing home resident who survived the tragedy. `` I told my sister, ` Stay with me and we'll get home.' I do n't know how we ever made it.''' Nobody ever found out who sounded the false alarm, <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Homeless Activist Found Guilty Of Trespassing For Occupying Vacant
House</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Homeless activist <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> was found guilty Friday of trespassing for occupying a vacant, federally owned house last August with a group of homeless women and children. King, 36, was given a 10-day suspended sentence. She could have faced up to 180 days in jail and a fine of $ 999. King, who ran a shelter for the homeless that has since closed, led a group of 14 women and 26 children from her shelter who spent a weekend in the house last August. She was arrested after refusing an order to leave; the other protesters left voluntarily. The vacant building was the property of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, which had obtained it when the buyer defaulted on a federally backed mortgage. On Aug. 16, one day after King's arrest, <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> agreed to make 55 more homes available to qualified homeless shelter providers in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>. Before then, 14 homes had been made available to the <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> Coalition for the Homeless, but <PERSON> King </PERSON> said they were all full. King and her attorneys argued she acted under duress because of her commitment to <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>'s homeless. She testified Thursday that `` there was no shelter or afforadable housing'' in the area at the time of the protest and she `` did n't know what else to do.'' `` They can arrest me if I'm a criminal for trying to find these people a house,'' she recalled telling the arresting police officers. Prosecutors maintained the case was a clear-cut one of trespassing. `` You will hear that <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> works for the homeless. She cares for the homeless. She is deeply concerned about the homeless,'' said Assistant City Attorney <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Dash </PERSON> on Thursday. `` In the course of caring deeply about the homeless, this defendant broke the law.'' Earlier in the week, <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Court Judge <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Satter </PERSON> denied King's motion to use a `` choice of evils'' defense, which would have allowed her to be acquitted if the jury found she trespassed to prevent a greater evil _ in this case, homelessness. The last witness to testify in the trial on Friday morning was <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON> <PERSON> Roybal </PERSON>, a former homeless woman who broke into tears while describing to the court her life on streets and in shelters.

 An <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> jumbo jet bound for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with 250 people aboard returned to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> on Friday after a bomb threat, and a <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> terminal was evacuated after officials spotted an unattended suitcase. Nothing suspicious was immediately found on the plane, the airline said. The incidents came hours after a British Airways Tristar, which was forced to make a 10-hour unscheduled stop in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> because of a bomb threat, arrived at <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, the airline said. The bomb-related incidents followed Wednesday's explosion of a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747, bound for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, over the Scottish village of <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>. At <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION>, large crowds of Christmas holiday travelers waited for their flights Friday apparently undeterred by the crash of the jumbo jet. There was no indication of any increase in security, which is considered to be on a continuous high level, and there appeared to be no new security checks. Air India in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> received a bomb threat from an anonymous caller after its <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 left <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> at 2:59 p.m., an airline spokesman said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The threat was passed to the captain, who decided to return to <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION>, the spokesman said. The 747 landed and taxied to an isolated area southwest of the terminals, the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airports </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> said. Passengers left the plane normally and were taken by bus to a terminal. Hours later, the airline announced it had not yet found anything suspicious during a search of the plane. It offered the passengers seats on another flight Saturday morning. Earlier Friday, an unattended suitcase in a terminal at the airport prompted authorities to evacuate hundreds of Christmas travelers, airport officials said. A bomb squad found only clothing in the suitcase. Police said they were told a man had walked into the terminal, left the suitcase and departed. In the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> incident, authorities closed <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Leonardo </PERSON> <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Vinci </PERSON> airport for 20 minutes Thursday while the plane made an emergency landing and its 242 passengers and 12 crew were removed No bomb was found. A caller to the airline's <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> office said a bomb was on board, said airline spokesman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Blunt </PERSON>. Flight 146 originated in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>, made a stopover in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and was flying to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> when it was diverted.

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> came home Friday after five days in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and said his visit restored the friendly Indian-Chinese relations of the early 1950s. Also Friday, about 100 Tibetan students outside <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> set fire to a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> flag and denounced <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s recognition of <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> as part of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Police with bamboo canes watched the rally but did generally not interfere. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> told a news conference at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>'s international airport, `` I believe this visit will be a new beginning for both countries.'' A border dispute has strained relations between <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, the world's two most populous countries, for nearly three decades. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has more than 1 billion people, and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has about 800 million. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s visit to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> was the first by an Indian prime minister since his grandfather, <PERSON> Jawaharlal </PERSON> <PERSON> Nehru </PERSON>, visited <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in 1954. The two countries issued a communique in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> earlier Friday, agreeing to set up a joint working group to take up the territorial dispute, which led to war in 1962. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> said the group would set a time frame in which to resolve the issue. The communique also said Chinese Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> has accepted an invitation to visit <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>, but no date was set. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> claims 36,000 square miles of mountainous frontier that <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> says is part of its Arunachal Pradesh state. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> also says <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> illegally occupies 14,500 square miles in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Kashmir </LOCATION> state. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> also told reporters that Chinese leaders respected <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s views on <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>, another sore point in relations <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> invaded mountainous <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> in 1949 and annexed it a year later. The communique noted that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> `` expressed concern over anti-China activities by some Tibetan elements in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>,'' and that the Indian side had repeated its policy of recognizing <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> as a part of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and banning Tibetans from carrying out anti-Chinese political activities on Indian soil. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has granted asylum to the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>'s religious leader, and thousands of his followers who fled <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> after an abortive uprising against Chinese rule in 1959. <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> blames supporters of the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> for pro-independence activities that led to clashes with police in the last 14 months. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> on Thursday signed three agreements _ a civil aviation accord calling for direct flights between <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, a three-year cultural agreement, and a science and technology pact.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military forces in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> said Friday they were halting all live firing training at an <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION> range where neighbors complained that bullets strayed into nearby residential areas. The announcement by <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Forces <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> did not refer directly to complaints that followed exercises Oct. 15 at a Camp Hansen firing range on the southern Japanese island. But it said `` senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have expressed deep regret over recent incidents and have emphasized the respect and appreciation American military forces feel for the people of <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION> and their culture.'' After local officials said nine bullets were reported found in a village opposite the range's target area. No one was reported injured, but two Foreign Ministry officials went to <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION> last month to talk with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> generals and inspect firing ranges. The announcement also said that demonstration flights by F-15 jet fighters at <LOCATION> Kadena </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION>, also on <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION>, were suspended indefinitely. It gave no reason. Maj. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothfork </PERSON>, spokeman for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, said safety regulations for other firing ranges had been reviewed, permanent safety officers would be present for all live firing training, the direction of firing would be restricted, and safety education would be increased. Weeks after the firing range complaints, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ship fired practice shells that landed about 330 yards from a <ORGANIZATION> Japanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> vessel near the entrance to <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> immediately expressed regret, and relieved the ship's skipper of command. But the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> lodged a protest with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, and Japanese newspaper editorials published blistering editorials. About 64,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops are in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> under a security treaty.

 The cockpit recording of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103's final minutes ended with a brief, mysterious `` faint noise'' and gave no sign that the pilots knew their <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 was doomed, investigators said Friday. Conversations captured by the `` black box'' that records all cockpit activity was normal up to the `` faint noise at the end which needs a bit more analysis,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> McKie </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. <PERSON> Mick </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> of the department's Air Accident Investigation Branch, who is heading a team of 40 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and British investigators at the crash site, said: `` We have no evidence whatsoever yet of sabotage.'' The plane, flying from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, broke up at 31,000 feet Wednesday night, killing all 258 people aboard and bombarding the Scottish countryside with flaming wreckage over a 10-mile radius. Flowers arrived at the scene Friday. A passenger who had left the flight at <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> sent a bouquet to a child flying on to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, with the message: `` To the little girl in the red dress who lies here, who made my flight from <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> such fun. You did n't deserve this.'' Suspicions of sabotage were prompted by the inexplicable sudden breakup of the plane, a claim of responsibility and disclosures that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government had been warned of a plot to bomb a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> flight between <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in December. Flight 103 originated in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> with a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727, and switched to a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. Soldiers hacked open the nose section, lying on its side in a field, and removed the bodies of crew members on stretchers and under tarpaulins. From 20 to 30 relatives of victims arrived in <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, the Scottish village that bore the brunt of the crash, and 155 bodies were placed in makeshift morgues in the town hall and ice rink. The relatives included at least seven Americans. They were advised against visiting the wreckage, said Superintendent <PERSON> Angus </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, a police spokesman in <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>. More than 600 police and military personnel spent Friday scouring the countryside for bodies and wreckage, but only one more body was found. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said whether it was of a passenger or ground victim was not known. Fourteen adults and three children were missing in the <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION> area and there was no word on the occupants of three cars hit by wreckage and gutted on a nearby highway, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. He said it had been learned the driver of a fourth car was treated for injuries Wednesday night and released, and the driver of a fifth car was a villager and counted among the 17 residents listed as missing. Arc lights and heavy lifting equipment were brought in to speed the search. Searchers moved shoulder to shoulder across fields and marshes, trying to collect every scrap of evidence. A faint smell of aviation fuel lingered. During the night, a party of Jewish youths clambered over the rubble, apparently searching for holy items like prayer books that might have been with Jewish passengers and require ritual burial. All indications were that the plane broke up in seconds, and that the cockpit never knew of the imminent catastrophe. `` There were no abnormal noises on the -LRB- cockpit recorder's -RRB- tape until the signals ended abruptly with the aircraft cruising at 31,000 feet,'' said <PERSON> McKie </PERSON>. There was `` nothing in the conversations to indicate anything was wrong,'' he said, adding that no conclusions could be drawn yet from the noise at the end of the tape. On Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Channon </PERSON> said the plane's radar blip on the Scottish ground control screens `` split into several returns'' before vanishing <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> told a news conference the wreckage was `` spread over a very, very long wreckage trail,'' but added this did not indicate sabotage. The spread was normal, given the plane's altitude and the 115-knot winds at 31,000 feet. People have found papers, clothing and mail up to 70 miles from <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>. Three teen-age boys found a bundle of $ 500,000 in travelers' checks in the hills near their home six miles from <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, police said Friday. `` To try and prejudge this case would be totally wrong. There are obviously a number of potential causes for an in-flight breakup. We are looking for evidence to try and point us in the right direction. To suggest that it would be one or the other at this stage would be wrong,'' <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> said. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> sent a message to the 2,500 people of <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION> saying: `` Our hearts go out to you on this tragic occasion which marred what should have been a season of joy.'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Park </PERSON> of the local district council wrote back: `` Our small community has suffered much but our sadness is even greater when we think of the loss of so many people from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Our thoughts are with their friends and relatives wherever they may be.'' A newspaper Friday quoted a security source as saying investigators were taking `` very seriously'' a group's claim of responsibility. The Independent quoted the source as saying the group is thought to have sought revenge for the July 3 downing of an Iranian jetliner by a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warship in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. An anonymous caller to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> claimed Thursday the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution was responsible for the crash. A political dispute arose over the <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s disclosure that it knew of a bomb threat two weeks before the crash but did not pass it on to <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> or the public <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials told British officials that an anonymous caller to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, said Dec. 5 that a bomb would be planted aboard a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> flight from <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> within two weeks. Transport Minister <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Portillo </PERSON> said it was `` confidential, classified <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence information and we did n't have the right to divulge it.'' He said the warning prompted an assessment of <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> security for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flights. The security was judged to be appropriate. Also on Friday: _ An <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> jumbo jet bound for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with 250 people aboard returned to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> after <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> received an anonymous bomb threat, officials said The plane was evacuated at <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> but the airline said nothing suspicious was found. _ An unattended suitcase found at <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> forced hundreds of Christmas travelers to evacuate one of four terminals for nearly an hour, but it was found to contain only clothing, officials said _ A <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tristar </ORGANIZATION> arrived at <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> after making a 10-hour unscheduled stop in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> because of a bomb threat

 The former chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION>'s board of trustees said Friday that he did not influence a disciplinary panel that suspended two student journalists although he was unhappy with their publication. At a court hearing to determine whether the two stdents should be reinstated, <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> McCulloch </PERSON> testified his initial reaction to the off-campus, conservative <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION> was favorable. `` I thought it was extremely important to have a conservative viewpoint demonstrated and published on campus,'' <PERSON> McCulloch </PERSON> said in <ORGANIZATION> Grafton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. `` But I became really disenchanted when the Review began to go away from a focus on the issues and began to focus on personalities.'' <PERSON> McCulloch </PERSON> said, however, that he did not try to influence the campuswide disciplinary board that suspended former Review editors <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Baldwin </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutter </PERSON> for 18 months in March. <PERSON> Baldwin </PERSON>, 21, of <LOCATION> Hinsdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Sutter </PERSON>, 22, of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> want Judge <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohl </PERSON> to let them return to school before their suspensions expire in September. <PERSON> Mohl </PERSON> is expected to rule before classes resume Jan. 3. They and two other students were accused of harassing music professor <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> during a classroom confrontation after a Review article disparaged <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>'s course. Cole, who is black, once was described by the Review as looking `` like a used Brillo pad.'' He testified this week that he considered the latest Review criticisms racially motivated, a charge denied by <PERSON> Sutter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Baldwin </PERSON>. The hearing ended Friday after the judge prevented the school's lawyer from trying to show that the former editors sought a heavy penalty in order to generate more publicity for their case <PERSON> Mohl </PERSON> ruled as irrelevant an attempt by <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION> lawyer <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Middleton </PERSON> to show that <PERSON> Baldwin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sutter </PERSON> intentionally sought the 18-month suspension. <PERSON> Middleton </PERSON> argued it was `` extremely relevant'' because it was `` important to get a maximum suspension and therefore to get maximum press exposure.'' The students' lawyer, <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON>, disputed <PERSON> Middleton </PERSON>'s claim, calling it `` one of the most extraordinary things I've ever heard.'' When the hearing began Monday, <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> said the suspensions had national implications because of their chilling effect on college journalists nationwide. But <PERSON> Mohl </PERSON> also called that argument irrelevant. The two students argue that <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION> discriminates against conservatives, disciplining them for infractions more harshly than liberal students, a charge college officials deny. Two lawsuits, one in state and one in federal court, have been filed against the school based on this allegation.

 While there may be no quick answers to the tragedy of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103, the wreckage scattered across the Scottish countryside has left enough clues to make it virtually certain the cause will be found, aviation experts said Friday. As more information surfaced, specialists noted the similarities between Wednesday's crash of the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> that killed all 258 people aboard and leaving at least 17 people missing on the ground, and the crash three years ago of an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> jumbo jet off the Irish coast. Indian officials after months of retrieving wreckage from the ocean floor concluded that a bomb exploded aboard the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> jetliner. An explosion is widely believed to have caused the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> plane to crash, although no conclusive evidence of a bombing has yet surfaced. Both the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> planes were cruising routinely at 31,000 feet and suddenly disappeared from radar. In neither case did the flight crew declare an emergency or make any radio contact with air traffic control. In both cases, the planes broke up in the air, scattering wreckage over five or more miles. In both crashes, the recording from the cockpit gave no indication the pilots were aware of any unusual, but contained a muffled sound in the final split second of tape. That sound became crucial in the Air <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> investigation. The final report on the accident concluded: `` From the sounds found recorded on the CVR -LRB- cockpit voice recorder -RRB- and the -LRB- air traffic control -RRB- tapes it appears that an explosion had occurred on board the aircraft.'' Authorities in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> announced Friday that a preliminary review of the <ORGANIZATION> CVR </ORGANIZATION> tape from <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 also ends with a muffled sound a fraction of a second before the recorder went dead. `` There is nothing in the conversation -LRB- of the pilots -RRB- to indicate anything was wrong,'' said a British spokesman, reminiscent of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> findings. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> McKie </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION>, cautioned that further analysis will be required before it can be determined what the noise might be and warned not `` to jump to any conclusions.'' More sophisticated spectrographic examination of the tape likely will provide a better clue as to whether the sound is an explosion from a bomb, or a breakup of the aircraft because of a sudden decompression. Similar sounds have been heard on <ORGANIZATION> CVR </ORGANIZATION> taps in other accidents when aircraft experienced major structural failures, officials said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aviation experts, including several who have been involved in investigating scores of air disasters, are confident the answers will be found. `` It will be a massive job to reconstruct the pieces,'' said <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Schleede </PERSON>, chief of aviation accident investigation at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. `` But they're going to solve it because the evidence will be there.'' `` We will know what brought down <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> 103,'' <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> said, but he cautioned `` it could take months.'' Neither <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Schleede </PERSON>, who has been briefed daily by telephone by <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> officials at the crash site, would discuss specifically the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> findings so far. But <PERSON> Schleede </PERSON> and other experts noted in interviews that the <ORGANIZATION> Pam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> crash investigators have some advantages. For example: _ While the crash caused an inferno in the small Scottish farming town of <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, destroying a row of houses, most of the aircraft _ with the exception of a destroyed right wing whose fuel tank exploded _ appeared to have escaped serious fire damage In many crashes where a plane remains intact and burst into flames, critical clues are lost because of the intense heat that bends metal and destroys evidence. _ The wreckage, although strewn across the countryside, is not _ as was the case of <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> _ in hundreds of feet of water and exposed to elements that could destroy critical evidence _ The cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder appear to be in good shape In the coming days, investigators will pay close attention to how parts of the aircraft are bent, tangled and singed and whether there is evidence of a chemical residue normally left by an explosive. They also will search for fragments that might have been used as a detonator and closely examine luggage and parts of luggage as well as aircraft wreckage holes left by flying fragments. Such holes leave a distinctive pattern if caused by an explosion, one expert said. Some of the wreckage will be reassembled as closely as possible to the original aircraft and metallurgists will try to determine how the pieces broke apart. Was it from metal fatigue or from being torn apart. Which part of an aircraft broke first? Did the pieces break apart along specific seams of the aircraft's skin? The flight data recorder, which monitors the performance of the aircraft, and the cockpit voice recorder will be examined and their times coordinated. A key question is whether all of the plane's electrical systems were knocked out simultaneously, one veteran investigator said It is known that <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 in rapid order lost its radar transponder, radio contact and both flight and cockpit voice recorders, this investigator said. If all of these functions failed simultaneously, there is strong evidence of a massive electrical failure, possibly cause by an explosion near the forward baggage compartment, which is adjacent to the electrical and computer systems on the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747, experts suggested.

 In a high school gymnasium against a backdrop of honor rolls dating back four decades, a <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> officer dispatches helicopter crews to hoist bodies and wreckage from the Scottish countryside. In the school's library, where children's paintings are taped to the book shelves, <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> staff cluster around Flight 103's passenger lists, trying to match bodies to names. Outside the town hall, which contains more than 80 bodies, are typewritten lists of villagers evacuated from their homes when the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 fell from the sky. So while the town hall is now a morgue, the red-brick <ORGANIZATION> Lockerbie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION>, the town's only high school, has become headquarters for the search and investigation operation for <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s worst ever air crash. The 900 students, from surrounding villages, are on Christmas vacation. Their school has been taken over by the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Battalion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fusiliers </ORGANIZATION>, one of <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>'s oldest regiments. They have set up operations on the school hall stage. Officers work under a board bearing the regiment's name and its previous title, Princess <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON>'s Own <LOCATION> Glasgow </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ayrshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regiment </ORGANIZATION>. People drift by and stop to read the list posted outside the town hall. A policeman on guard tries to be reassuring. `` Just because a name is n't there does n't mean they're dead,'' he tells each person who looks at the list. Indeed, on Friday a <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION> woman listed as missing turned out to be staying with relatives. But police list 17 other villagers as missing, and the fate of occupants of three cars that were gutted by falling debris on the nearby highway was not known. Authorities updated their list of missing saying the driver of one car hit by flaming wreckage was treated for injuries and released, and the occupant of another vehicle had been counted twice. The rest of the 155 bodies collected by nightfall Friday are in the <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION> skating rink. Flowers are piling up outside the makeshift morgues. A passenger who left the flight in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> sent a bouquet to a child flying on to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with the message: `` To the little girl in the red dress who lies here, who made my flight from <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> such fun. You did n't deserve this.'' Paper Christmas decorations made by the pupils dangle from exercise bars in the school hall. Class blackboards carry lists for dog handlers, helicopter crews and police who scour the countryside for bodies and debris. Soldiers in camouflage uniforms and berets with the distinctive white cockade of Scottish regiments trudge out with spades or drive away in army trucks. During the night, Jewish youths from <LOCATION> Gateshead </LOCATION> in northern <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> clambered over rubble, apparently looking for fragments of holy items belonging to Jews on the plane. They were sent here by the <LOCATION> Gateshead </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hevre </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kadisha </LOCATION>, or burial society. Police from the <LOCATION> Dumfries </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Galloway </LOCATION> <LOCATION> county </LOCATION> force, which with 350 uniformed officers is the tiniest in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, mingle with police from forces throughout <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. Officers from the huge neighboring county force, the 7,000-member <LOCATION> Strathclyde </LOCATION> Constabulary, have arrived in the hundreds to help out in <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>. In an upstairs classroom, with lesson timetables and advertisements for performances of the Scottish <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orchestra </ORGANIZATION> pinned to notice boards, the head of the <LOCATION> Dumfries </LOCATION> force, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON>, confers with senior officers. The largest classroom is packed with rows of computers into which police and civilian personnel feed every scrap of information brought back from the crash site in <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION> and sprawling out to a 10-mile radius around the town. Anything that is found _ from the vital flight recorders chronicling the airliner's last moments, to a scorched Christmas card addressed to addresses in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ are logged into the computers. `` It's called <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>. That stands for Home Office Large Major Enquiry System,'' said Superintendent <PERSON> Angus </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Strathclyde </LOCATION>'s press officer <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said the local force did n't have such a system, and the computers were brought from <LOCATION> Strathclyde </LOCATION> and other forces. `` They've never had anything like this _ there's never been anything like this in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>,'' he said.

 Speculation that an explosion may have caused a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> jet to crash in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> has prompted the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> to issue a call for increased security at airports worldwide, officials said Friday. <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> told reporters that the security alert was sent to airlines, foreign governments and major airports both in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and abroad on Thursday. He said it was prompted by a combination of factors, including the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> crash Wednesday, the heavy Christmas travel rush and `` what obviously can be considered a heightening of world tensions'' as it pertains to terrorist activities. The alert was not prompted by any single threat or piece of intelligence information, officials said. <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON>, in an interview with a small group of reporters, declined to discuss specifically the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> crash that killed all 258 people aboard a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 jumbo jet and leaving at least 17 people missing on the ground. The plane apparently broke apart in the air, possibly because of a terrorist bomb. The crash came two weeks after the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> sent the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> a bulletin warning that <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> might be the subject of a terrorist bombing on its flights from <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 that crashed was Flight 103, which had originated at <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>. Disclosure of the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> bulletin in early December _ the 23rd such alert this year _ has prompted questions over whether such notices should be shared with the public. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said earlier Friday that a public warning based on an anonymous telephone call _ as was the case with the alert involving <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> _ would have been an overreaction. It `` would literally have closed down air traffic in the world,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in answer to a reporter's question. <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> praised <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>'s response to the alert at the <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> airport, saying the airline had imposed `` a very heightened level of security.'' He said <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>'s precautions at <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, from which Flight 103 departed 54 minutes before the crash, were still under review. At <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> said, <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> briefed gate personnel about the possible threat, kept ground baggage handlers and caterers `` under constant surveillance'' and checked all luggage by X-ray instead of only at random. All passengers and their bags also were matched prior to boarding, he said. <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> said that while there is no hard evidence of sabotage in connection with Flight 103, he is concerned about the possibility that a bomb could be placed aboard the jetliner at two airports where security precautions are among the best in the world and where a heightened alert was in effect. `` If there was a door -LRB- of opportunity for terrorists -RRB- left open, we've got to find out what allowed that and close that door,'' he said.

 President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has written President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> saying he wants to work toward strengthening world peace, the leftist Sandinista government said Friday. The Nicaraguan rebels issued their Christmas message Friday, vowing not to lay down their arms until there is democracy. `` Certainly it will be a sad Christmas but the near future is filled with hope,'' said the Contras, as the rebels are known. A statement from <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s press office said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s letter was in reply to a message of congratulations <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> sent <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on his election in November. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> recently quoted <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> as saying he would present a peace proposal to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> but insisted any talks with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> center on security issues, not <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s internal politics. For the past eight years, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has pressured the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> to undertake democratic reforms and to cut their military ties with <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has supported the Contras since 1981 as part of that campaign. The Sandinistas came to power in a 1979 popular revolution that overthrew rightist President <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON>, promising to install a `` democratic, pluralistic'' government. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials and opposition leaders accused the Sandinistas of pursuing repressive policies, including national emergency laws of 1980-87 that imposed press censorship and restricted individual freedoms. In 1981, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration cut off all economic aid to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. Three years ago it imposed a trade embargo, saying <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> was a beachhead from which to spread communism in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. U.S.-Nicaraguan talks in 1985 to explore ways of improving relations ended in deadlock. Friday's statement, published by the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> newspaper Barricada under the title ` Message From Bush To <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> received the vice president's letter on Thursday. `` Among other concepts, President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he enthusiastically looked forward to working to strengthen world peace,'' it said. The Contras' message, read by telephone from the group's offices in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, said the rebels will only lay down their arms `` in exchange for a real democracy.'' `` Our combatants maintain their discipline and are ready to defend the honor of the nation,'' the Contra statement said. `` It is not Nicaraguan to try to impose a slave regime when <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> wants liberty.'' In other developments, government technicians speaking on condition of anonymity said work on an eastern port that could receive huge arms shipments was dealt a serious setback by sedimentation from Hurricane Joan in October. Nicaraguan economists have said the government, strapped by a severe economic crisis, does not have the resources necessary to finish the deep water port known as The Bluff. Also on Friday, the pro-government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuevo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diario </ORGANIZATION> said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> donated a TU-154 jetliner and granted state-run <PERSON> Aeronica </PERSON> airline credits to buy two AN-32 passenger planes. It put the cost of the three airliners at $ 52.8 million. The TU-154 can carry 141 pasengers will be used international routes. The AN-32s will be used on domestic flights, replacing older American planes which can not be serviced due to lack of spare parts arising from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade embargo.

 A self-styled <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> driving a <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes-Benz </ORGANIZATION> copied his Cadillac-driving counterpart Friday and doled out $ 10 bills to a hoard of Skid Row homeless.

 Bitterness took hold Friday among friends and relatives of the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> crash victims over the possibility the tragedy was a terrorist attack, and many wondered at the coincidences by which some people and not others were aboard.

The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 en route to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> crashed into a Scottish hamlet Wednesday, killing all 258 on board. The dead included business executives, 35 students taking part in a <ORGANIZATION> Syracuse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> study abroad program and others coming home for the holidays. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> reported that one of the victims was the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>'s chief of station in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, but <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Sondra </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarty </PERSON> said she had no information on any victims being employees of the intelligence agency.

Calls by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> to the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> were not immediately returned. Also among the victims were an Army navigator heading home for the funeral of his sister; a soldier flying home to be with his father while he awaited surgery, and a cabin attendant who planned to retire after the flight. Traffic jams, a ticket mixup and a final exam that lasted too long were among the twists that saved the lives of others who nearly took Flight 103. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> warned <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassies Dec. 7 of a bomb threat against <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> jets out of <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, where Flight 103 originated. Pan Am and law enforcement authorities were notified, but no public warning was issued. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Friday said a public warning would `` literally have closed down all the air traffic in the world.'' `` I certainly think the public should have been warned. They also had a responsibility to find out if the threat was true. If it was true they should not have let anyone get on,'' said <PERSON> Genevieve </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON>, whose son <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Cawley </PERSON>, 43, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, was killed. `` To know how she went, and to know they might have known something like this was going to happen, it would make any mother mad,'' said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON> <PERSON> Weedon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, who lost a 20-year-old daughter. `` I think it is negligent. They should have done something about it, like checked into it.'' <PERSON> Mildred </PERSON> <PERSON> Sachuck </PERSON>, the house mother at a <ORGANIZATION> Syracuse </ORGANIZATION> fraternity that lost a member in the crash and another in a <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> terrorist bombing in 1983, said that if the crash was the work of terrorists, `` We ought to blow'em to hell.'' Among the lucky ones was The Four Tops singing group, which was delayed by a <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. TV taping Lead singer <PERSON> Levi </PERSON> <PERSON> Stubbs </PERSON> said he called his wife to tell her he had missed Flight 103. `` And she was crying and carrying on, and I asked, ` What's the matter?' And she told me what happened,'' he said. Flight attendant <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON>, 41, had planned to open a boutique in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> after 15 years with the airline. `` The terrible tragedy is that this was going to be his last flight,'' said <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> MacMichael </PERSON>, a friend in <LOCATION> Millbrae </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON>, who was flying with his wife and son after serving with the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, said he nearly switched from an earlier <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> flight to Flight 103 because he needed time to come up with $ 76 cash to ship the family dog home `` I was reaching for the phone -LRB- to call <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- when it rang,'' <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> said. It was a friend offering the money. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> called his parents in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> to tell them he was OK. They were `` never so glad to get a collect phone call.'' <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergstrom </PERSON>, 21, an <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> helicopter navigator based in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, was on his way to <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, to be with his father, who was to undergo heart surgery Jan. 9. `` We were going to have our Christmas after the operation, just the main family opening presents,'' said his mother, <PERSON> Audrey </PERSON>.

He did n't have the means to buy new tickets for the flight right way. `` I looked at those pictures and saw my body strewn over <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` I kept getting up during the night to check and see if he was really there,'' his mother, <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON>, said after he arrived home safely. <PERSON> Jennie </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Aikenhead </PERSON>, 21, a student in the <LOCATION> Syracuse </LOCATION> program, had tried to make the flight, but her opera exam ran late. `` That could have been me,'' she said.

 In the recent wave of South African theatrical productions exposing the oppression of apartheid, the most popular is the surprisingly exuberant Broadway musical `` Sarafina!'' Television viewers who do n't expect to be in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> anytime soon can get a taste of the show and a look behind the scenes in an <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> special Wednesday, `` ` Sarafina' ... Words of Freedom, Songs of Hope,'' a one-hour version of documentary maker <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noble </PERSON>'s feature-length film The film includes snippets of the incredibly infectious music composed by <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Masakela </PERSON> and the playwright, <PERSON> Mbongeni </PERSON> <PERSON> Ngema </PERSON>, and touching interviews with the talented cast of black South African teen-agers who tell wrenching tales of repression, beatings and deaths of loved ones, but also express hope for the future. `` I'd seen the play and had always wanted to do something to explain what apartheid did to people,'' said <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> senior executive producer <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON>. `` CBS did a good show last year -LRB- the documentary ` Children of Apartheid' -RRB-. But the way these kids talk about it and act through the play, they explain what happened to them in their own lives. They describe their hope, and after all that has happened to them, they really want to go back.'' The film is `` a departure for us, because there are hardly any <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> people, just the kids and the music,'' <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Chung </PERSON> appears briefly to explain to viewers what they are about to see. At one point, <PERSON> Ngema </PERSON> lectures his young charges about their mission in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` The South African Embassy has ambassadors here, and ambassadors are people who speak for them. The black people of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> do n't have an embassy here, so this is the embassy and you are the ambassadors.'' The kids have been immensely successful. The show opened at <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in October 1987 and moved to the Cort Theater on <LOCATION> Broadway </LOCATION>. It won rave reviews and has been selling out nightly. The show is a loose flow of sketches about the lives of students at <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Isaacson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, a school that prides itself on its political consciousness. <PERSON> Sarafina </PERSON> is a popular girl and one of the student leaders. Many of the musical numbers are joyous, even funny. But late in the play, <PERSON> Sarafina </PERSON>'s incarceration and torture by police _ unseen _ gives fire to the other students' commitment. When she returns unbowed, there is a climactic dance number in which the kids hurl themselves with deadly result at the military figures who double as the on-stage band. In an interview, cast member <PERSON> Dumisani </PERSON> <PERSON> Dlamini </PERSON> describes the reality that inspired the scene. `` I have seen things happening in front of my face. I have seen my brothers dying, and I have seen my heroes dying. So how shall I sit down? I have to stand and fight. Then I'll be free.'' `` Theater in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> at the moment plays a very important role,'' says <PERSON> Ngema </PERSON>. `` We do n't read a lot in the newspaper about what is happening in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. And newspapers outside <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> can not report everything they want to report. So theater at this point in time has become the only voice left.'' <PERSON> Ngema </PERSON> recruited the youngsters from black townships and lived with the entire cast together in one small house for three months. He got permission from their parents to take them 8,000 miles away to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> by promising they would get a good education. He explains that most South African black children do n't attend school because the education they receive is poor and schools are subject to riots and police sweeps. Most Americans probably can not imagine how children raised under crushing oppression could attain Broadway fame and still long to return to their homeland, but the kids do. `` I will go back to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, because it's where I belong, too,'' says <PERSON> Dlamini </PERSON>. `` It's my home. I'll die in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. That's what I think.'' The climactic moment in the film comes when the children meet singer <PERSON> Miriam </PERSON> <PERSON> Makeba </PERSON>, a spiritual leader for them despite her 27 years in exile. They are so overwhelmed by seeing her in person, they cry and cling to her, then break into song. She is moved to tears. `` I may die in exile today, but I will die very happy knowing that you will continue to do all that I started doing,'' <PERSON> Makeba </PERSON> says, `` spreading the message through your music and your lovely voices to the world, telling them and showing them that we are a proud people, and that we are, in fact, a struggling people, and that we will win our independence, and we'll be free like all other people in the world.''

<TEXT>
 After more than 2,000 years, the mystery and magic surrounding the Bible has not abated. Historian-archaeologist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Romer </PERSON> examines the Bible in a seven-part series for the Discovery Channel that attempts to determine what is fact and what is faith. `` Testament: The Bible and History'' begins Wednesday. `` A lot of our knowledge is based on academic structure,'' said <PERSON> Romer </PERSON>, an Englishman who lives in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. `` The trouble is that so many of our assumptions are wrong. `` We've given up our old myths, so now we have an archaeologist telling us about the Bible. A few years ago it would have been a preacher fronting a documentary on the Bible. And 200 years ago you would have been killed if you said the wrong thing.'' Although he looks for a historical foundation, frequently examining biblical sites for evidence, <PERSON> Romer </PERSON> is also quite sympathetic to acceptance on faith alone. `` Now, instead of <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> and Eve, we have social Darwinism,'' he said. `` On the whole, I'd rather have <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> and Eve. It deals with a story and is constructed around issues.'' The first one-hour episode, `` Once Upon a Time,'' airs Wednesday, Friday and Sunday, and is about the origins of the Bible. The second, `` Chronicles and Kings,'' airing Jan. 8, examines the accuracy of the Old Testament as history. The third, `` Mightier Than the Sword,'' is about the Hebrew Bible and the influence of <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> upon the writing of the Old Testament. The fourth show, `` Gospel Truth?'' airing Jan. 22, looks into the historical existence of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>. `` There is no written evidence from his own lifetime that <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> ever existed,'' <PERSON> Romer </PERSON> said. `` I think the most powerful indication of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> is the church itself. Within a short period of time after his death the church was established. That's indication of an incredible energy.'' The fifth episode, `` Thine is the Kingdom,'' airing Jan. 29, is about how the Roman Empire was converted to Christianity. The sixth, `` Power & amp; Glory,'' airing Feb. 5, looks into how Christianity and the Bible survived the Dark Ages. And the final show, `` Paradise Lost,'' airing Feb. 12, examines what has happened to the Bible in the last few hundred years. `` The program is not only about the Bible but what is historically true,'' said <PERSON> Romer </PERSON>. `` It's virtually impossible to prove something did n't happen. You ca n't prove that <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> and Eve did n't exist. History is a series of experiences. Everyone sees something different. `` The way this great book has been treated by kings and princes is a gruesome tale. But what it does give us is absolutely astonishing. The Book of Genesis contains some of the oldest stories in the world. But in the last hundred or so years the Bible has become a civic and scientific guide to the universe and man's society The way a lot of vicars use the Bible they could just as well use the <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grimm </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Romer </PERSON> has written books on ancient <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and the Bible and has written other documentary series on <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. He directed the excavation of the Tomb of Pharaoh Ramses XI in 1977-79, and in 1979 co-founded the Theban Foundation of <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, an organization dedicated to conservation of the Royal Tombs of <LOCATION> Thebes </LOCATION>. He has also worked on numerous archaeological expeditions for the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Romer </PERSON> lives in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> but also has a home in the Valley of the <ORGANIZATION> Kings </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. `` I've spent most of my adult life in two very religious countries,'' he said. `` It's made a great impression on me, especially the Muslims. But the Christian peasants have also educated me. I think it's very important that if you're studying an ancient world that you live in a place like that. I do n't know how young students studying ancient <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> can understand it living in a modern country.'' <PERSON> Romer </PERSON> said he first got into making television films as a means of fund-raising. He said he was astonished how little people care about the past. Television became a way of showing contributors where the money was going and to explain complicated things. `` Television is the greatest selling medium ever devised,'' he said. `` I do n't think you can educate people in the classic sense, but you can get them interested in investigating more. I want people to have a care for old things. I want them to treat the past in a more respectful way.''

 In the summer of 1964, 1,000 young volunteers from mainstream <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> arrived in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> to help register black voters. They were idealistic and committed, believing their enthusiasm and good intentions could make a difference. But it was a time when <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>'s `` dream'' had not yet stemmed the hate and violence of segregation: During that season of the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> Summer Project there were 1,000 arrests, 30 bombings, 35 churches burned, 80 people beaten and at least six murders.

This was the intention of screenwriter <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerolmo </PERSON> who thought the case was a `` good story'' that would be interesting to tell from the perspective of the investigators. `` I never understood this to be <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>'s ` civil rights' picture,'' he said `` It's an exciting story about something important. `` You see our moral failures and greatness. It allows us to see <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> at its very worst and also to see people who displayed great moral courage. That's a real story.'' However, what emerges on the screen is more a detective story than a portrait of a great struggle, and that has some critics and civil rights workers miffed. The heroes are not those who at times sacrificed their lives or well-being to ensure black civil rights, but the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. `` It was unfortunate that it was so narrow in scope that it did not show one black role model that today's youth who look at the movie could remember,'' said <PERSON> Myrlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Evers </PERSON>, commissioner of <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, whose husband, <PERSON> Medgar </PERSON>, a field secretary for the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION>, was shot to death by white segregationists outside their home in 1963. `` In the state of <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, not one leader was mentioned _ not Rev. -LRB- <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> -RRB- </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, who gave his life so that people could register and vote, ... no -LRB- activist -RRB- <PERSON> Fannie </PERSON> <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamer </PERSON>. Certainly no <PERSON> Medgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Evers </PERSON>, who was the pioneer, the motivator of the civil rights movement in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>.'' She also took issue with <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>'s portrayal of the agents as compassionate -LRB- <PERSON> Dafoe </PERSON> marches with mourners at <PERSON> Chaney </PERSON>'s funeral -RRB-. `` I do n't remember the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents we came in contact with as being concerned with the health and welfare of the blacks,'' <PERSON> Evers </PERSON> said. `` We were more or less harassed by them.'' And she challenged the filmmakers' treatment of blacks: `` The fear that you saw in the expression of the actors who played the roles of blacks was certainly accurate during that time, but to simply show fear and no courage is very, very sad.'' <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, a white Southerner who worked in the Summer Project and knew the slain volunteers, talks about the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> in her book, `` Freedom Song,'' published last year by <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrow </PERSON> and Co.: `` Practically everyone working in the civil rights movement knew from firsthand experience of the duplicity of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. In many instances, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents could be seen watching a demonstration while fraternizing with sheriffs and local law officers. ... It has now become commonly accepted that some of these agents were themselves members of the <ORGANIZATION> Ku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION>.'' Despite her misgivings, <PERSON> Evers </PERSON> said `` Mississippi Burning'' -LRB- the name of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> file on the case -RRB- was nevertheless a powerful film. `` The beatings, the lynchings, the burnings, I remember them,'' she said. `` There was a flood of remembering; I could almost reach out and touch the screen and feel the pain. But my pain was doublefold _ not only what I saw on the screen ... but also the neglect in telling the entire story.'' The film could be a contender in the upcoming Academy Award race, and has already won awards from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> for best director, best actor -LRB- <PERSON> Hackman </PERSON> -RRB- and best supporting actress -LRB- <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> <PERSON> McDormand </PERSON> -RRB-. It takes place in 1964, the year President <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> signed the Civil Rights Act, and when <PERSON> King </PERSON> won the Nobel Prize for Peace. It also was one of the most racially violent years of the decade with riots, beatings, bombings and murders. The date is June 21: <PERSON> Chaney </PERSON>, <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Schwerner </PERSON> are stopped by a group of white police and civilians while driving to <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, to investigate the burning of a black church and some beatings. The whites are openly hostile; one sticks a gun in the driver's ear and pulls the trigger. The trio had gone to <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> where only 5 percent of the black population, which made up 45 percent of the state, was registered to vote. A few days after they failed to check in with the project, as they were required to do when in the field, <PERSON> Schwerner </PERSON>'s charred station wagon was discovered in <LOCATION> Bogue </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chitto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>, 15 miles north of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. Their bodies were found in a crude grave on a nearby farm on Aug. 4. The three had been shot, and <PERSON> Chaney </PERSON>'s skull had been fractured from a severe beating. In December, 21 whites were arrested. Murder charges were dropped in state court, but six were later convicted in federal court for violating civil rights laws. <PERSON> Gerolmo </PERSON> interpreted some of the story himself. For instance, the identity of the person who tipped off the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> about where the bodies were buried remains unknown. In the movie, though, the informant turns out to be the deputy sheriff's wife -LRB- McDormand -RRB-. <PERSON> Gerolmo </PERSON> considered it a logical plot twist. `` The wives were often a source of information,'' he said. <PERSON> Gerolmo </PERSON> is the son of <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Gero </PERSON>, a theater manager and producer. His brother, sculptor <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Gero </PERSON>, is married to the actress <PERSON> Liza </PERSON> <PERSON> Minnelli </PERSON>. He was born in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and attended <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> where he taught filmmaking before going into off-Broadway theatrical production. His first movie, `` Miles From Home,'' was a box-office bomb. A <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> grade schooler when <PERSON> Chaney </PERSON>, <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Schwerner </PERSON> were killed, the incident greatly affected his way of thinking. `` It was the first time I ever considered that our country could be wrong,'' he said. `` My mother was active in the civil right movement. She marched from <LOCATION> Selma </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION>, and we used to discuss it around the house.'' With `` Mississippi Burning,'' he hoped to depict American life in general. Filmmakers <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> and <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Capra </PERSON> were his inspirations. `` <PERSON> Capra </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, they took on the task to say what <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is,'' <PERSON> Gerolmo </PERSON> said. `` It has something to do with taking responsibility.''

 The once-hallowed Wall Street tradition of investing in growth stocks has fallen on very hard times of late. The crash of 1987 had something to do with that. But as statistical measures show, the big market break only accelerated a trend that has been in motion for at least five, and maybe as much as 15, years. All this is documented by the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Kidder </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which publishes a monthly compilation of what it calls the `` Top 50'' _ the 50 issues traded on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> that carry the highest price-earnings ratios. As you might expect, this list is typically dominated by companies with strong growth records: for example, <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Walt </PERSON> <PERSON> Disney </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Merck </PERSON> and <PERSON> Eli </PERSON> <PERSON> Lilly </PERSON> in pharmaceuticals, as well as smaller entities like J.M. <ORGANIZATION> Smucker </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Tootsie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roll </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>. Logically, stocks of companies that demonstrate the ability to produce above-average growth should sell at higher P-Es than those with more modest prospects. And they do. But the difference between the median P-E of <ORGANIZATION> Kidder </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Top </ORGANIZATION> 50 and that of the market as a whole, represented by <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500-stock composite index, has lately contracted to the smallest premium it has ever shown in calculations dating back to 1960 In the 1960s and early 1970s, the Top 50's P-E sometimes was more than three times that of the general market. As recently as 1983, the premium stood at 2.5 times. In November it fell to 1.3 times the market multiple. In effect, extra growth is being offered in the marketplace at almost no extra charge. What brought about this devaluation? It started in the'70s with the collapse of a style of investing that focused on what were called `` one-decision'' stocks. Under this philosophy, money managers at investing institutions bought stocks of glamour growth companies with the presumed intention of owning them forever. It did n't matter very much how dearly you paid for these stocks, since you were never going to sell them. Then the recession and bear market of 1973-74 knocked down that notion with a resounding thud. More recently, says <ORGANIZATION> Kidder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> analyst <PERSON> Evelyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Feit </PERSON>, several forces have combined to compress the Top 50's premium _ among them the takeover and buyout binge. `` Investors' attention has been focused on immediate rewards reaped through buyouts, restructurings and such, rather than on the long-term investment potential of growth stocks,'' she observes. `` This has been accompanied by a diminution of confidence in growth projects.'' Tax reform also did growth stocks no favor by eliminating the special tax break for long-term capital gains. Capital gains are the prime allure of these stocks, since fast-growing companies usually pay modest -LRB- or no -RRB- dividends. Now that all investment income is taxed at the same rates, the fashion has shifted markedly to a `` total return'' approach. That left growth stocks more vulnerable than before to competition from low-risk, interest-bearing investments, especially when the rates those investments pay get as high as they have been lately. Since the change in the tax rules was a one-time event, Ms. <PERSON> Feit </PERSON> suggests, the blow it dealt to growth stocks was `` probably a one-time adjustment.'' The way she sees it, all this may represent an opportunity for bargain-conscious investors who believe growth wo n't stay out of vogue forever in the investment world. `` The growth sector appears positioned to show improved relative performance,'' she contends, `` perhaps as early as 1989 if past patterns are repeated.''

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In the manner of `` Casablanca,'' the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> miniseries `` Twist of Fate'' was filmed with different endings. `` The story was very cleverly orchestrated so that it could be cut three different ways,'' said <PERSON> Veronica </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamel </PERSON>, formerly of `` Hill Street Blues,'' who stars in the international thriller. `` I'm happy with the choice they made, because it was my choice. It's good that people can creatively agree and pull their resources together. I felt very good working on this, which is not always the case.'' <PERSON> Hamel </PERSON> stars with <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Cross </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenwood </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glover </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> in this story told against the background of World War II, the Holocaust and the founding of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The four-hour miniseries, which airs Sunday and Monday, is based on the novel `` Pursuit'' by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fish </PERSON>. `` It's a good yarn with a lot of twists,'' said <PERSON> Hamel </PERSON>. `` It's not just about the Holocaust. It's about people and relationships.'' The show, as the title indicates, is indeed filled with twists. Briefly, German SS officer Helmet <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Schraeder </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Greenwood </PERSON> -RRB-, fleeing Allied prosecution, has his identity changed through plastic surgery and poses as <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Grossman </PERSON>, a Jew -LRB- now played by Cross -RRB-. Interned in a concentration camp, he is befriended by and gains respect for his fellow prisoners. Eventually he becomes a founding father of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Greenwood </PERSON> returns later in the miniseries in a dual role as <PERSON> Ben </PERSON>'s grown son who discovers the awful truth about his father and tries to bring him to justice Meanwhile, former <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> colleagues learn the father's secret and attempt to blackmail him into helping with their terrorist scheme. <PERSON> Hamel </PERSON> plays <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON>, the Jewish woman <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> marries. `` As soon as I read the script I liked the feel and texture,'' said <PERSON> Hamel </PERSON>. `` I wanted to climb into her skin. I liked her passion. She was n't an appendage to a man. She had her own very strong views. `` He meets <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> when he leaves the prison camp and goes to <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Hamel </PERSON>. `` She is completely unaware of his past. She has a philosophy that is a strong as her love. In fact, her philosophy comes first. She becomes a doctor, but she's not as political as <PERSON> Golda </PERSON> <PERSON> Meir </PERSON>. But at the end when I'm old, I look like a cross between <PERSON> Golda </PERSON> <PERSON> Meir </PERSON> and <PERSON> Indira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>. `` I have a lot of padding to make me look thicker. That helps, having all those layers. I have to buy it first, then the audience will buy it. The first time I saw myself on the screen I started to giggle.'' The miniseries was filmed on location in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Hamel </PERSON> got a lot of action playing a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Israeli </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. `` This is probably the closest I'll ever get to playing <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>,'' she said. Working in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, she said, was `` like being catapulted out of your life.'' The two-part miniseries originally was scheduled for December, but <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> decided to hold it until after the holidays. <PERSON> Hamel </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, was a leading model before she turned to acting. She made her stage debut in an off-off-Broadway show, `` The Big Knife.'' After several years in dinner-theater productions, she moved to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> in 1975 and landed guest shots on such shows as `` The Rockford Files,'' `` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>'' and `` Family.'' At one point she was cast in `` Charlie's Angels,'' at the time called `` Harry's Angels.'' She withdrew from the series before it went into production and the role went to <PERSON> Jaclyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hamel </PERSON>, who only recently returned from <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, is now busy with her own projects. `` I'm looking for a writer for a project I will co-produce and star in,'' she said. `` It's a two-hour film for TV, and it's not a pilot. I do n't want to do a series. I've done that. It would be hard to find another as good as ` Hill Street Blues.' You have to sign for seven years and that's a long commitment. It's like a marriage. ` Hill Street' was a class act. `` I want to do some movies. But it takes years to get things off the ground. I have an idea for a feature. I'm looking for a development deal. I spend a lot of time reading scripts and books. It's hard to just sit down and read for enjoyment.'' <PERSON> Hamel </PERSON> devotes part of her time to <ORGANIZATION> Stuart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, a center for sexually abused children. She is on the board of directors. She also has worked for six years with a rape treatment center.

 Like <PERSON> Clint </PERSON> <PERSON> Eastwood </PERSON>'s Dirty <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Callahan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> put a .357 Magnum to <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s head, saying maybe he had one bullet left, maybe he did n't. <PERSON> Drexel </PERSON> decided he did. After a protracted battle fought in the courts, the press and the canyons of Wall Street, the nation's fifth-largest securities firm elected not to risk getting its head blown off. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> decided to settle the biggest securities fraud case in history by paying a record $ 650 million in fines and restitution and pleading guilty to six felonies, reversing its longstanding claims of innocence. The battle had already cost the firm nearly $ 2 billion in attorneys' fees and lost business. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> also agreed to cooperate with <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>'s expanding probes into financial trading abuses spawned largely by the downfall of <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, the convicted speculator who fingered <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> and others more than two years ago. The decision came moments before a deadline set by <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> to <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> following weeks of bluffs, counter-bluffs and leaks to the newspapers that a climax was imminent. Post-mortem accounts of this historic showdown reveal <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s directors he was going to make an announcement at 4 p.m. Wednesday. `` He said, ` It's going to be either an indictment or a settlement. You decide,''' said one source familiar with the final pre-deadline maneuvering, who requested anonymity. `` It was a game of blink, and <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> blinked.'' The biggest weapon in <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>'s arsenal was his threat to subject <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> to the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations act, commonly known as RICO, a widely feared, far-reaching statute originally designed to combat drug runners, gangsters and pimps. If <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> had been indicted under that act, the government could have frozen much of its assets and seized what prosecutors had reason to believe were the firm's ill-gotten gains, before trial, to hold as security. Individuals named in the indictment would have been forced to surrender their earnings during the period of alleged wrongdoing. A trial could have taken months or even years, diverting time, energy and money from a firm that has prided itself on efficiency, aggressiveness and big profits. Moreover, convictions would have exposed <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> to multiple civil lawsuits that could have resulted in many hundreds of millions of dollars in fines, because of the racketeering act's provision for triple damages to victims. A racketeering indictment would have come at the worst possible time for <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>, which has been playing crucial financing roles in nearly every multibillion-dollar takeover of the year, most notably a $ 5 billion bridge loan for <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 24.5 billion acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> executives were known to be anxious to protect their interest in that deal, which could net as much as $ 300 million in fees Only a few weeks before <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> deadline, the prosecutor had demonstrated vividly to the firm just how powerful the racketeering act can be. The small <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> investment partnership <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> liquidated because five of its principals and a former <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> trader had been indicted under the statute in August by a Giuliani-directed grand jury. The majority of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s directors decided not to risk a similar fate and opted instead for a settlement that would label the firm a felon but at least put the investigation behind it for good. In other economic and business news this past week: _ British conglomerate <ORGANIZATION> Grand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> acquired <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 5.68 billion, ending the Minneapolis-based food and restaurant concern's feeble effort to thwart the takeover, largely by relying on its poison-pill shareholder rights defense Grand Met's triumph raised new questions about the effectiveness of poison pills, which have been repeatedly challenged in court. _ Government figures presented more mixed evidence of the economy's health Inflation eased slightly in November, while consumer spending and orders for large durable goods rose. For the third quarter of the year, the broadest measure of economic growth was 2.5 percent, down slightly from an earlier estimate of 2.6 percent. None of the figures pointed decisively to a slowdown or an overheated economy. But there was speculation that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> would move soon to hike interest rates if it viewed inflation as a threat. _ The Big Three automakers said vehicle sales jumped 15.3 percent during the mid-December period, paced by a 35.9 percent leap in <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> car sales The performance reflected a major improvement over the same time a year earlier, when consumers spooked by the October 1987 stock market crash cut back on spending for expensive items.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Wall Streeters will have to wait until after Christmas to learn whether the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> has a `` present'' for the markets in the form of an increase in its discount rate. For several weeks now there has been widespread speculation in the financial world that the central bank would raise the rate, which it sets on loans to private financial institutions. But the discount rate has remained where it stood since last Aug. 9, when the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> increased it from 6 percent to 6.5 percent. During this period, analysts say, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has indeed been taking steps to tighten its credit policy in an effort to stave off a revival of inflation. The central bank has chosen, however, to pursue that policy by more subtle means than a discount rate change _ specifically, by maneuvers creating upward pressure on the federal funds rate. Federal funds are overnight loans between banks. The result has been a rise in all short-term interest rates that are determined by the money markets. So when and if the discount rate is changed, it could well be interpreted on Wall Street as nothing more than a `` catch-up'' move. `` The cutting edge of monetary policy is the federal funds rate,'' said <PERSON> Darwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Beck </PERSON>, an economist at <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, in a bulletin to the firm's clients. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> will raise the discount rate when it suits its purposes. `` When the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> raises the discount rate is less important than what it signifies. `` Will it reflect the end of a firming phase or the beginning of a further tightening? For the answer we will have to wait for the announcement and the justification the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> gives for the hike.'' The hope on Wall Street is that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> will be able at some point in the new year to change gears and start loosening credit conditions. For that to happen, analysts reason, Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> and his fellow policymakers would want to see convincing evidence that economic growth was slowing. And the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> might also hold out for an agreement between President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on substantial measures to reduce the federal budget deficit. The tricky part of slowing the economy and shrinking the budget deficit is to do so without causing a recession. Amid hopes that that mission could be accomplished, the stock market continued its tentative, low-volume yearend rally in the past week. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 18.22 points to 2,168.93. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> composite index gained .90 to 156.06; the <ORGANIZATION> NASDAQ </ORGANIZATION> composite index for the over-the-counter market added 1.54 to 377.34, and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> market value index was up 4.85 at 302.22. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> averaged 140.57 million shares a day, against 144.43 million the week before. If fears of an approaching recession intensify in the months ahead, argues <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Resler </PERSON>, economist at <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, they could actually help prevent one from occurring. `` That could happen,'' he said, `` if worries about the future took some of the exuberance out of current spending so that growth could slow enough to let the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> reverse some of this year's credit-tightening `` Some might judge that scenario as too much to hope for, but the lessons of 1988 seem to suggest it is not. `` The economy has shown itself to be both more resilient and less prone to inflation than most economists believed possible.''

 It was the year they held a presidential election and half the nation's voters decided to stay home. It was the year rescuers decided to free a trio of battered, barnacle-encrusted gray whales trapped in the ice at the top of the world. It was the year an early decision to let <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> burn altered the face of the showcase national park for a century to come. It was the year <PERSON> Oprah </PERSON> decided to diet, Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> decided he wanted to be president, Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> decided to resign, evangelist <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> decided to confess his sins and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Spinks </PERSON> decided to challenge world heavyweight champion <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>. Some decisions worked; others did n't. Soviets and Americans pulled together to free two surviving whales, last seen cruising toward warmer waters. Soviet President <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON> bowed out, and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> took over. <PERSON> Oprah </PERSON> <PERSON> Winfrey </PERSON>, the TV host, lost 67 pounds. In <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>, however, officials realized too late they might have made the wrong decision. By the time firefighters arrived, unusually dry weather and high winds had fires ripping out of control, forcing evacuation of towns and causing an uproar among area residents. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> preached on but lost much of his audience after the Assemblies of God decided to defrock him. <PERSON> Spinks </PERSON> lasted for just 91 seconds and eight decisive blows. The wisdom of other decisions remained to be seen. Faced with the choice between Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, and frustrated by one of the most low-down, dirty presidential campaigns ever, an ambivalent electorate waffled and fidgeted and finally succumbed to overwhelming inertia. `` I've always loved election years,'' President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, but it seemed hardly anyone else did. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s 54-46 percent victory over his <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> opponent was based on a 50 percent voter turnout, the lowest in 64 years. Political analysts looked at exit polls and determined that many voters were n't voting for anyone so much as they were voting against the other guy. They also determined that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> lost 2 percent of his supporters because they were turned off by his first major decision _ to tap as his running mate <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, the first `` baby boomer'' on a national ticket and a choice that surprised even <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s advisers. It was Democratic vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, the silver-haired, smooth-talking senator from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, who provided the only memorable line from the three nationally televised debates. `` Senator, you are no <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> told a flustered <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, after the 41-year-old senator had compared himself with the late Democratic president. The Kennedy image haunted the campaign and the nation. The 25th anniversary of his assassination became a time to reflect on idealism lost and a world changed. Nowhere was that change more apparent than in U.S.-Soviet relations. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, on the campaign trail himself 28 years ago, shunned <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> when he visited <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, the first Soviet leader since <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> to taste the Big Apple, had a super-power lunch with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Dec. 7 and addressed the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, with no Khrushchev-style shoe-thumping. Instead, he promised to trim 500,000 men and 10,000 tanks from the Soviet armed forces. The visit ended abruptly when a devastating earthquake hit Soviet <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. The Soviet leader rushed home to learn that an estimated 60,000 had died and 500,000 were left homeless as whole cities crumbled under the quake's force. Rescue teams, doctors and planes loaded with supplies poured in from around the world. It was the first time since World War II that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had accepted disaster relief from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> paid his first visit to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in June for a summit that failed to break new ground in arms control. The president hammered away on human rights issues, and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> later sent <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> living proof of his commitment to change. Nobel laureate <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, father of the Soviet dissident movement, was allowed his first trip outside the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> after years of agitation over Soviet human rights policies. Americans vigorously agitated for their own causes. More than 5,000 people were arrested in anti-abortion protests that began in July in 32 cities and continued through the year. <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision legalizing abortion, turned 15 years old, intact. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> McLeod </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, confirmed as a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> justice by a unanimous <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, inherited a pivotal vote on the abortion issue but gave no hint of his views. Court dockets bulged with the celebrated cases of the once-powerful. Former Philippine President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON>, were indicted on racketeering charges alleging they plundered their homeland of millions and defrauded <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks. <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> and <PERSON> Leona </PERSON> <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>, the king and queen of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> real estate, pleaded innocent to dozens of tax evasion charges. Republican <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> became the first governor in a half-century to be impeached and removed from office, although he was acquitted on criminal charges of concealing a $ 350,000 campaign loan. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> and <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> pleaded innocent to charges of defrauding the government by selling arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and giving the proceeds to the Contras at a time when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to the Nicaraguan rebels was banned. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> refused to restore military aid to the Contras but decided to approve humanitarian aid after the Nicaraguan rebels and the Sandinista government reached a temporary truce. In a decision that stunned <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> authorized talks with <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> for the first time in at least 13 years. `` Our object is not a dialogue,'' Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. `` Our object is peace.'' Uneasy peace prevailed in the 8-year-old Iran-Iraq War after a <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nations-sponsored </LOCATION> cease-fire began Aug. 20. Peace talks opened five days later; they were deadlocked within 24 hours. In <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, Soviet troops began a withdrawal in 1988, but the guerrilla war raged on.

<HEAD>Durable Goods Orders Rise; Markets Quiet</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
 The economy is headed into 1989 with healthy growth in orders for `` big ticket'' durable goods, according to a government report. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday that durable goods orders climbed 1.8 percent in November, not counting the erratic defense category. The report had little effect on the financial markets. Including defense orders, total durable goods orders edged up only 0.1 percent in November to a seasonally adjusted $ 122.89 billion. That followed a giant 2.9 percent rise in October. The overall figure was inflated by a big jump in military orders in October and then depressed when military orders returned to more normal levels last month. Discounting the swings in defense, orders in the civilian category climbed 1.8 percent in November, the best showing since a 5.2 percent August increase. Civilin orders had risen only 0.2 percent in October. Analysts said they were impressed by the strength in civilian orders, and said the orders should keep <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plants operating busily through the first half of 1989. `` This was an impressive gain and it should pretty much insure that the economy will keep growing next year,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, head of a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> forecasting firm. Financial markets were quiet Thursday heading into the Christmas holiday. On Wall Street, the stock market posted a modest loss. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 4.28 points to 2,160.36. In the bond market, prices edged up slightly as the yield on the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s benchmark 30-year bond stood at 8.93 percent. The dollar drifted higher against most major currencies in extremely thin trading. It stood at 1.7729 West German marks and 124.68 Japanese yen in late <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> trading. Oil prices continued rising. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the February contract for <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION>, the benchmark grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude, rose 19 cents to $ 16.49 a barrel after rising 15 cents Wednesday.

 A historic plea bargain that would spare <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> from a criminal indictment has incited a mixed reaction among its staff and skepticism by a key <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lawmaker, who suggested the $ 650 million penalty slapped on the Wall Street giant might not go far enough. Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Democrat who chairs a committee with oversight authority in the securities industry, said Thursday he would have to see details of the settlement before drawing conclusions. `` Main Street has less reason to trust Wall Street,'' he said. `` When the details of the settlement come out, we'll find out whether Main Street has reason to trust their government.'' He also said: `` I have no reason to believe that Main Street will be satisifed by anything less than the most serious punishment. Currently the public regards markets as a crap shoot and has been avoiding them like the devil avoids holy water.'' The agreement announced Wednesday would require <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> to plead guilty to six felonies and pay a record $ 650 million in fines and restitution to settle as-yet unspecified charges, most likely stemming from its relationship with <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, the now-imprisoned inside trader who fingered the firm. In addition, it would require <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> to provide investigators with evidence of possible wrongdoing by its high-yield bond financier <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> and others. Although <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> senior executives expressed relief about the settlement and predicted the firm would thrive, sources familiar with internal criticism of the decision said other employees felt embittered and concerned. `` There's not going to be a mass exodus, but I think in time significant people will leave,'' said one of the sources, who spoke on condition they not be identified. `` I think suicide is a little strong, but I think it's like cutting off your arms and legs.'' The plea bargain marked a stunning turnaround for <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>, which had asserted its innocence since being implicated by <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> more than two years ago and had denounced him as a convicted felon and doublecrosser. Others said <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, a key target of the criminal investigation spawned by <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, felt betrayed by the <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> decision, which weakens his own defense. <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> has maintained his innocence and has reiterated that he would fight any indictment. But the sources said that if he were indicted he would terminate his relationship with <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>, which <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> helped grow into one of the most aggressive and profitable firms. At the same time, the agreement took tremendous pressure off chief executive <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> and other senior managers, who had been urging colleagues to swallow their pride and settle the case so the firm could leave the protracted ordeal behind. The agreement also raised the prospect that former White House chief of staff <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, whose <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> law practice has been advising <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> for months, would become chairman as part of a long-term recovery strategy, sources familiar with <ORGANIZATION> Baker-Drexel </ORGANIZATION> discussions said. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, the onetime <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> senator who has been conferring in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> aides almost every other week, was visiting the firm a day before the settlement was reached, the sources said. `` Clearly the decision yesterday -LRB- Wednesday -RRB- removes one of the major obstacles,'' said one source. `` Now you can see the opportunity to talk in more detail about such a role.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s spokesman <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Griscom </PERSON> declined to comment on <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s discussions or speculation about his selection as chairman `` They have continued to talk and we expect that to go forward for the next several weeks,'' <PERSON> Griscom </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Anreder </PERSON> said, `` We echo comments about discussions with him but there's nothing wider on the table.'' The settlement agreement still requires approval from senior <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials and the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which sued <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> and others three months ago on civil charges of conspiring with <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> to profit on inside information, manipulate stock and commit other frauds. Sources familiar with the agreement said these other agencies must approve the agreement by mid-January. <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON> <PERSON> Larson </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, declined to comment on the agreement or on the status of possible discussions with <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Anreder </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s spokesman, also declined to comment on any <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> discussions.

 After settling the nation's biggest securities fraud case, <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> now faces the crucial task of retaining its clients, who include many well-known takeover strategists. The beleaguered Wall Street firm received some staunch support from a number of corporate clients Thursday, one day after it agreeing to plead guilty to six fraud charges and pay the government a record $ 650 million penalty. But some clients said privately they still needed to review whether the plea-bargaining arrangement would change their close business relationship with <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>. `` I do n't think anything at this point is that clear,'' said a spokesman for one client, which did not want to be identified. In announcing its plea agreement late Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> avoided what could have been a lengthy, costly trial that threatened to slowly destroy the firm. The government had spent two years investigating <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s relationship with <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, the former stock speculator was accused of insider trading. Although the $ 650 million settlement is the largest ever in a securities fraud case, <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> said it may have cost more in lost business and legal fees had it continued to fight the federal charges. <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> chief executive officer, said the company already has lost about $ 1.5 billion in business and paid out $ 175 million in legal expenses. The settlement, though, does not protect <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s high-yield `` junk bond'' whiz and another key target of the criminal probe <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> repeatedly has asserted his innocence. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> now faces the formidable task of retaining its key clientele, even without <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, if it hopes to remain one of the most powerful and profitable investment banks on Wall Street. <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> has generated billions of dollars in revenue for <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> through junk bond underwriting, much of which has been used to finance some of the biggest corporate takeovers of the decade. Loyal clients have included such takeover strategists as <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Perelman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Saul </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>. `` It's obviously a serious blow to <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive of Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> Farley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>, which contemplates using Drexel-floated junk bonds to buy <ORGANIZATION> Westpoint-Pepperell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> has assured him it will be able to fulfill its role in the financing He said he was confident the firm could finance the acquisition of Westpoint-Pepperell `` under any scenario you could describe, and that obviously includes without <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>.'' A <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said Thursday that the firm would continue reassuring its clients that the government settlement would not interfere with any of its current or future deals. `` We have a program of ... communication with employees and clients, which we consider to be our principal constituentcies,'' said <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anreder </PERSON>, a senior vice president for the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> firm. `` The people I've spoken to have indicated their support.'' Among the staunch supporters have been such small, growth-oriented companies as <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, real estate developer <ORGANIZATION> Hovnanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` We feel indebted to <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>,'' said Hovnanian President <PERSON> Ara </PERSON> <PERSON> Hovnanian </PERSON>. `` They helped us a great deal with our financing and that's why we'll be standing with them in their difficult times.'' <ORGANIZATION> Hovnanian </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 100 million in junk bonds enabled it grow more than six-fold over the past six year. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Shamrock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which hopes to take over <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> with the help of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> junk-bond financing, said his firm would maintain its relationship with <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>. `` Shamrock is gratified that <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s put the whole thing behind them. It's been a very difficult experience, but it resolves any uncertainties, real or imagined, that may have existed on Wall Street concerning <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s ability to operate,'' <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>, billionaire chairman of Dallas-based <ORGANIZATION> Valhi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, was equally as supportive. <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> said he used <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> to float junk bonds three times, most recently in February when he increased his stake in <ORGANIZATION> NL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>, a company of which he is now chairman. `` I'm sure we'll be doing business with them in the future,'' he said.

<HEAD>Final WPPSS Trial Defendant Settles For $20 Million</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A $ 20 million settlement with the final defendant essentially ends the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supply </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> securities-fraud trial, but the nearly six-year-old case is far from over. The federal judge hearing the case still must decide whether to approve the out-of-court settlements reached by defendants in the class action suit, and then how to divide the roughly $ 750 million among 24,000-plus plaintiffs and attorneys. Plaintiff attorney, <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>, said late Thursday in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> that the settlement pool may not be dispensed until late next year, or even later if disputes arise. The settlement by the final defendant, <ORGANIZATION> Blyth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a financial adviser to <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION>, was announced Thursday. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Browning </PERSON> still must approve 16 separate settlements reached over much of the past year. <PERSON> Browning </PERSON> already has approved four settlements, reached as early as September 1987. The legal action grew from <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION>' 1983 default on $ 2.25 billion in bonds sold to finance two nuclear power plants that were abandoned before completion. The default was the biggest in the history of the municipal bond market. <PERSON> Browning </PERSON> was hearing the securities fraud case in <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, on a change of venue from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state. The more than 100 original defendants have agreed to pay about $ 700 million to settle the case, and another $ 50 million could be collected from contested insurance claims. Plaintiff bondholders had made total claims of $ 1.6 billion. The trial, which started Sept. 7, had been expected to take up to a year. <PERSON> Browning </PERSON> now is expected to dismiss the jurors, who recessed Dec. 1. In addition to approving the settlements, <PERSON> Browning </PERSON> must decide how to divide the money among several classes of plaintiffs and among dozens of attorneys. Attorneys said they hoped to get the notice of settlements to the class of plaintiffs by Jan. 16, and to get approval for all of them in a March hearing. Distribution of the money will be determined after <PERSON> Browning </PERSON> holds fairness hearings, presumably in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. If all the money is in hand and there are no challenges, the award can be sent to plaintiffs all at once, said <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>. `` We hope that can be done by the end of 1989,'' he said. Some money still could be distributed if there is a dispute, with the court withholding disputed funds. Defendants in the federal lawsuit, which incorporated dozens of separate suits dating to Feb. 22, 1983, included the supply system, the 88 utilities that contracted with <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> to build the two plants, engineering firms, Wall Street bond underwriters, utility and <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> directors and <PERSON> Blyth </PERSON> <PERSON> Eastman </PERSON>. The default was on bonds <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> sold to finance construction starting in the late 1970s on its plants No. 4, at the <LOCATION> Hanford </LOCATION> nuclear reservation, and No. 5, at Satsop, west of <LOCATION> Olympia </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> abandoned the plants in 1982 because of rising construction costs and doubts about the need for the plants' power. Default occurred in July 1983 after the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled that utilities participating in construction of the plants lacked authority to sign contracts with <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> guaranteeing payment even if no electricity was generated. There there has been little complaint about most of the settlements, but a proposal by the state of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to pay $ 10 million to settle any claims that might be brought against it has been criticized by plaintiffs in a state court lawsuit. Those plaintiffs claim the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state auditor failed to audit the supply system and to examine bond resolutions prior to bond sales, thus failing to protect investors. Plaintiffs are seeking the return of their full $ 2.25 billion investment, plus interest they would have received over the 30-year life of the bonds, a claim that could total $ 7 billion.

 <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s historic plea-bargain deal with federal prosecutors has had little effect on the financial markets. News of the settlement of fraud charges caused nary a ripple Thursday even in <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s own backyard, the market for high-risk, high-yield `` junk bonds,'' which the investment firm pioneered. Conventional bonds as well as stocks also failed to register a reaction. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 4.28 points to 2,160.36 Thursday. A `` flight to quality'' out of junk bonds and into conventional securities, which had been predicted in some quarters as a result of the <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> debacle, failed to materialize. <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>, corporate and municipal bonds had an uneventful trading day, finishing mixed. The yield on the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s closely watched 30-year bond slipped to 8.93 percent from 8.94 percent late Wednesday. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> announced late Wednesday, after the markets closed, that <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> had reversed itself by agreeing to admit guilt to six felonies and pay a record $ 650 million fine to settle the biggest securities fraud case in history. Expectations of a <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> settlement had grown in recent days, and the markets were n't taken by surprise. In fact, they seemed relieved that the business was over with and <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> had decided not to wage a risky fight. `` This one's been hanging around for some time,'' said <PERSON> Monte </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, director of research at <ORGANIZATION> Dreyfus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. All the markets were quiet, at any rate, as trading slowed in anticipation of the Christmas and New Year's holidays `` The only surprise is that -LRB- the <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> settlement -RRB- happened on Wednesday,'' said <PERSON> Micheal </PERSON> <PERSON> Metz </PERSON>, a stock market analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Oppenheimer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` At least for the moment, <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> is still in the arena and functioning.'' Wall Street had already shown some support Wednesday for an anticipated settlement, by lifting share prices of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and a few other takeover-related companies. Junk bonds are widely used to finance debt-financed takeovers of companies. The takeover stocks have been buoying the otherwise lackluster market in recent weeks. Without the boost provided by those stocks, `` we've got no performance at all, period,'' said <PERSON> Oppenheimer </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Metz </PERSON>.

 Nearly a continent away from Wall Street but dead center in its latest insider-trading scandal, junk bond king <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> works on an opulent avenue lined with tony boutiques and stately hotels. The decision of his employer, <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, to pay a record $ 650 million fine to settle criminal securities fraud charges has reportedly split the company's ranks over the fate of <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>. But there was little outward sign of that turmoil Thursday. Employees arriving for work _ the few who would acknowledge a reporter _ refused to talk about the case. Attempts to get into <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s unobtrusive offices were rebuffed by uniformed guards who staff the reception desk of the building on Rodeo Drive, the shoppers' Mecca. <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> has said through spokesmen that he is prepared to fight criminal charges believed pending against him. According to some who saw him socially during the many months the <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> investigation has been publicly unwinding, <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> appears to have retained his customary enthusiasm for business and extensive charitable interests. `` He's not a defensive-type guy,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Riordan </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> attorney and investor and friend of <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>'s who last saw him 10 days ago at a charity event. `` He acts like nothing has happened and his whole time and effort is spent on the thing at hand,'' <PERSON> Riordan </PERSON> said. `` My guess is he's a tough guy ... I think he's going to keep doing business as usual.'' The very fact of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s presence in this enclave of the rich and famous is testament to <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>'s importance to <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>, and his willingness to flout convention. Not only is <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> out of <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, it's a good 10 miles from the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> financial district. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s offices are spread through two low-rise gray marble buildings that also house the aristocratic <PERSON> Gump </PERSON>'s department store, a clothing boutique and a savings and loan office. Across Rodeo Drive is the ornate <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wilshire </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hotel </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> stays when she's in town. Up the way are shops of <ORGANIZATION> Cartier </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Tiffany </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Van </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cleef </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Arpels jewelers, where President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> bought the first couple's wedding ring. Inside the office, <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> and his lieutenants line up buyers and sellers of high-risk, high-yield junk bonds. Much of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s junk bond business depends on this network, with previous issuers of bonds often being tapped to buy someone else's new issue. <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> is said to have tired of working in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and to have persuaded <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> that the business could be done by telephone from anywhere.

 The central bank lowered <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>'s most important interest rate Friday following last week's rate increases. The <ORGANIZATION> Banque </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Belgique </ORGANIZATION> cut the rate on three-month treasury certificates to 7.5 percent from 7.65 percent. It also cut the rate for one - and two-month certificates to 7.4 percent from 7.5 percent Last week's rate increases had been part of a concerted round decided by a number of European central banks. A central bank official said the stability of the foreign exchange markets and the strength of the Belgian economy and trade balances had allowed the bank to lower the three-month rate. `` It is the policy of the bank to keep rates as low as possible and the international environment allowed this,'' said the official, who asked not to be named. <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> raised its rates through much of last summer and lowered them in a series of small steps this past fall in line with international trends. Last week the downtrend came to an abrupt halt when the central bank saw itself forced to act in concert with other central banks to nip budding inflation with rate increases.

 <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Instruments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Hitachi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> have agreed to jointly develop technology for a new generation of computer memory chips, <ORGANIZATION> Hitachi </ORGANIZATION> officials said.

<HEAD>Environmentalists Worry About Plan To Restart Offshore Exploration</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The federal government is dusting off its plans for offshore gas and oil exploration, much to the dismay of environmentalists who are gearing up for another standoff along the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>. Ocean pollution incidents in the past two years have created a hypersensitive environment for officials in the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION>, which hopes to renew drilling activity in the next several years on the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. `` The ecosystem is certainly as stressed as it can possibly be without being in serious jeopardy from offshore drilling,'' said <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Zipf </PERSON>, coordinator of <ORGANIZATION> Clean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ocean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION>, a coalition of more than 100 environmental groups based in <LOCATION> Sandy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hook </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Millemann </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, a Washington-based national coalition of environmental activists, reacted in like fashion. `` My heavens, what do we have left to wash up?'' she said. `` About the only thing we do n't have washing up yet is oil. Perhaps they want to make it a full banquet of human waste.'' Last year, the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> published an inquiry in the Federal Register to assess industry interest in again leasing and exploring the offshore area. The proposed mid-Atlantic sale area extends from <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> south to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, covering more than 71 million acres. It is not the first attempt to explore the region. Between 1976 and 1983, 32 exploratory wells were drilled in the <LOCATION> mid-Atlantic </LOCATION> region. Only five produced hydrocarbons, indicating oil or gas, but none in sufficient amounts to make it worth the investment in bringing it ashore. Still, several oil companies have expressed an interest in more exploration. The <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is working on an environmental impact statement, due to be completed early next year, said <PERSON> Marcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Heimberger </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the department. The eventual step would be to lease tracts again so interested companies could drill more exploratory wells, she said. In the meantime, concerned citizens should `` make sure _ right now _ that their governor and congressional representatives take a very firm stand against this, because the only thing the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> responds to is political pressure,'' said <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Chasis </PERSON>, a senior attorney with the <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Already, several lawmakers have opposed the leasing plan. When <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, found out about the renewed lease program last year, he immediately called for revisions. He said the new five-year program is too heavily weighted toward drilling in environmentally sensitive areas, and does not provide sufficient protections for marine and coastal resources. This month, Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Courter </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.J. </LOCATION>, said he would ask <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to place a 10-year moratorium on oil and gas exploration off the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> shore. In the first attempt to drill for oil off the <LOCATION> mid-Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> states </LOCATION>, consortiums that included giants such as <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION>, Sun and <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> capped their wells after spending billions of dollars on one too many dry holes. So why would the federal government _ and the oil companies _ want to try to lease such tracts again? `` The most important reason is national security,'' Ms. <PERSON> Heimberger </PERSON> said. `` We're all seeing stories about <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> trying to withhold production. It's an energy security issue for us, particularly in the northern <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> states, one of the largest users and importers of natural gas.'' In addition, `` Even though the fields were n't commercially producable 10 years ago, there have been a lot of technological improvements,'' she said. `` It has changed by leaps and bounds, actually. Companies are now able to work in much deeper water.'' That could be the difference this time, according to <ORGANIZATION> Rutgers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> geology professor <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Manspeizer </PERSON>. `` The target area in 1976 was a different sequence of rocks. They did n't go down deep enough last time,'' he said. The real gamblers in the venture will ultimately be those who pay for the right to explore again for oil and gas. `` But that's the nature of the business,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lastelic </PERSON>, spokesman for the Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. `` If you quit because of a few dry holes, you may be leaving a treasure behind.'' Oil companies are also aware of the need to increase <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> production, he said. `` We're now importing 42 percent of what we use,'' <PERSON> Lastelic </PERSON> said. `` Our production continues to go down and consumption goes up.'' Both the federal government and the oil companies realistically expect opposition, however. Ms. <PERSON> Zipf </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Millemann </PERSON>, for instance, questioned why the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is not working to find other energy sources, and why the federal government relaxed restrictions on vehicles that burn a lot of gasoline. `` There's much more we could be doing to conserve rather than looking for potential new sources,'' Ms. <PERSON> Zipf </PERSON> said. She pointed to some of the potential dangers from offshore drilling, including oil spills and dredge remains. Ms. <PERSON> Millemann </PERSON> said that recent ocean pollution incidents have proven that currents pull pollutants toward shore or into prime fishing grounds. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> estimates they collect 10 percent or less of oil from a spill,'' she said. <PERSON> Lastelic </PERSON>, in turn, explained that the last industry oil spill occurred almost 20 years ago, `` and in that interim, we've made great technological progress in drilling, and we now have a whole set of environmental laws and inspections.'' Although he acknowledged that drilling may sometimes stir up the ocean bottom close to the platform, `` no one has been able to conclude that it drifts far away. ... No one has been able to show these muds have done any damage to fish.'' In reality, the platforms usually attract schools of fish because microscopic life clings to the bottom, <PERSON> Lastelic </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Millemann </PERSON> vehemently disagreed that oil drilling hardly affects the waters. `` The process of extracting oil from underwater creates huge quantities of pollutants,'' she said. `` Lubricating oils are needed to keep the bit going into the ground, and they usually use diesel oil, even though the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> has wanted them to use mineral oil.''

<HEAD>Lucky Charms, Occult Goods A Serious Business</HEAD>

 Whether they come in the form of occult goods aimed at teen-agers or as amulets sold at mainstream shrines and temples, lucky charms are a staple of Japanese life _ and a profitable business. Each year tens of millions of Japanese adults flock to Shinto shrines and <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> temples to buy charms said to bring luck or ward off nearly any kind of calamity imaginable. During the three-day New Year's holiday alone, priests at the <LOCATION> Tsurugaoka </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hachiman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shrine </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Kamakura </LOCATION>, southwest of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, expect to sell 300,000 lucky arrows, according to <PERSON> Atsushi </PERSON> <PERSON> Takahashi </PERSON>, a shrine spokesman. `` The New Year's holidays are our busiest season, and we expect nearly 2 million people to visit,'' <PERSON> Takahashi </PERSON> said. If all the lucky arrows are sold, at 800 and 2,000 yen -LRB- $ 6 and $ 16 -RRB- each, the Shinto shrine will take in over $ 2 million. And arrows are just one of nearly a dozen charms sold at the shrine. Money made from sales of amulets is considered a contribution, and the shrines and temples pay no tax on the income. `` Sales of charms are what keep many shrines in the black,'' said a priestess at another <LOCATION> Kamakura </LOCATION> shrine. `` But sometimes I wonder whether people who buy the amulets are n't missing the real point, which is faith in the divine,'' she said, requesting anonymity. Tourist maps are sold at the <LOCATION> Kamakura </LOCATION> train station which show the location of major temples and list each one's divine favors _ including business prosperity, improved eyesight and even the prevention of cancer. Most of the charms are colorful, pocket-sized pouches which contain a talisman or drawing of a deity. `` The popularity of amulets may be due to the abundance of money in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and people's desire for material things,'' said the business director of Kiyomizu-dera, a major <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> temple in <LOCATION> Kyoto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s ancient capital. `` But we do n't consider that as necessarily bad,'' he said, identifying himself only as <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoki </PERSON>. `` The point is that if they did n't have any faith at all, they would n't come here in the first place.'' <PERSON> Kazushi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sano </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shinto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shrines </ORGANIZATION>, which supervises the nation's 80,000 shrines, said there are no written rules regarding amulets, but added his organization discourages their sale in department stores or other commercial outlets. `` That would be rude to the gods,'' <PERSON> Sano </PERSON> said. `` It's hard to judge whether the amulets are effective,'' he said, `` because they involve divine powers that people ca n't always understand.'' Charms and the principle behind them, `` genze goriaku'' or benefit in this world, can be traced back for centuries. They are an integral part of Japanese religious faith. Most Japanese at times worship in both Shinto and <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> settings, often holding weddings at Shinto shrines and funerals at <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> temples. Having charms from both faiths at one's home is common. But a recent increase in sales of occult amulets to junior and senior high school girls has raised eyebrows in the mass media. `` We've been flooded by reporters in the past year,'' said <PERSON> Kazuo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arai </PERSON>, an employee of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>'s `` Little Witch House.'' Though not affiliated with either the <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> or Shinto faith, the shop draws a steady flow of schoolgirls with nearly 200 kinds of charms supposed to improve one's popularity or love life. `` Little Witch House'' itself is small, but is run by a company which publishes `` My Birthday,'' a monthly teen magazine with a circulation of roughly 400,000 nationwide. Much of the magazine is devoted to explanations of fortune-telling, charms and incantations, <PERSON> Arai </PERSON> said. `` The girls come here seeking help with problems they face in their day-to-day lives,'' he said. `` They're young, inexperienced and look to the charms to help them in situations they do n't know how to handle.'' `` What the girls are doing is basically the same as what adults do when they buy charms at shrines,'' <PERSON> Arai </PERSON> said, adding that they may be imitating their parents, who can often be found at shrines during the examination season buying amulets said to help students pass. Most of the charms _ pendants, rings and brooches _ sell for less than $ 10. `` They do n't seem to be very serious about the charms' effects,'' he said, `` and I think they are finding a good balance'' between reality and fantasy. <PERSON> Arai </PERSON> said visitors are told `` some problems ca n't be solved by magic,'' and employees offer a sympathetic ear to girls who may just need to talk about their troubles.

 Grain and soybean futures opened mixed, then turned slightly lower today in light, pre-Christmas trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Arbitration On The Rise As Doubts About Litigation Grow</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Business Analyst John Cunniff is on vacation.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Litigation will always be the bedrock of the American judicial system, but many businesses are deciding it's not for them. More and more, companies that ca n't resolve their differences by negtiation are submitting them to impartial arbitrators who weigh both sides and hand down binding decisions. Commercial arbitration cases rose 84 percent from 1983 to last year and are still increasing, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arbitration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> says. Arbitration makes sense in many situations. It saves time and money and puts complex matters in the hands of trained experts instead of untrained, unpredictable judges or juries. `` The idea of asking 12 uneducated, uninformed jurors to try to decide an issue that is complex and requires technical training and experience in an industry _ it just does n't make sense,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Coulson </PERSON>, president of the arbitration association. In arbitration, <PERSON> Coulson </PERSON> said, `` You can pick an arbitrator who's expert on the industry, or patent law, or whatever aspect of technical information that is relevant to the case. Arbitration gained credibility when computer rivals <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Fujitsu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> used it to end a bitter dispute over <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s copyrights on mainframe computer software. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> has a glorious history of victories in the legal system, so some analysts said it was foolish of the company to surrender so much control over its future to a law professor and a retired railroad executive whose judgments are impossible to appeal. But choosing arbitration probably shaved tens or hundreds of millions of dollars from <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s _ and <ORGANIZATION> Fujitsu </ORGANIZATION>'s _ legal fees while removing crippling uncertainty over the terms of their competition. Even patent lawyers like the trend, mainly because they are so overworked they do n't mind the competition from arbitrators. Juries simply ca n't grasp many patent issues, said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Blommer </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intellectual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Property </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` When the Constitution was written, there were n't cases like this where the average man could n't understand the facts,'' <PERSON> Blommer </PERSON> said. That was before the days of biotechnology and microelectronics. In a complex patent case today, <PERSON> Blommer </PERSON> said, `` If under cross-examination somebody is forced to recant or change his position, the jury might not understand that he even is changing his position.'' Federal judges do a little better, but not many of them studied science or engineering, either. The judiciary took a step in the right direction in 1982 by sending all patent appeals to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, where many judges are highly trained and have expert clerks. Actually, most arbitration is on matters other than intellectual property disputes. Labor grievances account for about a third of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arbitration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>'s business. Other big areas are construction contracts, disputes between stockbrokers and clients, insurance claims and supervision of elections of private organizations. Many contracts are being written to include provisions that any disputes over them will be submitted to arbitration. Non-binding arbitration, where decisions can be appealed to the courts, is also growing in popularity. The Better Business Bureau does it. So does the insurance industry. Courts in 20 to 25 states and 10 federal districts have annexes that do arbitration to clear out cases that do n't need to go before a judge or jury. Trials, particularly trials by juries, clearly have a place. Criminal cases are obviously not suited to arbitration. Arbitrators are also unsuited to try cases where major societal questions are at stake, such as the round of lawsuits against cigarette companies over health damage from smoking. Even in areas where arbitration is well-suited, there is a cost in civil liberties. The state of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, in a first, is trying to prohibit stockbrokers from requiring that their clients agree ahead of time to settle disputes by arbitration. A federal judge last week threw out <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>' regulatory effort, but the state vowed to appeal. `` Compulsory arbitration or arbitration agreements entered into by citizens who do not recognize they are forfeiting their constitutional right to trial by jury is counter to the American system of fair play,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lawyers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> said. Americans have not lost their taste for suing the living daylights out of each other. Clearly, though, arbitration has plenty of room to grow. `` It's exciting to let people take control of their own disputes and use their innovation and ideas to resolve them in a practical way,'' <PERSON> Coulson </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Dallas Investor Simmons to Boost Stake in Aerospace Firm</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CALABASAS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said today it had buttressed its takeover defenses following the disclosure that <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> investor <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> intended to boost his holdings in the aerospace firm. <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Slayman </PERSON> refused to say if the changes in a 2-year-old `` poison pill'' shareholder rights plan were a direct response to <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>' move. Nor would he reveal if <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION>, builder of the Stealth fighter and other military hardware, had discussed the investment with <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>. <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> did not immediately respond to a telephone request for comment. According to <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>' <ORGANIZATION> Valhi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> filed notice under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act that he intended to boost his <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> stake beyond $ 15 million, the trigger point for the act's disclosure provisions. As of the Dec. 7 filing, <ORGANIZATION> Valhi </ORGANIZATION> said it owned 375,000 of <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION>'s 59.5 million outstanding shares, or 0.63 percent. A <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> board vote to tighten the firm's takeover defenses was taken Thursday, two weeks after the filing, <PERSON> Slayman </PERSON> said. `` The amendment is intended to heighten the protection afforded shareholders against abusive takeover tactics,'' the company said in a news release. The revised plan allows present shareholders to buy newly issued stock at a discount if an outsider buys 20 percent or more of the common stock. Those rights can be canceled if the independent directors determine the takeover bid is in the best interest of shareholders, or if the company cancels the rights within 10 days of the time outside holdings reach 20 percent. Such poison pill plans are intended to dilute the holdings of a potential buyer, making a takeover prohibitively expensive. <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION>, with headquarters in this <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> suburb, has 88,000 employees in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. The nation's fourth-largest defense contractor, <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> had sales of $ 11.3 billion in 1987. In the first three quarters of this year, it reported a net profit of $ 520 million on sales of $ 7.6 billion, with the profit figure boosted significantly by sale of a subsidiary. Besides the F-117A Stealth fighter, its proojects include the Trident II nuclear missile, the C-5B transport plane and work on military communications, satellites, and the Strategic Defense Initiative or Star Wars. The company also is a subcontractor for design work on <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s space station project.

<HEAD>Cup Of Coffee Will Soon Cost More</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Get ready to swallow an increase in coffee prices. Poor growing and harvesting conditions have pushed prices for green, unroasted coffee beans to their highest levels in two years, and roasters say they'll pass their higher costs along by raising prices about 30 cents a pound. <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the second-largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> coffee roaster behind <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>' General Foods division, said Thursday that it would raise wholesale prices of its ground roasted coffees by 30 cents a pound on Jan. 23. P & amp; G, which produces <PERSON> Folger </PERSON>'s coffee, also plans increases of 27 cents a pound for its 11 -LCB- - ounce special-roast flaked coffee and 4 cents an ounce for its instant coffees `` All I can say is that coffee is a fluctuating market,'' said <ORGANIZATION> P </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; G spokeswoman <PERSON> Belinda </PERSON> <PERSON> Baxter </PERSON> <PERSON> Welsh </PERSON> in a telephone interview from her office in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>. `` We try very hard not to increase our prices any more than we have to, but the price of green coffee went up.'' General Foods, maker of <ORGANIZATION> Maxwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> coffee, said it had no one available to discuss coffee prices. But analysts said they expected other roasters to follow P & amp; G's lead. The rise in green coffee prices may filter down even more quickly for those who prefer to buy freshly roasted beans from bins at gourmet coffee shops, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Siefer </PERSON>, manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Coffee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Tea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> boutique. <PERSON> Siefer </PERSON> said he planned to raise prices by 30 cents a pound on Dec. 26. `` It's going to hit the gourmet end of the business a little sooner than it may be reflected in the major coffee companies,'' he said. `` We do n't have quite the capital the major companies have. They buy by the -LRB- 37,500-pound -RRB- container-load, but we generally have less than 2,000 pounds on hand.'' Cash prices for green coffee from <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, the world's largest producer, have soared this month as the seasonal rise in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> consumption focused attention on supply problems ranging from drought conditions in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> to a rain-delayed harvest in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. In just the past two weeks, the price of Brazilian coffee in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> harbor surged to $ 1.45 a pound from $ 1.17 a pound. During the same period, coffee for March delivery on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Coffee, Sugar & amp; <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, leaped from about $ 1.27 a pound to about $ 1.49 a pound. The tight-supply picture eased somewhat late in the past week. A 10-day Brazilian dockworkers' strike ended on Thursday and the 15-day moving average of overall coffee prices rose above $ 1.144 a pound, triggering a 1-million bag increase in the amount of coffee that producing countries are allowed to export under the rules of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coffee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. But analysts say supplies of coffee remain very tight. In early 1986, under similar conditions, green coffee futures prices rose to nearly $ 2.80 a pound. `` We are not up there yet but we may get up there,'' said <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevenson </PERSON>, a coffee-market analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` It depends how much further these weather conditions bite into production.'' But <PERSON> Stevenson </PERSON> said prices were unlikely to return to the levels of 1976, when coffee futures peaked above $ 3.30 a pound. `` That was the year of a major frost in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, a major calamity,'' he said. `` The causes there were somewhat different.''

 Soybean futures made strong gains and grain futures closed moderately higher Friday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> amid rumors of new export business with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has bought an additional 750,000 metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn for delivery under a recently extended supply agreement between the two countries, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. The latest sales brought total corn sold to the Soviets to 8.78 million tons in the agreement's sixth year, which began Oct. 1. Last year, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn sales to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> totaled slightly less than 5.2 million tons. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 750,000 tons of corn would be about 29.5 million bushels. Corn prices have been averaging about $ 2.61 per bushel at the farm level, according to <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> estimates, meaning that the latest sale could have a farm value of around $ 77 million. Although no wheat has yet been sold for 1988-89 delivery under the pact, the Soviets have ordered 500,000 tons of soybeans and 532,500 tons of soybean meal, plus 500,000 tons of grain sorghum. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> on Nov. 28 signed an extension of the previous five-year grain agreement, which had expired Sept. 30. The extension of the previous pact will run through Dec. 31, 1990. Under terms of the agreement, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is committed to buy at least 9 million tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain annually, including a minimum of 4 million tons each of wheat and corn. The Soviets have the option of buying the remaining 1 million tons as wheat, corn or soybeans, with every ton of beans counting as two tons of grain _ up to a maximum of 1 million tons of grain equivalent.

 The stock market showed a small gain today in very quiet pre-Christmas trading. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 7.50 to 2,167.86 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.

Wall Streeters were expecting a quiet day as many investors opted to get an early start on the long holiday weekend. Brokers also said money managers at investing institutions had pretty much finished their maneuvering for the year. However, stocks did attract a few nibbles from buyers as the market opened. There has been a lot of talk lately of accumulating stocks before New Year's to try to benefit from the so-called January effect. Academic researchers have published many studies about an evident tendency of stock prices to rise in the first month of the year. Whether that phenomenon will persist in 1989, of course, remains to be seen.

 Government bond prices finished unchanged to higher Friday in abbreviated pre-holiday trading. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s bellwether 30-year-bond rose about 5-16 point, or $ 3 for every $ 1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves inversely to its price and is an important indicator of interest rate trends, declined to 8.90 percent from 8.93 percent late Thursday. Trading was slow in the absence of any new economic data and with many dealers getting an early jump on the Christmas holiday weekend. The market closed several hours earlier than usual, at around 1 p.m. EST. The financial markets will be closed on Monday in observance of Christmas. In the secondary market for <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds, prices of short-term government issues were unchanged to 1-32 point higher, intermediate maturities rose 1-32 point to 5-32 point and 20-year issues advanced 9-32 point, according to figures provided by <ORGANIZATION> Telerate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a financial information service. The <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Bond Index, which measures price movements on all outstanding <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> issues with maturities of a year or longer, rose 0.83 to 1,137.04. Yields on three-month <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills, meanwhile, rose to 8.33 percent as the discount edged up 1 basis point to 8.06 percent. Yields on six-month bills were unchanged at 8.61 percent as the discount held steady at 8.16 percent. Yields on one-year bills increased to 8.94 percent as the discount edged up 1 basis point to 8.27 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the annualized return on an investment in a <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bill. The discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face value, which is paid at maturity. The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was quoted at 813-16 percent, unchanged from late Thursday.

<HEAD>Copper Posts Strong Gains On Supply Fears</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Copper futures prices surged Friday in a shortened, pre-holiday session on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> as concerns about tight supplies strengthened their grip on the volatile market. On other futures markets Friday, precious metals, grains, soybeans, energy, livestock and meat futures all advanced while coffee fell slightly. Most markets closed at noon local time and will not reopen until Tuesday morning. Trading activity was uniformly light as many traders got an early start on the long Christmas weekend. Copper settled 1.1 cents to 3.2 cents higher with the spot December contract at $ 1.605 a pound and the more actively traded contract for delivery in March at $ 1.393 a pound. Prices advanced despite the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>'s report of a hefty increase overnight in its warehouse stocks of copper. Comex copper stocks rose by 1,376 tons to 9,582 tons. Analysts said they expected the stocks report to put pressure on the copper market, which saw the spot price hit a record high of $ 1.6475 a pound Dec. 8 on tight-supply fears. Instead, said New York-based analyst <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Savaiko </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, `` we closed stronger on lingering ideas that there's supply tightness that is not going to go away, especially if the economy remains resilient going into the first quarter of next year, which is normally the strongest period from a consumption standpoint.'' He said market players believed the rise in Comex stocks was temporary and that some traders were surprised the copper market was not following last year's pattern of leaping higher each day as the end of the year approached. `` But there's still a lack of production and strong demand, so while the pattern may not be repeating last year's exactly, the fundamentals are still strong,'' he said. Also on the Comex, gold settled 30 cents to 70 cents higher with February at $ 421.60 a troy ounce; silver was .20 cent to 1.1 cents higher with March at $ 6.275 a troy ounce. Soybean futures made strong gains and grain futures closed moderately higher Friday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> amid rumors of new export business with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. After the close, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announced a sale of 750,000 metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn to the Soviets, confirming one of the rumors that swept the grain pits during the shortened session. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> confirmed another rumor when it announced it had targeted the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for 2 million metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat at subsidized prices. And the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> also said it had increased the amount of grain the Soviets could buy annually under the two nations' long-term grain agreement to 16 million metric tons from 12 million metric tons. One rumor that was not confirmed was that the Soviets had already purchased as much as 1 million metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soybean meal, analysts said. `` These rumors ... kept sellers on the sidelines,'' said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON>, a trader with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Wheat settled 1 cent to 2 cents higher with March at $ 4.40 -LCB- a bushel; corn was \ cent to 1 -RCB- cents higher with March at $ 2.84 \ a bushel; oats were 3 cents to 5 cents higher with March at $ 2.37 a bushel; soybeans were 3 cents to 8 cents higher with January at $ 7.96 -LCB- a bushel Coffee futures prices slipped on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Coffee, <ORGANIZATION> Sugar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> on news that a Brazilian dockworkers' strike had ended. The strike began Dec. 13. Despite the strike's end, though, analysts said near-term availability of coffee remained extremely tight, a bullish factor as cold weather in the <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION> brings coffee consumption to its annual peak. Coffee settled .02 cent to 1.73 cents lower with March at $ 1.4937 a pound. Oil futures prices gained more ground on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in light, pre-holiday trading. Market sentiment has been upbeat in recent days, with many traders increasingly confident that <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members will abide by a production-cutting agreement forged last month. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 12 cents to 19 cents higher with February at $ 16.61 a barrel; heating oil was .46 cent to .79 cent higher with January at 53.14 cents gallon; unleaded gasoline was .29 cent to .72 cent higher with January at 46.86 cents a gallon. On the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, live cattle settled .47 cent to .67 cent higher with February at 74.37 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .32 cent to .70 cent higher with January at 84.22 cents a pound; live hogs were .05 cent to .73 cent higher with February at 47.30 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .15 cent to .43 cent higher with February at 44.50 cents a pound.

 The stock market showed a modest gain today in very quiet pre-Christmas trading. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 8.75 to 2,169.11 by 3 p.m. on Wall Street. Gainers outnumbered losers by about 3 to 2 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 810 up, 534 down and 546 unchanged. Wall Streeters were expecting a quiet day as many investors opted to get an early start on the long holiday weekend. Brokers also said money managers at investing institutions had pretty much finished their maneuvering for the year. However, stocks did attract a few nibbles from buyers as the market opened. There has been a lot of talk lately of accumulating stocks before New Year's to try to benefit from the so-called January effect. Academic researchers have published many studies about an evident tendency of stock prices to rise in the first month of the year. Whether that phenomenon will persist in 1989, of course, remains to be seen. American Brands, rumored to be a potential takeover target, jumped 9 -LRB- to 66 -RCB-.

<HEAD>American Brands Stock Shoots Up On Unilever Takeover Rumor</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brands </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> was closed Friday for the Christmas holiday, but that did n't stop Wall Street from briefly sending the tobacco company's stock up 22 percent on rumors of a takeover by <ORGANIZATION> Unilever </ORGANIZATION>, the British-Dutch consumer products conglomerate. Both companies declined to discuss the rumors, citing policies against commenting on speculation. One rumor said <ORGANIZATION> Unilever </ORGANIZATION> might pay as much as $ 90 a share for <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brands </ORGANIZATION>. American Brands got as high as $ 70.25 a share and was at $ 67.12 -LCB- in late trading on Wall Street, up $ 9.50, or 16 percent. <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaplan </PERSON>, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said the rumor was hard to substantiate. `` I've called a number of arbitragers that are very well tuned in and nobody knows,'' he said. If it came through, a purchase by <ORGANIZATION> Unilever </ORGANIZATION> would continue the trend of foreign takeovers as well as the trend of mergers in the tobacco and food businesses. In one such case, <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> last week submitted to a takeover bid by <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Grand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, a liquor distiller. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brands </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, is a perennially mentioned takeover candidate. Earlier this year it fought off a takeover bid by <ORGANIZATION> E-II </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> with the `` Pac-Man'' defense, in which it bought the would-be acquirer. It later sold most of E-II to <ORGANIZATION> Riklis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> E-II </ORGANIZATION>'s offering price for <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brands </ORGANIZATION> last spring was $ 55 a share But <PERSON> Kaplan </PERSON> said he estimated that the breakup value of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brands </ORGANIZATION> was about $ 95 a share, based on an estimate that investors would be willing to pay about nine times its operating cash flow minus debt. <ORGANIZATION> Unilever </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brands </ORGANIZATION> met once before, in 1986, when <ORGANIZATION> Unilever </ORGANIZATION> came in as a white knight to rescue <ORGANIZATION> Chesebrough-Pond </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> from a $ 2.8 billion hostile takeover offer from <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brands </ORGANIZATION>. It bought the company for $ 3.1 billion. American Brands, with revenue of about $ 10 billion a year, has a broad product line but makes most of its profits from its cigarette brands, which in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are Lucky Strike, <LOCATION> Tareyton </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Pall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mall </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Carlton </PERSON>, and the new <LOCATION> Malibu </LOCATION>. It owns <ORGANIZATION> Gallaher </ORGANIZATION>, the biggest British tobacco company. In distilled spirits, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brands </ORGANIZATION> sells <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Beam </PERSON> and Canadian Windsor whisky, <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuyper </PERSON> cordials and <PERSON> Gilbey </PERSON>'s gin and vodka. It owns <ORGANIZATION> Franklin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Master </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brands </ORGANIZATION>, which makes Master locks; Cushnet, the maker of Titleist golf balls; <ORGANIZATION> Acco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, maker of Swingline staplers and <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> office supplies; and <ORGANIZATION> Waterloo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>, the biggest distributor of toolboxes. <ORGANIZATION> Unilever </ORGANIZATION>, with annual revenue of more than $ 30 billion, is one of the world's biggest consumer products companies and has 300,000 employees worldwide, including 20,000 in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Report: Some Fares Much Higher After Northwest-Republic Merger</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Air travelers in the Minneapolis-St. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> area paid much higher fares to some destinations in the year after the local market became dominated by one airline, according to a report published Friday In a review of 27 routes where competition was reduced by <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' 1986 merger with <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, average fares rose on 23 routes, sometimes by more than 40 percent, the <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> reported. On all Northwest flights in and out of the Twin Cities, a separate study shows the average fare rose 18.5 percent, six times the national average, in the year after the merger, the newspaper said. <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Eagan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, disputes the findings. Airline officials said no broad conclusions could be drawn using isolated fare comparisons. The airline generated new data showing that Northwest flights were less expensive than similar flights from other airports by other carriers. In addition, <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s study found, passengers flying to the Twin Cities saved money over those connecting to other destinations. Northwest also said that, like most airlines, it was earning thin profit margins. Many factors help explain fare increases. But <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahn </PERSON>, the architect of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airline deregulation, said the broad pattern indicated in the newspaper's study of <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s fares appears to conform with `` every major study with which I am familiar.'' When airline concentration increases, he said, fares tend to rise.

<HEAD>`Junk Bond' Market Watchful in Wake of Drexel Settlement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The historic settlement of fraud charges by <LOCATION> Wall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> powerhouse <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> is n't expected to bring a major shakeup in the market for `` junk bonds'' pioneered and dominated by <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>. Still, market players are taking a cautious, wait-and-see attitude. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> announced this past Wednesday that <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> had reversed itself by agreeing to admit guilt to six felonies and pay a record $ 650 million fine to settle the biggest securities fraud case in history. Expectations of a <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> settlement had grown in recent days, and the $ 180 billion market for high-risk, high-yield junk bonds was n't taken by surprise In fact, bond traders seemed relieved that the business was over after dragging on for two years and the investment firm had decided not to wage a risky fight. A `` flight to quality'' out of junk bonds and into conventional securities, which had been predicted in some quarters as a result of the <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> debacle, failed to materialize. Prices of high-yield bonds were mostly little changed and even slightly higher in some cases in quiet trading. But a sort of edgy calm appeared to hang over the market as traders looked toward the new year and post-settlement prospects. `` Most people are taking a wait-and-see attitude,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, president of high-yield asset management at <ORGANIZATION> Kidder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. Market players are watching for further developments in the government's investigation that could prompt some junk bond traders at <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> to leave the firm `` This is n't over,'' said a market expert who asked not to be identified. He noted anxiety that the investigation could envelop some of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s clients, who include many well-known takeover strategists. Some of those clients said privately this past week they still needed to review whether the plea-bargaining arrangement would change their close business relationship with <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>. That, traders fear, could potentially affect <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s ability to continue to sell mammoth junk bond issues, such as the one being used to help finance the $ 24.5 billion leveraged buyout of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> by <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co. The market points to the <LOCATION> Nabisco </LOCATION> issue as evidence that <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> is still a force to be reckoned with. The other players in the junk bond market _ notably <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> _ might lack the clout of dominant <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> in selling huge issues, some experts suggest. `` I do n't really think we're going to see a sea change in the market,'' said <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Lemanski </PERSON>, director of high-yield securities research at <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION>. There should n't be a major change in terms of the volume of junk issues coming to market or their prices and yields, <PERSON> Lemanski </PERSON> said. But he and other observers conceded that some segments of the market could be affected by traders leaving <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>. In addition to `` mega'' issues like <PERSON> Nabisco </PERSON>, junk bonds at the other end of the spectrum, worth less than $ 100 million or so, also could present a problem, analysts say. That's because the effort and expense involved in researching the companies issuing small bonds has kept all the players except <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> from bothering with them. Some of the smaller issues `` could come under pressure,'' <PERSON> Lemanski </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Dallas Investor Simmons Files to Boost Stake, Says No Takeover</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CALABASAS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Friday it had shored up its takeover defenses after <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> investor <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> disclosed he might boost his stake in the aerospace company. But <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> said he considered his stake in <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION>, builder of the Stealth fighter and other military hardware, an investment only. `` It's not that big a deal. ... We have no intention of trying to buy the whole company,'' <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>' <ORGANIZATION> Valhi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> filed notice Dec. 7 under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act that he intended to boost his <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> stake beyond $ 15 million, the trigger point for the act's disclosure provisions. <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Slayman </PERSON> refused to say if changes in the company's 2-year-old `` poison pill'' shareholder rights plan were a direct response to <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>' move. At the time of the filing, <ORGANIZATION> Valhi </ORGANIZATION> said it owned 375,000 of <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION>'s 59.5 million outstanding shares, or 0.63 percent. <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> said the filing was intended to give him leeway to buy more <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> stock with money anticipated from the planned sale of his <ORGANIZATION> Amalgamated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sugar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> to a British firm. However, that $ 300 million deal fell through, he said. The investor said he had not discussed the matter with <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> officials. A <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> board vote to tighten the firm's takeover defenses was taken Thursday, two weeks after the filing, <PERSON> Slayman </PERSON> said. The revised plan allows present shareholders to buy newly issued stock at a discount if an outsider buys 20 percent or more of the common stock. Such poison pill plans are intended to dilute the holdings of a potential buyer, making a takeover prohibitively expensive. <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION>, with headquarters in this <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> suburb, has 88,000 employees in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. The nation's fourth-largest defense contractor, <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> had sales of $ 11.3 billion in 1987. In the first three quarters of this year, it reported a net profit of $ 520 million on sales of $ 7.6 billion, with the profit figure boosted significantly by sale of a subsidiary. Projects include the top-secret F-117A Stealth fighter, the Trident II nuclear missile, the C-5B transport plane and work on military communications, satellites, and the Strategic Defense Initiative or Star Wars. The company also is a subcontractor for design work on <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s space station project.

<HEAD>Drexel Deal May Exclude Insider Trading; Protect Individuals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Speculation grew Friday that the historic plea deal sparing <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> from a wide-ranging indictment excludes insider trading charges and omits names of at least some individual lawbreakers. Sources who spoke on condition they not be identified said the pact was structured to minimize the investment giant's exposure to private civil lawsuits and put the staggering securities fraud case behind it for good. But few specifics of the settlement could be learned, and by late Friday no formal document had been filed by the <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Anreder </PERSON> said it was unclear when details would be released. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> agreed to settle the biggest fraud case in Wall Street history Wednesday by paying a record $ 650 million in fines and restitution to the government and pleading guilty to six felony counts. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, quoting unidentified <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> employees, reported Friday that the six counts would concern alleged manipulations of stock in <ORGANIZATION> Stone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Container </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Fischbach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> C.O.M.B. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, as well as `` stock parking'' violations in <ORGANIZATION> Phillips </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Graphics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Stock parking involves hiding ownership of stock in someone else's name to avoid <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> disclosure requirements Five of the transactions mentioned by the Times involved <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s relationship with <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, the now-imprisoned inside trader who implicated the firm and its high-yield bond financier <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> when <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> himself was exposed more than two years ago The C.O.M.B. transaction was said to involve <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s relationship with <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>, a small <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> securities concern that was dissolved earlier this month because of racketeering and fraud charges against five of its principals and a former <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> bond trader Pleading guilty to manipulation and parking charges is considered less serious than insider trading, which is the use of nonpublic information to profit in securities dealings. Lawyers said these pleas likely would lessen <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s vulnerability to multiple lawsuits by private investors, since it is difficult to prove financial losses resulted from such wrongdoing The Times asserted that none of the charges would specifically name any people who committed wrongdoing, which could further insulate the firm and the individuals from civil litigation. But sources reached by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> said it was n't clear whether individuals would be named, suggesting this was still an unresolved matter. The plea agreement capped an investigation of the Wall Street giant that snowballed into the biggest securities fraud probe ever and raised disturbing questions about the extent of greed and conflicts of interest among the big dealers in the investment banking business. The agreement still requires approval from the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>, which has accused <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> and other employees of far more widespread and insidious charges in a civil suit filed nearly four months ago. There was no word Friday on whether the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> would seek additional sanctions against <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> before consenting to the plea agreement and dropping the suit. But there was widespread speculation that the enforcement agency would require the expulsion of <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> from the securities business and would likely impose stiff restraints on the operations of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> high-yield bond department, which <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> currently heads. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s agreement to cooperate in the government investigation greatly increases pressure on <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> himself to settle as-yet unfiled charges against him, which reportedly include racketeering counts that carry enormous fines and lengthy prison terms if he is convicted. But spokesmen for <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> said Friday that he was still maintaining his innocence, and if indicted he would vindicate himself in court.

 Takeover news and rumors, plus some yearend `` bargain'' shopping by traders, enabled the stock market to post a moderate gain in light pre-Christmas trading Friday. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 8.57 to 2,168.93, finishing the week with a net gain of 18.22 points. Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 7 to 4 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 851 up, 488 down and 579 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 81.76 million shares, down from 150.51 million Thursday and the lightest total since a 72.09 million-share day on Nov. 25, the Friday after Thanksgiving. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 99.13 million shares. Wall Streeters had expected a quiet day as many investors opted to get an early start on the long holiday weekend. Brokers also said money managers at investing institutions had pretty much finished their maneuvering for the year. However, stocks did attract a few nibbles from buyers as the market opened. There has been a lot of talk on the Street lately of accumulating stocks before New Year's to try to benefit from the so-called January effect. Academic researchers have published many studies about an evident tendency of stock prices to rise in the first month of the year. Whether that phenomenon will persist in 1989, of course, remains to be seen. In addition to that kind of bargain-hunting, those traders who were present had several hot takeover stocks on their hands. American Brands, rumored to be a potential takeover target, led the active list and jumped 10 -LRB- to 67 -RCB-. One unconfirmed report was that <ORGANIZATION> Unilever </ORGANIZATION> was preparing to offer as much as $ 90 a share. <ORGANIZATION> Rexene </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which said Thursday that it was engaged in talks with a possible acquirer, climbed 6 \ to 24 -LCB- <ORGANIZATION> Cummins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engine </ORGANIZATION> shot up 8 ~ to 67 <ORGANIZATION> Hanson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> said it bought more than 8 percent of the company's stock for `` investment'' purposes, and <PERSON> Cummins </PERSON> said it intended to remain independent. <ORGANIZATION> Lin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> rose 2 -LRB- to 68 in the over-the-counter market. A group including <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cellular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> said it plans to ask for regulatory approval to increase its stake in the company. Gainers among the blue-chip and technology issues included <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION>, up 1 -LCB- at 101 -RRB-; <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION>, up -LRB- at 29 -LRB-; <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION>, up 1 -RRB- at 97 -RRB-, and <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION>, up ~ at 123 -RRB-. As measured by <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>' index of more than 5,000 actively traded stocks, the market increased $ 10.58 billion, or 0.39 percent, in value. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks gained .56 to 156.06. <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's industrial index rose 1.39 to 321.28, and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P's 500-stock composite index was up 1.00 at 277.87 The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market added .84 to 377.34. At the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the market value index closed at 302.22, up 1.89.

 <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> reported a 35.9 percent leap in car sales in mid-December as overall sales of U.S.-made cars and light trucks jumped 14.4 percent ahead of the same period in 1987, automakers reported Friday. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> makers and foreign companies manufacturing in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> said they sold an average of 34,919 vehicles a day in the eight selling days from Dec. 11-20, up from 30,522 a day in the same period a year earlier. The Big Three <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> automakers alone reported selling at a slightly slower 33,081 vehicle-a-day rate but that was up 15.3 percent from 28,689 a day in mid-December 1987. Sales moved at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 8.2 million vehicles, up from 7.2 million a year earlier. A year ago, with the Oct. 19 stock market crash still fresh in their minds, people were gun-shy about large purchases, said <PERSON> Jeanette </PERSON> <PERSON> Garretty </PERSON>, analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. `` Generally, things have been a lot more stable in these last few periods of 1988,'' she said. In the latest period, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said it sold 6,764 cars a day, up from 4,977 a day a year earlier. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said its truck sales of 4,118 a day were up 21.5 percent from 3,391 a day in the year-ago period. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> reported the greatest increase in light-truck sales, a 28.1-percent jump to 3,177 a day from 2,481 in the 1987 period. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> said its car sales reached 3,375 a day, up 20.5 percent from 2,801 a day. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said its car sales rose 4.7 percent to a 10,365-a-day average, up from 9,896 a year earlier, and truck sales increased 12.7 percent to 5,282 a day from 5,144. Sales of all U.S.-made cars and light trucks reached 11,322,465 for the year to date. Sales, now in the final period of the calendar year, appeared unlikely to approach the record 16.3 million of 1986, second-best 15.7 million of 1985 or third-best 15.4 million of 1978. `` I do n't see a real kick in sales here at the end of December,'' <PERSON> Garretty </PERSON> said. `` But it's a good year. Everybody will take it.''

 The energy futures market ended the week on a strong note, although trading was extremely quiet in advance of the Christmas holiday. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the February contract for <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION>, the benchmark grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude, settled at $ 16.61 a barrel Friday, up 12 cents from Thursday, when it rose 19 cents. Other contract months were higher. Among refined petroleum products traded on the exchange Friday, the Jaunuary contract for wholesale home heating oil rose 0.66 cent to 53.14 a gallon. On Thursday the contract gained 0.56 cent. January wholesale unleaded gasoline, which rose 0.87 cent in the previous session, increased 0.29 cent to 46.86 cents a gallon. Market sentiment has been upbeat in recent days, with many traders increasingly confident that <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members will abide by a production-cutting agreement forged last month. Although new production quotas are n't scheduled to begin until Jan. 1, some members of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> already have begun to cut output, analysts say.
