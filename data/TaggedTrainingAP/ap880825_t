 Professor <PERSON> Josiah </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> is an expert on such noted philosophers as <PERSON> Kierkegaard </PERSON>, <PERSON> Nietzsche </PERSON> _ and <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Spade </PERSON>. <PERSON> Spade </PERSON>? What in the name of <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Bogart </PERSON> is going on here? A career change, that's what. In 1976, <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, driven by a `` thirst for experience,'' left his tenured position as professor of philosophy at <ORGANIZATION> Haverford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> _ a prestigous Quaker school in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, came to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and became a private detective. He could n't have picked a better city in which to set up shop. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s hills are steeped in the lore of <PERSON> Dashiell </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammett </PERSON> and his legendary sleuth, <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Spade </PERSON>, the `` blond Satan'' whose hair darkened when brought to the screen by <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Bogart </PERSON> in `` The Maltese Falcon.'' There's even a bronze plaque on a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> street, recalling a murder that took place only in <PERSON> Hammett </PERSON>'s mind: `` On approximately this spot Miles <PERSON> Archer </PERSON>, partner of <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Spade </PERSON>, was done in by <PERSON> Brigid </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Shaughnessy </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, whose previous writings were mostly limited to the academic world, has recounted his metamorphosis in a book appropriately called `` Gumshoe: Reflections in a Private Eye'' -LRB- Little, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, $ 17.95 -RRB-. He was born 53 years ago in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Liverpool </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, where his father sold dishes. During World War I, his father took a pair of field glasses from a dead German and gave them to the youngster. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, whose nickname is Tink, still uses the glasses on cases. He keeps them hanging over his desk and has used them on stakeouts. Even though slightly built, he played halfback in high school, closing his eyes `` on every play.'' Later, he was under fire in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> as an ensign with a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Underwater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Demolition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Team </ORGANIZATION>, the elite Frogmen. Why did he become a professor in the first place, going from football bruises and the sound of warfare to the safety of a college campus? `` I had plenty of money when I got out of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, with demolition and combat pay,'' he said. `` I was a good student in high school so I went to <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION> and from there took the line of least resistance.'' When that line became a cul-de-sac, he took a sabbatical and grabbed a job with an established detective agency in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. During his apprenticeship and as his own boss, <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> has worked on such headline cases as the defense of <PERSON> Black </PERSON> <PERSON> Panther </PERSON> <PERSON> Huey </PERSON> <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> on assault and murder charges, and the defense of <PERSON> William </PERSON> and <PERSON> Emily </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> in the <PERSON> Patty </PERSON> <PERSON> Hearst </PERSON> case. There were also other, less publicized capers, ranging from recovering $ 30,000 from under the floorboards of an attic in a drug case to retrieving a kidnapped child from <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, sells real estate. They have two adult daughters and a son who plays soccer in college. He never carries a gun and he thinks the most dangerous part of his job is `` mistaken identity.'' `` I was taken for a spy on a case in <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` And one time in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, while working on a drug case, word got around that a hit man was being brought in. When people heard I was from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, some of them thought I was the guy. The bars would clear when I came in.'' While honing his skills as a gumshoe, <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> has become fascinated by <PERSON> Hammett </PERSON> and <PERSON> Spade </PERSON>, so much so that on one case he took the time to interview some of <PERSON> Hammett </PERSON>'s relatives. <PERSON> Hammett </PERSON>, through <PERSON> Spade </PERSON>, was a bit of a philosopher, he says. `` In order to love, one must put off hardness and shiftiness,'' <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said. `` The ability to lie effectively, to appear different than one really is, all the disguises essential in the world of power, become, in the world of love, temptations, artful excuses to avoid the nakedness love requires, to avoid love.'' <PERSON> Hammett </PERSON> knew this, he said. `` That's why in the last line of The Maltese Falcon he makes <PERSON> Spade </PERSON> ` shiver' as he looks down the cold barrel of his future.''

<DATELINE>YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A fire that has charred a 35-mile swath across the heart of <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> threatened one of the park's most picturesque areas and forced out hundreds of visitors, officials said Wednesday. The rapidly burning North Fork fire, which started July 23 in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Targhee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>, grew to nearly 100,000 acres and forced the closure Wednesday morning of the Canyon area. Winds expected to reach 50 mph Wednesday in the park failed to materialize, and by nightfall the fire remained one mile to the west of the area, which is located a bit north of the center of the 60-mile-square park. Elsewhere, crews southeast of <LOCATION> Helena </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, said they expected to contain the 37,600-acre <LOCATION> Warm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> blaze by Friday evening; and in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, air tankers and fire crews fought a surging, 1,000-acre blaze on the slopes of <LOCATION> Hells </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canyon </LOCATION>, the nation's deepest gorge The closure of Canyon, <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>'s largest development with 600 cabins and 280 campsites, sent more than 700 visitors and employees to other parts of the park. `` My children are all excited about it,'' said tourist <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Staffordshire </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. `` It did n't detract from our visit at all.'' By midmorning Wednesday, only firefighters and reporters remained at Canyon, and the buzzing of chain saws filled the air as crews hurriedly removed downed trees and undergrowth. Smoke in the air partially obscured the view of the 308-foot Lower Falls and 109-foot Upper Falls. Fire officials said they hoped to keep the North Fork fire burning to the north of the Canyon area, but feared that embers could bring the blaze right into Canyon. <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Rotter </PERSON>, a park service public information officer, said the North Fork fire could then conceivably burn from Canyon and into the area blackened by the Clover Mist fire some miles to the east, in effect cutting the park virtually in two. Although not the biggest of the 10 fires that have burned more than 354,000 acres in <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fork </LOCATION> blaze has become the most dangerous to structures. Firefighters previously had come near to containing the fire, but the lack of rainfall combined with winds gusting to 60 mph repeatedly have fanned it out of control. The 156,500-acre Clover Mist fire earlier this week swung into the Shoshone National Forest east of <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>. In the national forest, 635 Army regulars were working with professional firefighters to halt the advance. The so-called Snake Complex of fires, which includes the Red, Shoshone and Falls fires in southern Yellowstone, spread over 80,000 acres by Wednesday. While forcing the closure of the <LOCATION> Grant </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> area and the park's south entrance, the fires were not threatening any structures. Fires also posed threats both north and south of the park. To the south in Grand Teton National Park and the <ORGANIZATION> Bridger-Teton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>, firefighters dwarfed by 150-foot walls of flame battled to keep the 12,600-acre <PERSON> Huck </PERSON> fire from crossing into <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> about 1 -LCB- miles away. The fire had more than doubled in size from Tuesday to Wednesday. Just over the <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> line north of the park, nearly 600 additional firefighters and a top-level fire-management team from <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> arrived Wednesday to take over the 27,000-acre Storm Creek fire. The blaze is burning out of control in a wilderness area seven miles north of <LOCATION> Cooke </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, a town near the northeast corner of the park. Near <PERSON> Helena </PERSON>, crews had expected to contain the 37,600-acre Warm Springs Creek blaze Wednesday night, but pushed the deadline back two days because of one troublesome area along the fire lines, fire information officer <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Krepps </PERSON> said. The 2-week-old fire has burned more than a dozen structures. `` Once that's done and held, there's nothing much left to cause us any problem,'' <PERSON> Krepps </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` We're getting close. The noose is tightening.'' In <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, more than 400 firefighters were committed to the Eagle Bar blaze in <LOCATION> Hells </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canyon </LOCATION>, which was burning out of control with no containment target in sight. The blaze made two significant runs Wednesday, moving into the <LOCATION> Deep </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> drainage containing 12 million board feet of timber and toward the base camp at <LOCATION> Kinney </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>. In southern <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, a fire in Crater Lake National Park that charred 85 acres Tuesday grew to more than 1,000 acres Wednesday, burning across the park boundary into neighboring <ORGANIZATION> Winema </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>. In central Oregon, firefighters nearly contained a blaze that charred 110 acres and forced the brief evacuation of three homes, but several lightning-caused blazes elsewhere in the state were reported out of control. In southwestern <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, calmer winds and cooler temperatures allowed firefighters to cut a containment line around 75 percent of a 500-acre fire 30 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rainier </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, officials said. The fire grew from 60 acres to 500 on Tuesday thanks to gusty wind, 100-degree air and low humidity.

<HEAD>Consumer Division Work Was Overstated, Report Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CLEVELAND (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s version of duties he handled as a consumer watchdog when he worked for the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> attorney general in 1970-71 appear to be exaggerated, an <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> newspaper reports in its Friday editions. The -LRB- <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> -RRB- Plain Dealer reported that state records in the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> archives reveal that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, 41, was a research assistant _ an entry-level job _ in the attorney general's office for most of that time, and held the consumer watchdog job for only 2 -LCB- months, from July to mid-September in 1971. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> biography, which is being distributed as official background of the Republican vice-presidential nominee, says: `` He was chief investigator for the Consumer Protection Division of the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> Attorney General's Office from 1970-1971.'' The Plain Dealer reported that the division was just being organized at the time. `` He just helped set it up,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lybrook </PERSON>, a lawyer in <LOCATION> Martinsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, who became the chief investigator in September 1971, when the division officially opened for business. State personnel records show <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was already working for then-Gov. <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitcomb </PERSON> as an administrative assistant when the consumer division was officially launched. The consumer division had been created earlier in 1971 by the <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>. The division was empowered to help resolve consumer complaints over such things as defective products, false advertising, odometer tampering and mail-order fraud. `` I do n't remember when <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> first started out,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> lawyer who was the consumer division's first director <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was assigned to his staff for a brief time before leaving to work in the governor's office. Said <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanton </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, an editor at the <ORGANIZATION> Indianapolis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> who arranged <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s job interview with then-Attorney General <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sendak </PERSON>: `` He sure did n't start in that -LRB- consumer -RRB- job. He was n't chief of anything when he went over there. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> worked for <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pulliam </PERSON>, publisher of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>'s largest newspapers and <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s grandfather State records show that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, who graduated from <ORGANIZATION> DePauw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in May 1969 with a political science degree, went to work in the attorney general's office as a `` legal assistant'' in January 1970. The job is similar to that of a law clerk. It involved drafting legal memoranda, performing research for opinions and writing letters, according to other employees who worked in the attorney general's office at the time. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was attending night school at <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> at the same time. The office's annual report, filed in the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> state archives, shows <PERSON> Sendak </PERSON> did n't have a consumer division in 1970. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s picture was in the report with those of seven other research assistants <PERSON> Sendak </PERSON>'s 1971 annual report, which he was required to file under state law, has the pictures of the three staffers in the new consumer division. The three included <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, as the director, <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mather </PERSON> as assistant director and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lybrook </PERSON> as chief investigator. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was not even listed as being on the attorney general's staff.

 A former <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> sergeant arrested in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> headed an international spy ring that sold <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> defense secrets to the Soviets at high prices for a decade, officials said Thursday. `` We ca n't exclude the possibility that millions of dollars are involved,'' said <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Prechtel </PERSON>, spokesman for the chief federal prosecutor's office. A second American soldier who was not identified received a `` five-figure sum'' of money for supplying the ring with military secrets, said Chief Federal Prosecutor <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Rebmann </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Prechtel </PERSON> said two Hungarian-born brothers arrested Tuesday in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> with cipher keys, coded messages and radios were a part of the ring. It was too early to know how much damage was caused to the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Prechtel </PERSON> said in an interview, but the ring is believed to have stolen documents concerning <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> defense plans for <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> contingency plans for a ground war with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON>, the former sergeant, was arrested Tuesday, and a statement from the prosecutor's office said he was charged with `` compelling suspicion of espionage activities in an especially grave case.'' The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> in its Friday editions quoted officials as saying <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> gave away information on rocket bases and a secret <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> oil pipeline in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to resupply tanks. The report from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> did not identify the officials. <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> was born in 1947 in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and worked for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military for 20 years, <PERSON> Prechtel </PERSON> said. Army records list his hometown as Sebring, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. He worked as an infantryman and then as an `` administration specialist'' during his active duty, according to his service records released in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> received the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medal </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Vietnam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medal </ORGANIZATION>, five Army Commendation medals, the Army Achievement Medal, three <ORGANIZATION> Meritorious </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> medals and seven Good Conduct medals. <PERSON> Prechtel </PERSON> said <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> worked with classified military defense plans for seven years at a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> base in <LOCATION> Bad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kreuznach </LOCATION>, in central <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, and had access to a wide array of secret documents. <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> allegedly continued espionage work after he left the service in 1985, <PERSON> Prechtel </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Rebmann </PERSON> said <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> turned over the most recent batch of information to his Soviet bloc contact in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> just last month. Cable News Network on Thursday quoted unidentified West German sources as saying <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> systematically photographed files between 1980 and 1985. The <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> report said investigators believe he may have transferred material onto a personal computer, which was seized at his home. Espionage cases are common in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, where Soviet bloc agents are active and sometimes are caught. But allegations of deep involvement by an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizen in a West German-based ring are extremely rare. An official at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity, called the case `` a serious encroachment on our national security.'' White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had been kept informed about the investigation `` on a continuing basis.'' But he added, `` We wo n't have any response or reaction at this point. We're looking into it.'' A special panel of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ordered <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> held in prison pending further investigation, <PERSON> Rebmann </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Prechtel </PERSON> said the West German-based spy ring started in the late 1970s and used couriers from <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Goteborg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, authorities said they detained two Hungarian-born brothers who confessed to working for the Hungarian secret service. The two men, physicians who immigrated to <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> in the 1960s, were detained with radios, cipher keys and coded messages, authorities said. Their names were not released. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday that eight people were arrested by Swedish and West German in the ring operating through a German-Hungarian connection. The report said investigators believe the spy ring provided <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, West German and <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> secrets to the <LOCATION> Hungarian </LOCATION> intelligence agency. The Hungarians then shared the secrets with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, officials told the Times. <PERSON> Prechtel </PERSON>, speaking from his office in the city of <LOCATION> Karlsruhe </LOCATION>, confirmed virtually all of the Times report. But he said `` several'' people were taken into custody or arrested and could not confirm that the number was eight. The Times said the network was uncovered by West German and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, including agents from the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. The Army has about 250,000 military personnel in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> at more than 200 installations and frequently warns its personnel to beware of Soviet bloc spies. <PERSON> Rebmann </PERSON> said <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> `` is under compelling suspicion of having delivered ... documents to a Soviet bloc secret service by means of a command officer and couriers living abroad in return for high payments.'' He did not identify the command officer but said the two last met in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> last month when <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> allegedly again handed over secret documents for payment. After his retirement, <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> tried to recruit other soldiers for espionage, <PERSON> Rebmann </PERSON> said. `` He recruited another member of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> for espionage work and paid him a five-figure sum for the delivery of military documents,'' <PERSON> Rebmann </PERSON>'s statement said. The type of currency was not disclosed. The prosecutor's spokesman declined to release any further information about the second soldier.

 Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said Thursday that cocaine imports have tripled in seven years and charged the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration with permitting a `` drug cancer'' to take root. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he represents `` proven tested leadership'' and likened his presidential rival to <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sparred long distance as their vice presidential running mates encountered turbulence on their own campaign rounds. Democrat <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was booed repeatedly when he praised <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> before the Veterans of Foreign Wars meeting in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` The simple truth is, Gov. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is a veteran, a patriot and an advocate of American strength and steadiness,'' the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator said. Republican vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was greeted in <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, by competing groups of supporters and demonstrators and a few signs that read, `` War Wimp'' and `` <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s a Chicken.'' That was a reference to the furor over his <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> service at the height of the Vietnam War. The <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator told reporters the public was `` getting a little sick'' of the controversy, and at a meeting later with farmers, he added, `` I wo n't take any questions'' about the subject. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said he was qualified to assume the presidency `` if that situation arises.'' He added that at 41, he is nearly as old as <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was when he won the White House. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> faced new questions on his resume, however. The -LRB- <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> -RRB- Plain Dealer reported in its Friday editions that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> held an entry-level job in the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> attorney general's office for most of the time he claimed to be `` chief investigator'' for the office's Consumer Protection Division The candidates spoke as the debate over campaign debates continued in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Neuman </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voters </ORGANIZATION>, said she was encouraged that aides to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would meet next week to begin negotiations on debates for the fall. Democratic chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> criticized <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for indicating on Wednesday that he wanted to wait until at least Sept. 20 before meeting <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in debate. `` ... He's not going to be able to refuse to debate,'' <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> leveled a sharp attack on the drug policies pursued by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, and said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had failed in his task as a leader in the administration war on drugs. He said the administration was `` actively in business with -LRB- <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> -RRB- General <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> while <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was involved in drug activity. `` My friends, that's criminal. That's criminal,'' he said. `` Why after seven years of task forces and policy boards and grandiose claims have cocaine imports tripled, drug-related deaths doubled and heroin imports risen by 50 percent?'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> added in a speech in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>. He said the `` drug cancer'' was undermining governments overseas and was the `` single greatest cause of violence in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> today.'' An upbeat <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the campaign momentum belonged to him as he opened a four-day campaign swing through his adopted home state of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. He said the country needs `` proven, tested leadership'' in the White House. The vice president compared <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to former President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, adding he did not want to return to the `` malaise'' that occurred `` the last time a governor came out of nowhere and became president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> won the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in 1976 campaigning as a former governor of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. Standing in the late-summer heat in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told a riverfront rally that he would revive the faltering oil industry, create a better climate for small business, fight against federal gun control and provide jobs for the state's large minority population. `` I want to help these minorities who have n't really had a shot at the starting line,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made no mention of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> in his remarks, but said, `` Yes, I do,'' when asked if he thought the controversy was behind him. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, meanwhile, appeared to be softening his stance on the Strategic Defense Initiative. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in its Friday editions as saying a decision on whether to deploy a full or partial Star Wars defense system must await more research into its capabilities and costs. `` I do n't think we yet know what the price tag will be,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` If you went to a full deployment of a full strategic defense, it would be very expensive. What I want to do is to continue reserach at the levels of funding, essentially, that we have requested.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was wearing his VFW cap as he defended <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> before a hostile audience. `` The simple truth is this: Gov. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is a veteran, a patriot and an advocate of American strength and steadiess,'' he said. `` He can be trusted as a defender of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> security _ and as a champion of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> values.'' But the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator and World War bomber pilot was interrupted four times by booing, including once when he said that <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> had begun the much-heralded defense buildup. The booing appeared to be led by <ORGANIZATION> VFW </ORGANIZATION> members from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, and at one point the organizations's national commander, <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stock </PERSON><PERSON> , </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, appealed for quiet. `` I had a tough assignment and I fulfilled it,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. `` Obviously some of them did n't want to hear it.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> campaigned through the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, telling his audiences it was time to `` talk about the future'' and not his controversial past. Referring to questions about his Vietnam-era stint in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said the public is `` getting a little bit sick'' of that issue. `` I've answered questions for seven days now,'' he told reporters as he arrived in <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION>. `` We're going to talk about the future. We're going to talk about jobs. We're going to talk about other issues that the American people are interested in.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said he was qualified to be elected to a job placing him first in line for the presidency. `` I am qualified if that situiation arises,'' the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator said. `` I'm very close to the same age as <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was when he was elected.'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was 43 in 1960 when he won the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and had been in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for eight years, compared to 12 for <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Dade Teacher Salaries Bring Flood Of Applications</HEAD>

 <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s approval of a whopping 28 percent teacher salary increase and a larger role for teachers in school decision-making has brought a flood of applications from around the country, officials say. News of the new contract approved by the <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> school board last month has `` spread like wildfire,'' said <PERSON> Terence </PERSON> <PERSON> Garner </PERSON>, director of teacher recruitment in <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. `` My desk is literally covered with messages from people calling and wanting applications or copies of the contract sent,'' said <PERSON> Garner </PERSON>. `` We have enough candidates so principals can look at five to eight people for every one position,'' <PERSON> Garner </PERSON> said. `` We promised the school board we're going to hire the cream of the crop and now we're getting it.'' Last-minute hiring is under way and is expected to continue even after classes begin Monday in the <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s system, which includes the city of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. With about 255,000 students and more than 15,200 teachers, it's the nation's fourth-largest. There's also an avalanche of applications in <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, where the city school district attracted national attention last fall with a contract that boosted salaries and gave teachers more responsibility. `` When we go to college recruiting fairs, we have lines of people waiting to talk to us,'' said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Delaney </PERSON>, director of teacher personnel for the district. The three-year contract in <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION> raised salaries an average 40 percent over three years and offered some teachers who accept difficult assignments and work longer hours the chance to make $ 70,000 a year by the third year of the contract. In <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, average teacher pay will rise to $ 33,066 the first year of the contract, 9 percent above last year's pay of $ 30,000. Veteran teachers with doctorates could earn up to $ 64,000 a year. By the third year of the contract, the average pay would rise to $ 39,646, 28 percent above last year's pay. The contract also calls for expanding teachers' say in school decision-making. Teachers, principals and union stewards will sit together on faculty councils and make shared decisions, and teacher committees will help design schools and hire principals. Teachers are expected to approve it overwhelmingly when they vote Thursday and Friday. Dade's $ 33,066 average salary will be the highest in the state, nearly $ 8,000 above <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s statewide average in 1987-88 and more than $ 5,000 above the 1987-88 national average of $ 28,031, as calculated by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think many other districts will have to follow what we've done in order to be competitive,'' <PERSON> Garner </PERSON> said `` Teacher salaries all over will have to continue to rise.'' But state school officials say it could be some time before districts elsewhere in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> follow <PERSON> Dade </PERSON>'s lead. `` I think <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> has unique characteristics. The cost of living is more in <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, the union-administration relationship is extremely strong and cooperative, the emphasis on local solutions is greater there than anywhere else,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Voss </PERSON>, spokesman for Education Commissioner <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Castor </PERSON>. `` We probably have the best labor-management relationship in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Annette </PERSON> <PERSON> Katz </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> teachers' union. `` That happened over a number of years, and it happened because of trust.'' <PERSON> Katz </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dade </PERSON>'s contract could encourage frustrated teachers elsewhere in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> to flock to the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> area, although other spokesmen say <PERSON> Dade </PERSON>'s real competition is other large urban districts nationwide, not other <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> districts. `` We're not trying to raid people, but yes, people are interested,'' <PERSON> Katz </PERSON> said. `` We have to recruit the best teachers we can find.'' <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON>, executive vice president of the teachers union in <LOCATION> Duval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, which includes the city of <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, agreed that things are better in <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION>. `` We've made some of the same proposals that <PERSON> Dade </PERSON> has but there's been no interest at the administrative level in shared decision-making,'' she said. `` Teachers have only a minimal input in every area.'' Management's latest offer in <PERSON> Duval </PERSON> is for a 4 percent pay hike, she said.

 Officials have dumped more than 30,000 gallons of milk at a dairy farm following the recent deaths of more than 20 cows, possibly from something they ate, authorities said. The milk apparently was not contaminated but was dumped as a public health precaution until the cause of the cow deaths is determined, according to officials from the farm and the state agriculture department. `` I do not believe there is any contaminant or toxicant causing the cattle deaths,'' <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Boosinger </PERSON>, director of the division of dairy industry for the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday. `` But it's better to err on the side of public health and safety and recommend that they not market the milk.'' <PERSON> Boosinger </PERSON> said milk, water, and feed samples, as well as tissue samples from one of the cows that died during the past two weeks, were collected from the 967-acre Imagination Farms, which milks 1,100 cows. Test results were not expected until later this week.

 The number of people throughout the world who belong to the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> declined slightly from 1986 to 1987, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Hoover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>. Total membership decreased from 89.8 million in 1986 to 88.6 million the following year, the conservative think tank at <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> reported in its 1988 Yearbook on Communist Affairs. That compares with a 7.6 percent increase in party membership from 1985 to 1986, the yearbook reported. The publication also has recorded a leap of more than 70 percent in international Communist membership since the early 1970s, when the total was about 50 million. The small drop from 1986 to 1987 indicates that Communists around the world are fed up with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, said yearbook editor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Staar </PERSON>. `` -LRB- It -RRB- can be attributed to several factors. ...

<HEAD>Justice Department's Ethics Program Faulted</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Congressional investigators are faulting the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> for not routinely evaluating its ethics program or providing enough training on ethics. The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, in a report released Wednesday, also said the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is the only federal agency that does not require many of its employees to file confidential financial disclosure forms. `` Other agencies have found such reports to be a necessary part of their ethics program,'' the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said. High-ranking Justice employees, like those at other agencies, must submit public financial disclosure forms under the 1978 Ethics in Government Act. But every agency except Justice requires civil servants with significant duties and responsibilities to file the confidential forms listing assets, investments and a spouse's job. `` This deviation from the practice elsewhere in the government is based on <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>'s view that there has been no legal authority to require confidential reports since January 1979 when the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 took effect,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' auditing arm Justice officials have said they will ask for the confidential forms when the Office of Government Ethics, which monitors the act, submits final regulations, possibly this fall. An official at the ethics office said Justice was the only agency that has balked at the confidential forms. `` We have recognized for years that they -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials -RRB- desperately need a confidential system,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. `` They are the main law enforcement branch; they should have it.'' The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said the overall Justice ethics program `` contains many of the basic elements required by law and regulations. ... However, certain required elements are missing.'' Ethics programs are handled by the various divisions of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Allegations of ethical misconduct are reported to the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Professional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Responsibility </ORGANIZATION>, which reports to the attorney general. As a result of the decentralization, procedures on how to implement ethics programs differ at the department. `` For example, some components' procedures for reviewing public financial disclosure reports were more comprehensive than others,'' the report said. Moreover, <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> `` has not periodically evaluated the ethics program and not all of the Justice components have provided formal ethics training.'' Without proper evaluation, department officials are unable to determine if various divisions are `` properly reviewing and certifying public financial disclosure reports,'' the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said.

 Police arrested 25 city parking authority workers in breaking up a ring that bilked <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> out of up to $ 3.1 million in parking meter receipts over two years, authorities said. Police said Wednesday they discovered nearly two tons of one-franc and two-franc coins, worth about 15 and 30 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cents, hidden in a house in the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> region on Tuesday. The arrests were made Tuesday and Wednesday, and more may come later, authorities said. <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> has had pay parking since 1971. The individual meters, however, have been phased out and replaced by about 6,000 coin-operated machines that provide timed cards which drivers display inside the windshield of their vehicles.

<HEAD>EPA Calls For Strict Dumpsite Regulations to Protect Groundwater
Supplies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOELLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The long arm of the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> is reaching out to the local town dump _ and the huge metropolitan landfill as well. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>, in its first major effort to regulate the land disposal of household trash and garbage, is proposing rules that officials say would force nearly every municipal dump to take steps to protect the environment. Announced Wednesday, the plan would require all of the nation's municipal solid waste landfills to install often-expensive monitoring equipment to detect pollution of groundwater supplies The proposal, not expected to be popular with local governments, would require the cleaning up of dumps found to be leaking contaminants into underground aquifers. The draft regulations would force operators to put waterproof covers over dumps when they are closed and would set restrictions on where a new dump can be located. Many dumps that open after the rules take effect, probably not before 1991, would have to install bottom liners to prevent leakage and have systems to collect the polluting liquids found in dumps. `` It's a very strong protective rule,'' said <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>, assistant <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> administrator for solid waste and emergency response. `` In some cases, people are going to have to spend a lot of -LRB- compliance -RRB- money.'' The plan would leave many compliance details up to states, so long as a dump did not impose any greater danger to humans than a 1-in-10 ,000 chance of contracting cancer from water contaminated by a dump's leachate <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> told a news conference that states would have flexibility to operate their own compliance programs with an underlying proviso: `` We do n't care what you do, but you can not leak.'' The proposal would apply to an estimated 6,000 solid waste landfills _ 78 percent of them owned by local governments _ that handle about 80 percent of the 160 million tons of household refuse produced each year, he said. At least one of every four municipal dumps is believed to be violating one or more state groundwater-protection standards, he said. <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> said the dangers posed by municipal dumps can be seen in the `` Superfund'' priority cleanup list, where nearly one of every five facilities awaiting decontamination was once a municipal solid waste landfill. Around the nation, less than a third of the operating dumps have groundwater monitoring systems, only 15 percent have bottom liners and only 5 percent have leachate collection systems, according to <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>. `` Almost all landfills will have to do something,'' <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> said. `` There are very few landfills that meet all these requirements.'' He said he could not estimate precisely how much cost would be added to the nation's annual $ 4 billion to $ 5 billion bill for dumping, burning and recycling its trash and garbage. One EPA control scenario estimated the extra cost could reach $ 800 million a year, or about $ 11 per household. `` It will add something to the homeowner's bill,'' <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> said. `` We do n't think it will be dramatic.'' He said he expects positive reaction from states because they will have flexibility to structure their dump-control programs to meet particular hydrogeologic and topographical conditions. `` I think we'll get two other reactions: local governments will say this is too expensive and environmental groups will say it is n't strong enough,'' <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> said. He said the higher dump operating costs under the proposed rules could nudge local governments to make greater efforts to recycle trash, a move that could aid <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s national goal of recycling 25 percent of all household refuse. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> expects to take a year to obtain public comment on the proposal before making it final, <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> said. Dumps would then have 18 more months before they had to comply with the requirements. He said some dumps might close to evade the proposed rules, a move he acknowledged would leave them without leakproof covers unless they are in one of the handful of states that now require them.

 World output of poultry meat is up 3 percent this year and is expected to gain further in 1989, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. A survey of 51 major producing countries by the department's <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> released Wednesday showed 1988 poultry meat production at 30.12 million metric tons, up from 29.21 million last year The forecast for 1989 is for 31.09 million tons. The <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> account for most of this year's increase, while <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> will be a major contributor in 1989, the report said. Six countries in addition to the 12-nation EEC account for 23.1 million tons of this year's poultry meat total and 23.8 million tons of the 1989 forecast. Looking at the 1989 forecast, the report showed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> production at 9.79 million tons; <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, 2 million; <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, 700,000; <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>, 6.01 million; <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, 500,000; <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, 3.3 million; and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, 1.5 million. Other countries, not listed, are expected to account for 7.29 million tons of the 1989 forecast of 31.09 million tons. World egg production is expected to be up 1 percent this year, with the largest increase in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Production is expected to grow more slowly in 1989, the report said. In a related report, the department said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> egg production in July dropped 2 percent from a year earlier to 5.68 billion eggs. The total number of laying hens declined to 268 million birds, down 3 percent from July 1987.

<TEXT>
 Federal regulators hope to put on `` the back burner'' claims that some <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> seat belts can cause crippling injuries, an attorney representing a paraplegic child's family alleges The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> opened an investigation Wednesday into 1.7 million Ford Escort and Mercury Lynx cars to determine if the rear seat belts are safe. The agency turned down a request by the child's family that the cars be recalled immediately. `` Everything I know tells me that study on top of study means finesse,'' said <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakayan </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> attorney for the family of <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON>, who was crippled at age 11 in the 1985 crash of a Ford Escort. `` It puts it on the back burner for awhile.'' He accused the agency of seeking to placate congressional critics while deferring action on the issue until after the next president is inaugurated. <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> in January filed a petition for recall of the 1984-1988 cars on behalf of the child's parents, <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> and <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> of <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plata </LOCATION>, Md. The couple alleged a strap retainer caused the seat belt to ride around their child's waist rather than the hips. When the car in which they were riding smashed head-on into a tractor-trailer, the seat belt cut through the soft tissue to their son's spine, they said. The Garretts in January won a $ 3.3 million judgment against <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> for their child's injuries. <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> said in a letter to the <ORGANIZATION> Garretts </ORGANIZATION>' attorneys that a limited technical review had left the agency `` unable to conclude that the strap retainer has had an adverse effect on the performance of the system.'' The agency said the Lynx and Escort seat belts met federal safety standards, but added, `` Testing did indicate that the ... rear safety belts with and without the strap retainer fit differently on test subjects compared to rear safety belts in some other cars.'' The agency ordered a mid-level investigation, an engineering analysis, to probe the safety effects of the belts' fit. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said it believes the belts are safe. `` They meet or exceed all federal motor vehicle safety standard performance requirements, including those for location, fit, strength and ease of use,'' <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said. `` We are confident that the agency, too, will conclude that no safety-related defect is involved,'' <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said. In the 1985 accident, near <LOCATION> Annapolis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, a second back-seat passenger, 14-year-old <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaboury </PERSON>, was killed. The two front-seat occupants were hospitalized after the accident but escaped crippling injury, even though the passenger compartment crumpled in the collision. The accident and subsequent lawsuit prompted public questioning of the safety of rear-seat safety belts, particularly those with the unusual design found in the Escort and <ORGANIZATION> Lynx </ORGANIZATION>. Belts that ride against the hips are braced on a large mass of bone in an accident, keeping the passenger anchored while avoiding damage to the spine. Belts that ride above the hip under the impact of a crash can slice through the body's soft tissue to the spine, resulting in paralysis or death. <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> said its strong recommendation that seat belts be used remains unchanged. `` Whether it be at the front or the rear, ... you are far better off wearing any kind of belt than no belt at all, and that is based on studies of hundreds of thousands of accidents and fatalities and injuries,'' said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> DeFore </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman.

<HEAD>Plants `Crying' Out for Water</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 This summer's drought has caused plants literally to `` cry'' out for water as they wither, and scientists are trying to determine if their sounds _ too highly pitched for the human ear _ are attracting destructive insects. Department researchers have been using electronic gadgets for more than four years to hear corn and other drought-stressed plants make noises as cell structures, or water tubes, break down from a lack of water traveling from roots to the leaves. When there is adequate water in the soil, the water and nutrients flow upward in the tubes under tension. If the soil lacks enough water, the tension becomes too great and the tubes fracture. One potential benefit from this kind of research would be new ways of letting irrigation farmers know precisely when to water their fields. Also it could aid in developing new plant varieties, which would be better equipped to move water and nutrients from roots to leaves. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Haack </PERSON>, an entomologist at the department's North Central Forest Experiment Station, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lansing </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, and a colleague, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Mattson </PERSON>, think there might be a connection between the noises and flocking of some insects, such as bark beetles, to drought-damaged trees. The noises are called ultrasonic acoustic emissions, and are in the 100-kilohertz range, while sound heard by humans is no more than about 20 kilohertz. While the ultrasonic emissions have been documented, their role in attracting insects remains only an educated guess. <PERSON> Haack </PERSON>, the research leader, said in a telephone interview Wednesday from his East Lansing office, that he thought it was `` a neat idea'' that the noises of stricken trees might attract insects. `` We're just starting up'' on the tree-insect project, he said. `` We do n't have enough to make any speculation on what we might find.'' <PERSON> Haack </PERSON> said insects have been known for a long time to be attracted by certain influences such as color and scent. But <PERSON> Haack </PERSON> said that to the best of his knowledge there has not been conclusive work linking the ultrasound of trees to insect behavior. The project only got under way three weeks ago, he said. A lot of time has been spent rounding up necessary equipment, part of it borrowed from other laboratories near <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> State University, where the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> operation is located. `` It could turn out that these sounds do attract insects,'' <PERSON> Haack </PERSON> said. `` Or it might not ... or it might be a combination of things.'' In any case, <PERSON> Haack </PERSON> is starting by depriving potted white pine seedlings of water and recording their ultrasounds. The next step will be to see if the recorded sounds attract beetles. Eventually, <PERSON> Haack </PERSON> hopes to see what role the tree sounds play in the choice of sites for beetles to mate and lay eggs.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> came to the defense of <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> by claiming that the junior senator from <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> has more experience on military issues than Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, appearing Wednesday at a rally with Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, offered his lengthiest comments to date about <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> since the vice president tapped the 41-year-old last week as his running mate. Since the announcement was made, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> have been dogged by questions about the conservative senator's use of family connections to help him join the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and avoid the draft when many young Americans were being sent into combat in the Vietnam War. Although <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> made no mention of the flap, he opened his remarks by praising <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and adding, `` I like your running mate, too. `` He has had many more years of experience dealing with national security affairs than the head of the other ticket,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. The president lauded <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s work on a major job training bill without mentioning that Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., co-sponsored the measure `` <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> stands for the same principles as <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and I do,'' the president said. `` And he has the most important qualification of all for a co-pilot _ he wo n't be trying to turn the plane in one direction while the pilot is flying it in the other.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> argued that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is well-prepared for the presidency after eight years in the co-pilot's seat. `` I once said that he is a great vice president, but I know and I've seen that it did n't come easily. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is a man of action _ a man accustomed to command,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. The president offered no examples of duties he'd handed the vice president, but said that `` day in, day out, I've sought <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s counsel.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, as he has in several campaign appearances here amidst his annual August vacation in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, poked fun at the Democratic ticket, calling it `` a three-headed ticket that does n't know left from center. The president has often referred to the Democrats as running a triumvirate for the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, attempting to paint <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> as an unseen but powerful force in the campaign of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and his running mate Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>.

 Rival presidential candidates <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> are saying they want to debate this fall but sound far from agreement on when or where or how often they will meet. `` Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will debate his opponent this fall,'' said a brief statement Wednesday from the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign. But the announcement also said it was `` unlikely that a debate can occur prior to Sept. 20.'' That brought an outraged reaction from <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON>, who accused the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign of `` seeking to unilaterally reject'' debates scheduled for Sept. 8 in <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, and Sept. 14, in <LOCATION> Annapolis </LOCATION>, Md. <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign decision not to accept the earlier dates `` threatens the full schedule of debates anticipated for the fall. It is a transparent effort to limit the number of debates.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, during a stop in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, said flatly, `` I'm going to be in <LOCATION> Annapolis </LOCATION> on the 14th with or without him.'' The <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> debate is being sponsored by the League of Women Voters, the <LOCATION> Annapolis </LOCATION> forum by the bipartisan <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Presidential Debates. A <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spokesman said that while the Republican presidential nominee had said long ago he would debate his Democratic opponent, he had never agreed to any specific events. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> is expected to meet with <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> next week to negotiate the debate format. The campaign statement said they would discuss `` sponsorship, timing, ground rules and other related matters.'' The announcement said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aides were confident `` the two campaigns would be able to work out the details of the debate schedule between themselves.'' It also said the campaign `` thanked the groups and organizations which had offered to help expedite the process.'' <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> retorted: `` Mr. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> stated that the campaign is not prepared for a debate prior to Sept. 20. This is inexcusable. The presidential commission debates have been scheduled for over a year and the vice president has known he would be his party's nominee for more than five months. ... `` The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people have a right to the full schedule of these debates as agreed upon by the two national political parties.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> added during a campaign stop in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>: `` After seven years of on-the-job training, it seems to me that he ought to be able to go to work and debate the issues. ... The vice president has been saying a lot about defense and national security, and I'm ready to debate him. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodin </PERSON> said: `` There were never any commitments made on specifics of a debate schedule.

Union political operatives said the first step in their campaign for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is to make sure that 85 percent to 90 percent of union members and other voters in their families are registered, compared with 72 percent of the voting age population as a whole in the last presidential election. `` You need about six weeks in most states to have an effective drive,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON>, the labor federation's political director. <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON> will head the effort using computers at <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> headquarters here. The next step will use computers to track individual members' concerns on various issues, with letters sent to them on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' position on those The aim is to obtain at least 65 percent to 70 percent turnout Nov. 8. <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> estimated the federation's endorsement of <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> in 1984 was worth a net 2 million votes despite exit polls showing that as many as 47 percent of voters from union households cast their ballots for President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` Our rule of thumb is that we have to do two-thirds or better in order to be successful in the election,'' <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> said. `` We fell short of that. I'm reasonably confident that the results this time will be improved.'' <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said winning passage of a law requiring employers to give 60 days advance notice of plant closings and layoffs has renewed labor's confidence going into the campaign's final 11 weeks. `` In the primaries, we had our members running -LRB- as potential delegates to national conventions -RRB- on behalf of every <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidate, but we have a very united position now in the <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>, and my sense is it's that way across the labor movement,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> <PERSON> Bieber </PERSON>, the president of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>, said a poll of his members by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arbitration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> showed a 96.9 percent level of support for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` And that was before <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Bieber </PERSON> said, referring to the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator tapped last week as the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nominee and the controversy since then on his use of family connections to help him avoid the Vietnam War draft. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> led the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's opposition on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> to the plant closing notices law and has one of the lowest pro-labor voting records _ 9 percent _ in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Labor leaders acknowledged that an overwhelming majority of their rank-and-file probably are unaware of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s role in defeating union-sought labor legislation over the past seven years. One of their missions between now and Election Day, they said, is to educate their members on <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s votes. `` At this point I just hope he's not forced off the ticket,'' <PERSON> Rachelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Horowitz </PERSON>, political director for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION>, said of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. `` I want him out there campaigning.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodin </PERSON> called the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>'s endorsement of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` a classic dog bites man story. `` Every four years the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> trots out what has become an obligatory endorsement of a Democratic presidential candidate and 1988 is obviously no exception,'' <PERSON> Goodin </PERSON> said. Among those unions abstaining in Wednesday's endorsement was the largest, the 1.6 million-member Teamsters, which endorsed <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in 1980 and 1984 after making no presidential endorsement in 1976. Newly installed Teamster President <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, who according to union sources dislikes <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, said he is withholding an endorsement until a mail poll of his members is completed Sept. 16. Asked if the Teamsters might endorse <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, a union official said, `` I just do n't see it.'' `` If the poll comes back strong for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, we'll probably endorse him,'' said the Teamster official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. `` If it's close, we'll probably remain neutral.'' The 30,000-member <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said it was delaying an endorsement until after its convention next month. The 40,000-member <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> union also voted to abstain, reaffirming its decades-old policy of making no presidential endorsements. The Newspaper Guild qualified its endorsement, voting 4,000 of its 25,390 members as abstaining primarily because of opposition by its 1,000-member <ORGANIZATION> Wire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> local to taking sides in the election.

<HEAD>US, Soviets Agree to Extend Grain Deal</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> have agreed tentatively to extend their grain deal for another year while trying to complete a new, longer-range accord, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official says. The official, who asked not to be identified, said Wednesday that the two countries agreed through diplomatic channels last week on an extension that is essentially identical to the current pact. A second official insisted that no final agreement had been reached, but said he believed that one could be completed shortly. `` We feel like we made some progress, but we're still far apart on pricing, minimums and things of that nature,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Kay </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said of the first three U.S.-Soviet negotiating sessions. <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> said the two countries are trying to schedule a fourth meeting. `` I'm optimistic at the next session we'll reach an agreement,'' he said. Under the current five-year pact, which expires Sept. 30, the Soviets must buy at least 9 million tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain annually. The grain deal benefits American farmers, now experiencing severe drought problems, and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, which often looks to the West for grain even though it has had a good harvest this year. Last month, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> estimated that the Soviets would have a bumper harvest of 215 million metric tons, which would be their third best crop ever. The Soviets are importing grain to build up their stockpiles and to feed expanding livestock herds. The Soviets already have been given permission to purchase more than 12 million tons of grain for this year. As of last month, they had bought more than 5 million tons of corn, more than 9 million tons of wheat, 830,700 tons of soybeans and 1.3 million tons of soybean meal.

<HEAD>Government Sets Trials For New AIDS Vaccine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A genetically engineered AIDS vaccine made with the virus used in smallpox vaccinations soon will be tested on volunteers at six university medical centers, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Allergy </ORGANIZATION> and Infectious Diseases says. Each of the medical centers will recruit nine volunteers to first determine the vaccine's safety and its ability to produce an immune response. There is no chance of contracting AIDS from the vaccine since it contains no live or killed human immunodeficiency virus that causes the deadly disease, the institute said Wednesday. The volunteers must be healthy men or women who pass a blood test showing they are not infected with the virus that causes AIDS and `` who are not engaged in behavior that would place them at high risk of contracting HIV,'' the institute said. While the institute is conducting numerous research projects to find effective drugs to treat HIV victims, this is only the second vaccine to be approved for testing. The first study began a year ago. `` We are quite a distance away from getting a vaccine that would be approved for general use,'' said <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Baldwin </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the institute. `` It is estimated we will not have an AIDS vaccine until the mid-1990s.'' The vaccine is produced by using live vaccinia virus, which has been used for years as a smallpox vaccination. That disease has now been wiped out worldwide. At each of the six centers, six volunteers will receive the AIDS vaccine and three will receive vaccinia vaccine alone, as a control. Neither the volunteers nor the physicians conducting the test will know which vaccine each person is receiving until data is analyzed. The medical centers that will conduct the studies are the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Vanderbilt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rochester </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> -RRB-; <ORGANIZATION> Baylor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>; and <ORGANIZATION> Marshall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>. Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome attacks the body's immune system, rendering it incapable of resisting other diseases and AIDS most often is spread through close contact with blood, blood products or semen from infected persons. Its chief victims have been homosexual men and intravenous drug users. As of Monday, AIDS had been diagnosed in 71,171 Americans, of whom more than half, or 40,090, have died, according to the federal <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>. No one is known to have recovered from AIDS.

<TEXT>
 A deputy police chief resigned under fire Wednesday as the police commissioner issued a report blaming him and other brass for a riot at a park that led to 100 complaints of police brutality. Deputy Chief <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Darcy </PERSON>, a 31-year police veteran, commanded hundreds of police officers who were deployed to defuse a demonstration at Tompkins Square Park on <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Lower </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION> on Aug. 6. The demonstration _ against a 1 a.m. curfew at the park _ turned violent and more than 50 people were hurt in clashes between police and protesters. More than 100 charges of police brutality were later filed with the Civilian Complaint Review Board. Commissioner <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>'s report said a lack of supervision was responsible for `` the appalling behavior of some members of the department.'' `` The control of the situation was lost during the first confrontation between police and demonstrators and never sufficiently regained,'' wrote Chief of Department <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, who prepared the 16-page report. `` For this Chief <PERSON> Darcy </PERSON>, the highest-ranking member of the department at the scene, must be held accountable.'' The other two supervisory officers at the confrontation, Deputy Inspector <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Wodarski </PERSON> and Capt. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON>, also were disciplined. <PERSON> Wodarski </PERSON> was the ranking officer at the scene during a crucial period when <PERSON> Darcy </PERSON> returned to his office about a dozen blocks away to go to the bathroom, but he deferred all major decisions to <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON>. `` Unfortunately,'' the report said, `` Capt. <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON>'s actions were not well planned, staffed, supervised or executed. Unnecessary confrontations resulted, which culminated in a riot.'' A key mistake, according to <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, was <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON>'s decision, at the beginning of the demonstration, to transmit an emergency signal that mobilized 300 police officers from all over the city without making any provisions for adequate supervision of the officers. Even after <PERSON> Darcy </PERSON> returned to the park, the mobilization call was never taken off the air. As a result, officers continued to pour into the area, further confusing the situation, <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Wodarski </PERSON> was reassigned from his prestigious post as commanding officer of the Midtown South Precinct to another, as a command in <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION>. <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON> will be temporarily removed from his job commanding the 9th Precinct for a six - to seven-month retraining period, <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said During that time, the East Village Precinct house will be placed under the command of Inspector <PERSON> Elson </PERSON> <PERSON> Gelfand </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Civilian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Complaint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> has already identified several officers involved in the melee, relying in part on videotapes taken by neighborhood residents. The videotapes show police officers, some of whom covered or removed their badges, striking demonstrators for no apparent reason. The board recommended that charges be brought against two officers, both of whom were placed on modified assignment Wednesday pending outcome of a departmental trial. <PERSON> Darcy </PERSON>, 56, had been criticized anonymously shortly after the riot when <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> cited the decision by the ranking officer at the park to leave the scene to go to the bathroom at a crucial moment. The commissioner had said that was one of 10 mistakes that led to the melee. <PERSON> Darcy </PERSON> was trained in crowd control during the 1960s as a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Tactical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> was widely praised in those years for developing tactics that helped the city avoid the wide-scale civil disorder that plagued many other big cities.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> lotto machine that selects winning numbers jammed Wednesday night during a drawing for a $ 38 million jackpot, one of the nation's largest gambling windfalls. Lottery officials, following disaster recovery guidelines, hastily conducted another televised drawing a half hour after the regular time. `` There are procedures to handle this sort of thing and they were followed,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, the lottery's top spokesman at <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> headquarters. The first, incomplete drawing was ruled invalid, <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said. A drawing announcer called out the number 33 during the initial drawing but no ball bearing the number rolled out of the machine. At the outset of the second drawing, the announcer said, `` We've reloaded the machine and are beginning a new drawing. The reason the device failed was still being investigated, lottery officials said. It was the first failure in the 22-month history of the game. Before the first drawing, Californians were grabbing $ 1 lotto tickets at an estimated average rate of more than 500 a second. `` The lines are unreal. People who normally buy $ 5 worth of tickets are buying $ 20 worth,'' said <LOCATION> Anaheim </LOCATION> liquor store owner <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Notery </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON> `` Anybody with money to spend is thinking, nothing ventured, nothing gained.'' The fast pace of sales left lottery officials unsure of the exact jackpot total. Officials expected to determine Thursday whether there was a winner, and verify that person's identity later. If nobody picked the correct six numbers out of a choice of 49 numbers, the jackpot will be added to Saturday's drawing, said officials.

<TEXT>
 Mayor <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> <PERSON> Goode </PERSON> circumvented the city prison board and ordered condoms distributed to inmates as part of an AIDS prevention program in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> jails. On Monday, the board voted 3-2 with one abstention against making condoms available to prisoners, despite pleas from health officials and testimony from an inmate suffering from the deadly disease. <PERSON> Goode </PERSON> said Wednesday his program, which takes effect Sept. 1, also includes anonymous AIDS testing, counseling and treatment of prisoners. Prison board member <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendel </PERSON>, an attorney who strongly opposes distributing condoms, said <PERSON> Goode </PERSON> had the prerogative to circumvent the board. <PERSON> Mendel </PERSON> said he opposed the proposal because the law prohibits sex between prisoners. `` We're sending mixed signals,'' he said. He also said he doubted that prisoners will use the condoms, especially in cases of rape. `` A prisoner with AIDS is an animal'' who would not care whether his sex partner has protection from the disease, <PERSON> Mendel </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mendel </PERSON> said only eight prisoners in the city's jails have been diagnosed as having acquired immune deficiency syndrome, indicating that `` prisons are not AIDS factories.'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Fair </PERSON>, director of AIDS programs for the city <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, said earlier this week that two prisoners have died from the disease. He said the number of prisoners infected with the AIDS virus would be difficult to estimate but could total more than half of the 3,700 in custody. During a two-hour discussion before Monday night's vote, <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> urged approval of the policy, saying sexual activity was rampant in the city's jails. `` We are not condoning sexual activity,'' <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> said. `` We are saying it is taking place ... and the best protection against AIDS is using a condom.''

<HEAD>Ursula Meese's China Travel Prompts Clarification of Justice Trip

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> should not have allowed former Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>'s wife to accept a free trip to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> last year, the Office of Government Ethics says. `` The bottom line is, if the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> considers it an official function, then the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> must pick up the tab for its own employees,'' said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, a spokesman at the ethics office. <PERSON> Ursula </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> accepted the all-expenses-paid trip as a guest of People-To-People International of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, a non-profit organization. She and <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, the wife of <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, head of the office of liaison services, accompanied their husbands to an international legal seminar after <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> officials said it was proper for them to do so, <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> said. `` We disagreed with them in the outcome,'' <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> said. `` They analyzed it, and they saw it a little bit differently than we did.'' Federal regulations prohibit relatives of federal employees from accepting trips and gifts. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> paid for travel by the attorney general and other department employees. The ethics office plans no more action, <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> said, terming the decision on the <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> trip `` a close call,'' but the office has sent a letter to Justice spelling out how similar trips should be handled in the future. Five Justice officials, along with <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> _ who resigned Aug. 12 and is now a private citizen _ plan to attend a similar legal conference in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> between Aug. 29-Sept. 1 `` What we basically said was that we are not going to challenge anything on the <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> trip, but here is guidance for the <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> trip,'' <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> said. The Justice employees who are traveling to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> are <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Korten </PERSON>, the department's chief spokesman; <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Rule </PERSON>, assistant attorney general for antitrust; <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> of the liaison office; <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Nolan </PERSON>, one of <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>' subordinates, and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Abell </PERSON>, director of the office of Justice programs. Mrs. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> is not scheduled to go on the trip, a secretary in <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>' office said. <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Burstion-Wade </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, said the conference is designed to explore legal and economic relations between <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Republican Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, whose candidacy for the vice presidency has been dogged by controversy, should be thankful he's not being ignored, say Republican legislators. `` They say that as an elected official, even bad press is good press,'' said state Delegate <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Klima </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Lutherville </LOCATION>, Md. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, who spoke to the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday, was unanimously endorsed by fellow Republicans, who said his troubles actually may help him in the long run. `` It has added to the party and I want to thank the press,'' said <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> Delegate <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Martinsville </LOCATION>. `` It's inviting more questions, and I think the exposure's good. It was one of the first appearances <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has made on his own on the campaign trail since his selection by <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential nominee <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The most persistent questions have been about whether he used his family's influence to gain a spot in 1969 in the <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> to avoid a tour in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Crestview </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> said the publicity has turned what would have been a two-month job of introducing the relatively unknown <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> to the public into a free advertising campaign. `` It's taken a person who was not well-known and made him a household word,'' <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> said. Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential running mate of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, preceded <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> on the platform before the Southern lawmakers. Other Southern <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> lawmakers said the attention focused on <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has taken away from the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> ticket. `` I think anytime you spend a lot of time about an ancillary issue ... obviously it's divisive,'' said <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> state Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hainkel </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. `` It has n't been good because it's taken the spotlight off the things we ought to be talking about.'' <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> state Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Strong </PERSON> of Hazard agreed, saying, `` It's kind of stymied the ticket It's dominated the news where <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ca n't get his message across.'' <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> state Sen. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Tysinger </PERSON> of <LOCATION> DeKalb </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> said the Democratic ticket also has suffered by the attention paid to <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. `` It has hurt both of them,'' <PERSON> Tysinger </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has n't been in the news and neither has <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. No Republican said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s problems are serious enough to warrant his dismissal from the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> ticket. `` I think it would be terrible to take him off the ticket,'' said <PERSON> Hainkel </PERSON>. `` If I was <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, I would n't even consider that. You'd infuriate every man who ever served in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> for one thing.'' Many lawmakers thought the news media would suffer the consequences of a backlash if they continued to harp on <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s service in the National Guard There was unanimous agreement that enough had been said about the subject. `` It's detracted from what the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people need to know,'' said <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> state Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moody </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Morristown </LOCATION>. `` Maybe we can get on to some of the campaign issues now,'' added <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Klima </PERSON>.

 It's one thing getting filmgoers to watch the make-believe violence of a `` Nightmare on Elm Street.'' It's another luring them to witness a true-to-life racial lynching that mirrors the sickness of their society Yet that's the challenge facing the makers of the explosive movie `` Betrayed,'' which opens in theaters across the country on Friday but has already suffered one advertising snafu that left preview audiences steaming. Filled with unbridled bigotry and an all-too-real racial murder, the film stands as a study in how _ and how not _ to market an earthshaker. `` This movie is enormously difficult,'' says <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON>, who is supervising the advertising campaign. `` This is a very tough, tough film.'' What makes `` Betrayed,'' directed by <ORGANIZATION> Costa-Gavras </ORGANIZATION>, a hard sell is its explicit depiction of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> white supremacists _ a topic audiences might want to avoid. So producer <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Artists </ORGANIZATION> looked for another marketing hook within the movie. Cut to Debra Winger and <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Berenger </PERSON>, the film's stars. For <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Artists </ORGANIZATION>, the popular pair made for a natural advertising angle. Thus, in the first `` Betrayed'' posters, or `` one sheets'' as they are called, Winger and <PERSON> Berenger </PERSON> were shown embracing. From the looks of the poster, `` Betrayed'' appeared to be a steamy little film, perhaps an update of `` Jagged Edge,'' which was, in fact, written by `` Betrayed'' author <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Eszterhas </PERSON>. But preview audiences expecting `` Betrayed'' to resemble an adventure-packed pulp romance were startled to see a band of hard-working Midwestern farmers who lead a double life as racist killers. The white supremacists murder a talk-show host reminiscent of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> radio personality <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Berg </PERSON>, who was gunned down in 1985 by members of The Order. They hunt down and lynch a black youth and denounce homosexuals, Jews and various ethnic groups. In more than one instance, preview audience members spontaneously erupted in anger, either walking out or speaking out against the film while it was still on screen. Said one woman at a Century City screening: `` All white people are not like that!'' The time was ripe, it seemed, for a new advertising campaign _ the film's future hung in the balance. `` What we found out was that people did n't know how to react to this film,'' said <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrier </PERSON>, who with <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON> was called in to consult on the $ 6 million advertising campaign. `` We had to help the audience along and say, ` It is going to be an upsetting film. It is not going to be a musical,''' <PERSON> Farrier </PERSON> said. The decision was ironic: If the movie were to be popular, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Artists </ORGANIZATION> was saying, people had to be ready to hate what they saw. `` Powerful films do cause people to say, ` I do n't want to see this. ... It makes me uncomfortable.' That's the risk that you run,'' said <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomopoulos </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Artists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Costa-Gavras </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> director, has made a career specializing in disturbing films such as `` Missing,'' `` State of Siege'' and `` Z.'' `` When we first started screening the film for people,'' <PERSON> Thomopoulos </PERSON> said, `` we found out that if people were not prepared for what they were going to see, their reaction was so shocked that they were n't able to digest it all, and they missed a great deal of the film. Now we are taking this approach of making people aware.'' Among the first moves that <PERSON> Farrier </PERSON> and <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON> made was dropping the sexually tinged poster, which was to have been used as a newspaper advertisement. The poster was replaced with an unusual, unillustrated full-page ad that ran in newspapers in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> _ but in the hard-news, not entertainment sections. The movie, the ad said, is `` a profoundly disturbing and often shocking motion picture portrait of a hidden part of contemporary <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. It will anger you. It will upset you.'' A new television ad, which began the first week of August, was just as blunt: `` It will change the way you think ... forever.'' Soon, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Artists </ORGANIZATION> introduced a television commercial built around interviews with average-looking moviegoers leaving screenings. Said one: `` The movie was terrifying.'' Said another: `` It will kick you in the rear end.'' After that ad ran, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Artists </ORGANIZATION> finally began running commercials that addressed the entire storyline, and Winger and <PERSON> Berenger </PERSON> were finally revealed to be lovers. While reviews and box-office receipts will ultimately prove whether `` Betrayed'' is an interesting movie, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Artists </ORGANIZATION> has, at least, set the stage. Said Weaver: `` All we can do now is wait.''

 French director <PERSON> Costa-Gavras </PERSON> admits he has a knack for hitting sensitive nerves with his films about political repression, but he's fascinated by what he sees as dualism in American society. His latest movie, `` Betrayed,'' examines racist paramilitary groups in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and is likely to come under siege itself for its depiction of hard-working Midwestern farmers who lead a double life as racist killers. `` As an outsider, that's what fascinates me _ and confuses me _ about this country,'' the 55-year-old director said in a recent interview. `` You have racism here, especially against outsiders, yet you can have a presidential candidate who is Greek boy with a Jewish wife. `` You have worked so hard to fight totalitarianism and keep your democracy, yet your government supports dictators.'' <PERSON> Costa-Gavras </PERSON> also filmed `` Missing,'' about a right-wing dictatorship in <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>. Conservative columnist <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Will </PERSON> called the story about a young American who disappeared during the coup that brought Gen. <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> to power `` a fraud'' and `` a hit' n run act of cowardice.'' In `` State of Siege,'' an earlier film shot in <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> during the regime of Marxist president <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Allende </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Costa-Gavras </ORGANIZATION> offended the left wing. The <ORGANIZATION> Chilean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> refused to cooperate in making the film, and pro-communist actors quit during the filming, claiming the movie was pro-CIA. `` You have to understand that people of my generation thought we knew the truth _ the only right way. We learned the hard way that it was n't so easy,'' said the Greek-born <PERSON> Costa-Gavras </PERSON>, who now lives in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. `` So when I make movies, I feel it's absolutely important to be critical of everyone.

<HEAD>Reports: Spy Network Stole Secret Western Military Documents</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 West European authorities detained eight people involved in a spy ring that supplied the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> with secret military documents for at least 10 years, according to published reports. Principals in the newly uncovered ring, which operated through a German-Hungarian connection, caused a major security loss to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the late 1970s, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported today. Officials refused to describe the loss, the Times said. Senior officials at the Pentagon and the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> learned about the espionage network in the last few days, the newspaper said. Documents concerning <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> defense plans for <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> were believed stolen as well as the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> contingency plans for a ground war in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> against the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the newspaper said. Investigators told the Times they believe that the West German-based spy ring, aided by couriers in neutral <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, provided documents apparently obtained from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers to the intelligence agency of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, a Soviet ally. The network was uncovered by West German and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, including agents from the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, the Times said. The Army has about 250,000 military personnel in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> at more than 200 installations. The Times said officials did not know how long the network had been operating. The newspaper quoted unidentified <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials as saying authorities in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> detained eight people on Tuesday but that some were brought in only for questioning. Those detained included a retired <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> sergeant who has been living in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the Times said. Names of those involved and further details of the case have not been made public. National Swedish television reported Wednesday that security police in <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION> arrested three Swedes suspected of spying for an East European country. The two men and a woman were detained Tuesday in the southwestern port city of <LOCATION> Goteborg </LOCATION> and Chief Public Prosecutor <PERSON> Sven-Olof </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakansson </PERSON> was to ask a court to arraign them today, the report said. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement, `` We understand that there has been an apprehension by West German authorities, but do not consider it appropriate to comment at this time. `` Our policy is not to comment on ongoing, sensitive investigations, particularly when they involve an allied government,'' said <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman.

 Here, at a glance, are the main issues to be discussed in the Iran-Iraq cease-fire talks opening today:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>PRISONERS OF WAR</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>'s cease-fire Resolution 598 urges that the POWs `` be released and repatriated without delay after the cessation of active hostilities'' in accordance with the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> conventions. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>, who sent a special mission to the two countries to inquire into the POW situation, says the actual figure is more than 80,000. The all-Swiss <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> which supervises observance of the Geneva Conventions has registered 50,182 POWs in Iranian camps and 19,284 POWs in Iraqi camps. Many of the POWs on both sides are expected to refuse repatriation because they have supported publicly the detaining power. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, which is expected to organize the repatriation, says it will accept the mandate only if it has access to every prisoner to make sure he agrees to repatriation.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>WAR GUILT</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Resolution 598 envisions establishment of an `` impartial body'' to investigate the `` responsibility for the conflict.'' <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> invaded <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> Sept. 22, 1980, after weeks of border skirmishes and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> expects <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> to be branded as the aggressor. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> says it acted after assassination attempts against its leaders by pro-Iranian extremists and Iranian calls for the overthrow of the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> leadership.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>BORDERS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Resolution 598 refers to the withdrawal of all forces `` to the internationally recognized borders without delay.'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> holds that the 737 - mile common border was delineated in a treaty concluded in 1975 between the two countries during the rule of <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> <PERSON> Reza </PERSON> <PERSON> Pahlavi </PERSON> In particular, that treaty granted <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> its long-sought claim to the eastern half of the 127-mile <PERSON> Shatt </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Arab </PERSON>, the confluence of the Euphrates and <LOCATION> Tigris </LOCATION> rivers and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s only access to the open sea. That waterway has been the subject of border disputes for centuries. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> unilaterally repudiated the 1975 treaty on Sept. 17, 1980, five days before its forces crossed into <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> called the waterway `` totally <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> and totally Arab.'' On Sept. 23, 1980, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> announced three territorial conditions for ending the war _ Iranian recognition of <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> claims to the entire waterway, to water rights to rivers flowing from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, and to three <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> islands seized by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in 1971.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>REPARATIONS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 In 1985, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> officially assessed the cost of its war damage as $ 350 billion and announced it would seek reparations. An Iranian newspaper earlier this month on estimated total losses due to the war at $ 600 billion. There has been no recent official claim by <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has not issued an official assessment of war damages. Resolution 598, which calls for a `` comprehensive, just and honorable settlement,'' makes no direct reference to reparations.

<TEXT>
 His 1962 novel `` The Graduate'' became a smash-hit movie evoking the discontent of a generation fed up with materialism. Today, however, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> finds himself looking for a handout. `` The things he stands for and believes in are principles he ca n't live by any longer,'' said <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>'s ex-wife <PERSON> Fred </PERSON>, who has accompanied him through two itinerant decades that has left the couple virtually homeless. <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, 49, says his abhorrence of material things led him to give away two houses during the good times. He says he is nearly destitute, living out of a van on a few thousand dollars a year. `` It's hard to make anybody believe the author of ` The Graduate' needs money,'' he said Wednesday <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> said hard times have driven him and his 48-year-old ex-wife out of the southern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> campground where they lived for the past decade to the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> town where <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> went to college 30 years ago. He came East, he said, in hopes of finding a publisher for his latest project, a compilation of writings on prejudice. His plight, however, has taken him to the welfare office in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Adams </LOCATION>, which rejected him because he has no permanent address. The novelist, whose hero in `` The Graduate,'' <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Braddock </PERSON>, struck a chord among young readers with his post-graduate misery at his parents' suburban home, has lived until now according to what friends consider impossibly high and even self-destructive standards. `` If he's hard up for dough, it's obviously due to ... his inclination toward divestiture,'' said <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, who graduated with <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> from <ORGANIZATION> Williams </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in 1961 and teaches at the private <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. He said the couple's tendency to rid themselves of property explains why they gave their <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> house to a real estate agent in the 1960s and a home to the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Audubon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> in 1970, when, <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> said, he felt the need for `` getting free of things.'' After the <ORGANIZATION> Webbs </ORGANIZATION>' marriage in 1962 in <PERSON> Fred </PERSON>'s posh hometown of <LOCATION> Lakeville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, they sold their wedding gifts at a yard sale, many of them to the guests who had given them. A yearning to be free also explains their decision to divorce eight years ago, although they had no intention of separating. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON>, an artist whom <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> met when she was a student at <ORGANIZATION> Bennington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, said the couple felt marriage was a violation of their constitutional right to freedom. <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, the son of a well-to-do <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> doctor, espoused odd views back in college, <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said. `` We always used to wonder whether <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> was putting us on,'' he said. `` He's quite sophisticated, a very intelligent person with a real heart, but he always said things that sounded peculiarly simple.'' <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> was the envy of classmates with the publication of `` The Graduate,'' which he wrote after his own graduation in a small apartment in <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION> that he rented with the help of a college creative writing grant. The obscure 1962 novel was catapulted to fame by the movie, and <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> was declared a highly gifted writer with a keen ear for dialogue. `` The Graduate'' was followed by four other novels, including `` The Marriage of A Young Stockbroker,'' which also was made into a movie. His last work, `` Booze,'' was published in 1978. <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> says he received only $ 20,000 for the film rights to `` The Graduate,'' which starred <PERSON> Dustin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>, in the days before authors insisted on a percentage of the movie's sales. The novel, however, is still in print and continues to earn a few thousand dollars in royalties annually. But he does n't regret the unusual life that led to his dilemma. `` It's hard to think there would be another way to do it,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 Protesters hoping to block plans for an archaeological dig at two Indian mounds kneeled around a colorful Indian prayer blanket and called on the Great Spirit for help. `` This is a spiritual issue. These grounds are sacred to Native Americans,'' said <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, regional director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christians </ORGANIZATION> and Jews. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> accompanied three <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> preachers and an Indian spiritual leader Wednesday as they joined a dozen other critics of the proposed dig. The mounds are all that remain of an Indian village that sat beside the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> about a thousand years ago. Protests led by several <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> who said the graves of their ancestors would be violated stopped a dig scheduled at the site in June by a <ORGANIZATION> Memphis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> professor and his students. Now, state officials are considering a dig at the mounds, but state archaeologist <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Fielder </PERSON> said the protesters do n't understand what he's up to `` Archaeologists are interested in seeing such sites preserved. We do n't have to be at odds,'' Fielder said. The state is trying to have the mounds registered as a national historic site, he said, and digs will be conducted only if required as part of that application. The mounds are not believed to contain graves, but if any are found, they will be left alone, Fielder said. However, protesters said the site is sacred to American Indians and should not be disturbed for any reason. `` Freedom of religion is as dear to these people as it is to me as a Baptist,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> W.C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>, pastor of <ORGANIZATION> Beulah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>, the other pastors and <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> joined with <PERSON> Rosemarie </PERSON> <PERSON> Abeita </PERSON>, an Indian spiritual leader from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, in the prayer beside the mounds. The group kneeled before an altar made of wood carvings, eagle feathers and other religious items. `` Make of us one people and help us recognize our common home of this Earth,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> <PERSON> Sehested </PERSON>, pastor of <ORGANIZATION> Prescott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. After their prayer, the demonstrators held hands in a circle, sang `` We Shall Overcome'' and recited the Lord's Prayer. Ms. <PERSON> Abeita </PERSON> said the mounds already have been disturbed too much over the years. They were used for fortifications during the Civil War, and 27 skeletons were dug up and removed from the mounds in the 1930s, she said. Fielder said the skeletons were uncovered by a work crew building a road, not by archaeologists. Placing the mounds on the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Register </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Historic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Places </ORGANIZATION> would prevent that sort of thing from happening again, he said.

<HEAD>New Evidence of Recovery From Acid Rain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Scientists who built a 1,400-square-yard roof to shield the ground from acid rain reported today their experiment gives new hope that lakes and streams can recover when such pollution stops. Acid rain, which results from certain kinds of man-made pollution, can harm fish, other aquatic life, vegetation, buildings and monuments. For the experiment, begun in 1984 and reported in the British journal <ORGANIZATION> Nature </ORGANIZATION>, Norwegian and Swedish researchers built the roof over a site in southern <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> that had been exposed to acid rain. Precipitation that fell on the roof was filtered to remove acid-rain components, then distributed beneath the roof by sprinklers. Analysis showed the runoff beneath the roof began to recover normal chemistry after the structure was built. That `` indicates that chemical changes caused by acid deposition are largely reversible,'' the researchers wrote. The results agree with previous studies from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, they said. Further studies of soil and runoff will be needed to see if they can completely recover from acid rain, they said.

 A witch doctor using a monkey as bait captured the companion of a notorious man-eating crocodile, but the 200-year-old killer croc remains at large, a newspaper said today. <PERSON> Bujang </PERSON> <PERSON> Sudin </PERSON>, a 16.4-foot long specimen weighing 397 pounds, was pulled from a river Saturday and sold to a nearby crocodile farm, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Straits </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said. The newspaper said the witch doctor, <PERSON> Bakir </PERSON> <PERSON> Alias </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeop </PERSON>, lured the crocodile with the monkey and chanted, `` Bujang Sudin come.'' It said two other men then helped haul the crocodile from the river. The report quoted <PERSON> Abang </PERSON> <PERSON> Adris </PERSON> <PERSON> Abang </PERSON> <PERSON> Suhai </PERSON>, a police official in <LOCATION> Sarawak </LOCATION> state, 540 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Kuala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lumpur </LOCATION>. Police said the people of <LOCATION> Sungai </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sadong </LOCATION> village in <LOCATION> Sarawak </LOCATION> had been complaining that a crocodile was troubling them and chasing them as they walked along the river bank. They wanted it caught. Police said they did not know if <PERSON> Bujang </PERSON> <PERSON> Sudin </PERSON> had eaten any humans. The crocodile's companion, however, has, and has been the subject of massive police hunts. He is Bujang Senang, which means `` easy-going bachelor'' in Malay, and he is believed to have been born about 200 years ago. <PERSON> Bujang </PERSON> <PERSON> Sudin </PERSON> means `` bachelor Sudin''. In 1984, <PERSON> Bujang </PERSON> <PERSON> Senang </PERSON> became famous in <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> when he killed a 51-year-old man who was in a boat near his home. On Aug. 2, 1982, the crocodile killed an 86-year-old man. Police sharpshooters scoured the rivers in an effort to track down the crocodile. Authorities called witch doctors from as far away as <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> to help. Police have stopped looking for Bujang Senang, although there have been occasional reports of him being sighted along various rivers.

<HEAD>New Evidence Found for Global Fire Contributing to Extinctions

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Ancient clay deposits provide evidence that a global fire contributed to widespread extinctions of dinosaurs and other life forms 65 million years ago, scientists reported today. The hypothesis, put forth in 1985, is that the fire was ignited by the impact of a huge meteorite. Some scientists say such an impact could have kicked up enough dust to block sunlight for a long time, triggering extinctions by lowering temperatures and killing vegetation. A worldwide fire could have added other dangers, <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> chemist <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Anders </PERSON> said Wednesday in a telephone interview. Apart from burning or choking in the flames, organisms could have perished from newly formed toxic compounds, or from an eventual warming of temperatures triggered by carbon monoxide the fire poured into the atmosphere, he said. The study, by <PERSON> Anders </PERSON> and others, appears in the British journal Nature and involved close examination of ancient clay samples from five sites in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>. Researchers found that carbon, thought to be from the soot, settled on the ground at about the time as particles of iridium, which are believed to have come from the meteorite. That suggests the fire was ignited by the impact, rather than occurring much later, <PERSON> Anders </PERSON> said. Analysis also showed uniformity in the types of carbon found at the sites, suggesting the carbon came from a single global fire, <PERSON> Anders </PERSON> said. Two sites show a particular type of hydrocarbon that may have come from the burning of coniferous trees, he said.

 More than half the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military families living in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> have moved onto American bases over the past five months, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials said.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s government on Thursday freed the country's top dissident and nine others arrested in a crackdown by former hard-line President <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>. A day earlier, the new president lifted martial law in the capital and called for a referendum on multiparty democracy. Those released included this correspondent, who on the drive home from Insein Jail saw for the first time in 26 years people shouting for democracy without any official hindrance. People of all ages, wearing red headbands symbolizing defiance, road in open trucks around the capital shouting, `` Give us democracy immediately!'' Banners hung across the roads said: `` We want democracy! We want a multiparty system!'' On Wednesday, President <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>, beseiged by mass street protests, said the ruling party soon will hold an emergency congress to consider popular demands for an end to authoritarian rule. <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>, in power for only a week, is the country's first civilian leader since military-dominated, one-party rule was instituted in 1962. This correspondent was arrested during July 29-30 raids that also netted leading dissident <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON> and others. The official government News Agency of <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> accused them of `` attacking the state.'' The demonstrations that led to <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>'s ouster after just 17 days in office left 112 people dead by official count and led to martial law being imposed in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>. A tourist said people danced in the streets of the capital on Wednesday when <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> ended martial law, ordered troops from the city center and lifted curfews throughout the country. <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s first civilian leader in 26 years, called for a popular vote on restoring multiparty democracy and said his government would resign if the ruling party rejects his plan. `` General elections will be held as soon as possible'' if the people approve a multiparty system, and no top government officials will run, the president said. <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> noted that Ne Win, who led the 1962 military coup that began authoritarian one-party rule in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>, proposed a referendum on multiparty government when he resigned July 23 but that members of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Burma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> rejected the proposal. The party leadership will meet again in the next month to consider the referendum again, he said. State-run <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rangoon </ORGANIZATION> said the party will meet Sept. 12. `` If the congress refuses to hold a referendum, I and ... the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Executive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> will resign from the party,'' said <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>, one of 14 members of the committee. If the party congress approves the idea of a referendum, the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, or parliament, will meet the next day and `` arrangements will be made to hold a national referendum in the quickest time possible,'' he said. If the people then approve a multiparty system, the Constitution will be amended, the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> will be dissolved and general elections will be held as soon as possible, he said. `` Neither I nor any personnel of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministers </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justices </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Attorneys </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> Inspectors will run in those elections,'' the president said. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> welcomes `` this movement toward democracy.'' But a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official who spoke on condition of anonymity said protesters want a clear announcement that elections will be held within a week or two, not a process that could take months. Ne Win, a former general, organized the military-dominated party in 1962. In 1964, he outlawed all other parties and began pursuing the rigid socialism and international isolation that turned one of <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>'s wealthiest nations into one of its poorest. When he resigned last month as chairman of the 1.1 million-member party, <PERSON> Ne </PERSON> <PERSON> Win </PERSON>, 77, cited his age and accepted indirect responsibility for bloody student-led riots against his government in March and June. He said then that the rioting `` showed the lack of trust and confidence in the government'' and called for a referendum on multiparty government. The rallies Wednesday, the third straight day of mass anti-government protest, attracted `` from several hundred thousand to up to 1 million'' people in the capital city of 3.5 million, a <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> diplomat said. When the radio announced martial law was lifted, `` the soldiers started to immediately pull up the barbed wire barricades, pull them away and retreat,'' <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Lubin </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> attorney traveling as a tourist, said after reaching <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>. `` The crowd immediately began to gravitate toward Sule pagoda and the town hall. People were dancing in the streets, shouting, ` We have won,''' said <PERSON> Lubin </PERSON>, 26. He said monks threw water on each other in a traditional celebration. `` A few of the soldiers were beginning to crack smiles at the people,'' he said. `` They seemed much more relaxed.'' No violence was reported. Diplomats said the demonstrators marched along main streets in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> and dispersed after five or six hours. About 5,000 people sat outside the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy listening to <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> writers, lawyers, doctors and other professionals speak over loudspeakers, a <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> diplomat said. The demonstrators sent frequent messages to the embassy asking for publicity and moral support, he said.

<HEAD>Jerome Robbins Musical to Have A $55 Broadway Ticket Price</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 `` <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON>' Broadway Dances'' will have a top ticket price of $ 55, the highest on Broadway, when it opens at the Imperial Theater next year. The $ 7 million musical will feature more than a dozen dance numbers from some of the biggest hits by the famed director and choreographer, including `` Fiddler on the Roof,'' `` West Side Story,'' `` The King and I'' and `` Peter Pan.'' The current top ticket price on Broadway is $ 50, the going rate for such musical hits as `` The Phantom of the Opera,'' `` <LOCATION> Les </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miserables </LOCATION>,'' `` Cats,'' `` Me and My Girl'' and `` Into the Woods.'' `` The Life and Adventures of <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Nickleby </PERSON>'' had a $ 100 ticket price but that was for an eight-hour extravaganza viewed in a marathon one-day performance or over two four-hour evenings. `` <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON>' Broadway Dances'' will be an expensive show to rehearse and operate, says <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Schoenfeld </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Shubert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, which is co-producing the musical. The show, which begins preview performances Jan. 16 and opens Feb. 26, has a cast of 60, <PERSON> Schoenfeld </PERSON> said, and will need to sell out every performance for more than a year to recoup its investment, even with a $ 55 top ticket price. `` We are limited to one source of income in the theater _ the box office,'' <PERSON> Schoenfeld </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` It's a question of economics.'' Adding to the cost is the musical's 22-week rehearsal period, an extraordinary amount of preparation. Most musicals have six weeks of rehearsals before opening. `` Broadway Dances'' began its rehearsals Aug. 15 at the Imperial and features a cast of relatively unknown performers. Before rehearsals began, <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON> spent months interviewing many of the original performers in his shows and, if they were available, watching videotapes of original productions, <PERSON> Schoenfeld </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON>' Broadway career began in 1944 when he did the choreography for `` On the Town,'' the <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernstein-Betty </PERSON> Comden-Adolph Green musical about three sailors on leave in wartime <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Among the other shows he was involved with were `` Gypsy,'' `` A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum,'' `` Bell Are Ringing,'' `` High Button Shoes,'' `` Miss Liberty'' and `` Look Ma, I'm <PERSON> Dancin </PERSON>'.'' <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON> left <LOCATION> Broadway </LOCATION> in 1964 after directing and choreographing `` Fiddler on the Roof.'' He concentrated on ballet, including many works for the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ballet </LOCATION>, where he is ballet master-in-chief with <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Martins </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Pinochet Government Lifts Emergency Measures For First Time In 15
Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDUARDO GALLARDO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The country's military leaders have lifted all state of emergency measures for the first time since President <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> seized power in 1973, a move the opposition greeted with cautious approval. Wednesday's decree comes just days before the four-man ruling junta is expected to nominate <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, an army general, as sole candidate in a presidential referendum slated for October. Interior Minister <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>, in a news conference, told reporters the presidential decrees lifting the emergency `` will take effect upon publication in the official bulletin,'' probably today or Friday. Opposition leaders said they hoped the move would increase the likelihood of a clean referendum. But they said it should have come sooner and that it remained to be seen if the government would actually allow citizens to fully exercise basic political freedoms. The two measures are a state of emergency and a state of disturbance to internal peace. Under the state of emergency, the government is authorized to suspend publication and broadcasts by news media and restrict public gatherings. The state of disturbance measure permits <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> to order the arrest and detention of opponents for up to 20 days; send into exile citizens deemed dangerous to internal security; order internal exile for up to three months, and restrict freedom of information and public gatherings. Lawyer <PERSON> Gustavo </PERSON> <PERSON> Villalobos </PERSON> of a Roman Catholic human rights organization told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in a telephone interview that the lifting of the states of emergency could allow most of <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s 504 political exiles to return. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, an <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> report issued today said clandestine groups linked to <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s security forces have increased their attacks on government opponents and become a major force of political repression. More than 100 people have been assaulted or kidnapped in the past 18 months, while hundreds more have received death threats, said the London-based international human rights group. Emergency measures have been in effect since Sept. 11, 1973, when <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> led a coup that toppled the government of elected President <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Allende </PERSON>, a Marxist. Such measures have been lifted before but never all at once as in Wednesday's move. <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> said the government believed it could do without the emergency powers because authorities had succeeded in establishing order within <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>. A leading pro-government politician, <PERSON> Hermann </PERSON> <PERSON> Chadwick </PERSON>, said the decision `` means that the country can rest assured that the upcoming electoral event will be held with full democratic guarantees.'' In the presidential referendum, Chileans will vote `` yes'' or `` no'' on a single candidate to be picked Tuesday by <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> as commander-in-chief of the army and by his counterparts in the navy, air force and national police. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> himself is considered virtually certain of gaining the nomination. If voters approve the candidate, he will start an eight-year term on March 11, 1989. If not, an open election will be held within a year with <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> remaining in power until then. No precise date has been announced for the vote, but <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> said it will be held in early October. The political opposition, the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> church, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and even some government supporters had asked that the restrictive measures be lifted before the referendum. `` It's better late than never,'' said <PERSON> Alejandro </PERSON> <PERSON> Hales </PERSON>, a leading opposition activists and president of the <ORGANIZATION> Chilean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lawyers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` I now hope that the government will not resort to any legal loopholes to prevent Chileans from exercising rights of which they have been deprived for 15 years,'' <PERSON> Hales </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Patricio </PERSON> <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON>, president of the moderate opposition <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` We now hope ... that all Chileans will be allowed to really and effectively exercise public liberties.'' <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Bustos </PERSON>, president of the nation's main labor federation, said the decision `` creates better conditions for a clean referendum.'' Monsignor <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bishops </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, said the government's decision `` will contribute to the peace of everyone, it gives tranquility, it gives confidence.''

<TEXT>
 As authorities tried to shut them off from the outside world, striking coal miners communicated through a clandestine network of couriers and listened in the dark to radio reports of the standoff. Provisions in stores in <LOCATION> Jastrzebie </LOCATION>, a southern mining city of 100,000, dwindled after the strikes began Aug. 16, with cheese and fresh meat virtually disappearing from the shelves. But food still reached the strikers. Farmers donated food and funds for the strikers and on Wednesday, 330 pounds of fresh pork arrived from Solidarity supporters in <LOCATION> Bialystok </LOCATION>, a city 335 miles away near the Soviet border. The police presence at the July Manifesto mine increased dramatically when more than 30 police vehicles took up positions at the main gate. A few hours later, 103 police vehicles, including an armored personnel carrier, jeeps, trucks and three water cannons, rolled through the city in the direction of another mine. The road leading to July Manifesto, where the leaders of the <LOCATION> Silesian </LOCATION> mine strikes set up headquarters, was sealed off by an army roadblock. A nightime curfew took effect Tuesday. Residents were ordered off the street from 11 p.m. to 5 a.m. to `` preserve the peace,'' according to signs posted throughout the city. The miners helped organize an effective network of couriers to relay messages among the striking mines and through a strike information center in the city's <ORGANIZATION> Blessed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virgin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. Police detained at least two couriers and accused them of speculating in bread and butter Wednesday. The two later were released and immediately resumed their rounds at the mines. Strikers resolved to continue their occupation until they won legalization of Solidarity and better wages. `` There are fewer people, but they are in an excited mood and they will stay to the end,'' said a regional Solidarity leader who visited several mines Wednesday. Not all the town's attention focused on the strike. Mothers in <LOCATION> Jastrzebie </LOCATION> were busy buying school supplies and new clothes for children who return to school Sept. 1. Those items take a big bite out of the family budget. A new school bag costs the equivalent of $ 4.50, or a miner's wages for a full day. At the church, a group of students from universities in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION> typed newsletters and communiques. They put the latest word on strikes around the country on a blackboard, and flags of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> were pinned on a map of the country to mark strike locations. In between radio news bulletins, students listen to the Doors and other old rock groups. At least two mines, July Manifesto and 30 Years of People's <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, printed daily strike newsletters on the premises On Tuesday, 125 miners at the latter mine descended 500 yards underground because they feared a police assault. On Wednesday, the miners decided to divide up shifts to have about 40 at time underground. Music soothed strained nerves, and whenever possible miners played cassettes over the loudspeakers. Still, according to the couriers inside the mines, radio news was the first priority. On the hour, strikers huddled together to listen to the latest news of the situaion of those who joined them in their struggle. They tuned by turns to Polish state radio, Radio Free <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the Polish-language service of the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>.

The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 130.24-point loser Wednesday, closed at 27,870.44, up 70.77 points, or 0.25 percent. The market recovered in the afternoon following a 31.32-point decline during the morning session. The dollar, which opened at 133.93 yen, fell to close at 133.76 yen after moving in a tight range of 133.75-134 .05 yen `` Investors are very cautious ahead of the scheduled West German -LRB- central -RRB- bank's decision on its discount rate, which has been keeping them from buying stocks,'' said an analyst at a major securities firm. `` Although the recovery on Wall Street overnight led to the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> market's rebound this morning, lack of direction in the market reversed the trend,'' he said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Foreign exchange dealers said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency fell partly because dollar-selling intervention by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and European central banks to support the West German mark finally has become effective. But the dollar's sluggishness will continue until investors determine whether the German central bank will raise its key lending rate to support its currency, they said.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Muhammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> is receiving blood-cleansing treatments by a doctor who blames the former boxing champion's weakened condition on household pesticide poisoning and not blows to the head. The 46-year-old former heavyweight champion walked into a hospital waiting room throwing jabs in the air minutes after undergoing an eight-hour blood treatment to relieve the slurred speech and tremors that have plagued him in recent years. `` I feel like I can fight -LRB- heavyweight champ <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> said in a hoarse voice slightly above a whisper at <ORGANIZATION> Hilton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Head </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> referred questions to his physician, Dr. <PERSON> Rajko </PERSON> <PERSON> Medenica </PERSON>, an immunologist who specializes in cancer and blood disorders. <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Hilton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Head </LOCATION> on Tuesday night to undergo plasmapheresis, during which his plasma was removed and replaced with an artificial product prepared by <PERSON> Medenica </PERSON>. Plasma is the yellowish fluid in which other components of the blood circulate in the body. Although <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> has been diagnosed as having parkinsonian syndrome, possibly brought on by blows to the head during his boxing career, <PERSON> Medenica </PERSON> disagrees. Calling it `` The Muhammad Ali Syndrome,'' he blamed household pesticide poisoning, which probably affected him so severely because of his rapid metabolism when he was in peak physical condition. <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> likely will return to Hilton Head for the treatments every three months or so, <PERSON> Medenica </PERSON> said. `` My goal is to remove the circulating toxins. By the end of the year, he should be much better,'' he said. Although <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> had trouble speaking, he moved with ease and appeared to be in good spirits. Moments after a brief question-and-answer session, he playfully pulled a small red handkerchief from his pocket and made it appear and disappear several times. `` I like to show people how easily they can be deceived,'' he said. <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> then performed other tricks, signed autographs and posed for photographs with delighted hospital workers. His wife, <PERSON> Lonnie </PERSON>, said that other than the slurred speech, <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> is doing better than many people realize. `` He feels no pain. He's never sick There is no hard part living with <PERSON> Muhammad </PERSON>. There is nothing special I have to do for him, except make sure he takes his medication.'' <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> called <PERSON> Medenica </PERSON> the greatest doctor in the world. `` He's got methods I've never seen before,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 Despite a bounty of good will and aid found here, drought-afflicted <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> farmers are worried that the <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> hay they are cutting for hungry livestock back home wo n't be enough to make it through winter. `` A lot of us guys are just plain out of hay,'' said <LOCATION> Albia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, dairyman <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Tibbals </PERSON>, one of the farmers who were to begin cutting today. `` But when things are as bad as they are back home, every little bit helps.'' The 64 men, women and teen-agers who arrived late Tuesday after a 40-hour, 1,600-mile bus trip scouted fields Wednesday where they would begin harvesting hay near <LOCATION> Deary </LOCATION>, about 30 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The farmers, from south and central <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, came to the <LOCATION> Palouse </LOCATION> region of northern <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> to cut hay on lands set aside for a government erosion-control program. Conservation Reserve Program land is normally not farmed, but the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> has released it for harvest by drought-afflicted farmers, said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Idaho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>, which is coordinating the hay project with the <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>. At a dinner Wednesday night, the Iowans were assigned to fields and machinery. Plans were to work from field to field _ like an assembly line _ until hay is harvested from the 4,500 acres available. The harvest could take 10 days, but cutting and bailing must be finished by Aug. 31, a deadline set by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Depending on field conditions, the program was expected to produce 1,500 tons to 5,000 tons of hay, which will be shipped without charge to <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> by the <ORGANIZATION> Burlington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION>. Sipping coffee Wednesday morning while waiting for a bus to take them to the fields, the Iowans fretted over their ability to feed and water their livestock through the winter. The Iowans said that where usually there are three to four cuttings of hay a season, this year there was one poor harvest. `` A lot of farmers are feeding their winter hay now,'' said <PERSON> Junior </PERSON> <PERSON> McCall </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Clarinda </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. `` We usually do n't have to start -LRB- feeding -RRB- hay until December,'' added <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Keller </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nunia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. In addition to donations of transportation, equipment, food and lodging, the <ORGANIZATION> Idaho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> received countless offers to assist in the harvest, <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON> said. Offers of money to help the project poured in from around the country, he said.

<HEAD>Inmates Escape In Second Break From Same Prison in Six Weeks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DONCASTER, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Eleven convicts escaped from a low-security prison by cutting a hole in a fence while other inmates rioted, police said today. It was the second such escape from the prison in six weeks. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yorkshire </LOCATION> police said 10 convicts remained at large following the break late Wednesday from Lindholme Prison in northern <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. One was captured on a farm near the prison, they said. A police statement said the escapees were not considered dangerous and were serving time for such crimes as robbery and theft. Police were called to the prison after a small number of the 753 inmates started smashing windows. The violence spread, and some inmates broke into the prison kitchen and hospital, causing minor damage, police said. Meanwhile, the 11 cut a hole in a wire mesh fence surrounding the compound and fled. Prison guards managed to restore order after about two hours while 100 policemen, aided by dogs, ringed the prison to prevent further escapes while the fence was repaired. Officers set up roadblocks and began searching the surrounding countryside for the escapees. No injuries were reported in the disturbance. On July 16, six inmates escaped from the prison by cutting a hole in the fence while other prisoners went on a four-hour rampage, smashing buildings and setting them on fire. Four of those escapees were captured. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s overcrowded and often antiquated prison system has been plagued in recent years by riots and demonstrations. Prisoners have complained about overcrowding, poor living conditions, brutality by guards and petty restrictions. Authorities admit living conditions are bad in some prisons and say the government is trying to solve the problem by building new prisons.

 Stock prices plunged today and businessmen expressed fears for government stability after <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> requested permission for the first time to return home and confront an accuser. The 70-year-old ex-president, living in exile in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, filed a petition Wednesday with the anti-corruption court demanding the right to defend himself when a former <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> minister testifies agaist him in November. Last week, the court ruled that <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> had the right to cross-examine former Public Works Minister <PERSON> Baltazar </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> when he gives evidence in a deposition hearing Nov. 7. It was the first time <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> formally sought permission from any <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> institution to return to the land he fled after the February 1986 uprising that toppled his administration and propelled <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> to the presidency. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said today that she would stand by a commitment to abide by whatever decision the court renders in the case. `` At the same time, I'm also committed to work for the national interest,'' she said without elaboration in a statement read by spokesman <PERSON> Teodoro </PERSON> <PERSON> Benigno </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> had previously refused to allow <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to return. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> asked the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> to issue him a passport within three days and to request the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government to lift restrictions that bar him from leaving <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have said they will not allow <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to leave without Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s consent. In the petition, <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> said the court had no choice but to grant his request or order the Philippine government to halt a preliminary investigation that authorities say will lead to the filing of formal criminal charges against <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. Solicitor-General <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> said <PERSON> Baltazar </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> _ who is not related to the president _ will testify about alleged bribes paid by Japanese firms during the <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> administration. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> said that as a lawyer, he demanded the right to represent himself. `` The only possible way of lawfully preventing the undersigned from personally appearing and defending himself in all such cases is for the ... incumbent government to dismiss -LRB- any charges -RRB- with prejudice,'' <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> said, meaning no charges would ever be filed. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> told reporters Wednesday that the military was drawing up security plans in the event <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> comes home. Today, share prices on the <ORGANIZATION> Manila </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> fell 20 points, and brokers said the drop reflected concern over a possible <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> return. Stock prices began falling Monday as rumors spread the former president would come back soon, and one dealer predicted a 30 percent decline unless Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> takes an unequivocal stand against <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> returning. <PERSON> Luisabel </PERSON> <PERSON> Cortez </PERSON>, clerk of the anti-corruption court, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> the three justices were studying the <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> petition but had not decided whether to call a hearing. The Aquino government has been under pressure from <LOCATION> Swiss </LOCATION> authorities to file formal charges against <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> before they will provide information about secret bank accounts <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> allegedly maintains in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. Government officials claim <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> embezzled up to $ 10 billion during his administration and stashed millions in Swiss bank accounts. Philippine law bans trials in absentia, and officials have delayed filing criminal charges for fear <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> would insist on returning. Last Saturday, military Chief of Staff Gen. <PERSON> Renato </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Villa </PERSON> said the armed forces command would not try to block <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' return but noted that the former president's presence would cause `` security risks.'' <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> still enjoys support among conservatives in both the general population and the ranks of the armed forces. His supporters have been agitating for Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> to let <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> come home for the funeral of his mother, <PERSON> Josefa </PERSON> <PERSON> Edralin-Marcos </PERSON>, who died May 4. Family members and <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> supporters say no date for the burial will be set until the ousted president is allowed to come home.

<HEAD>Study: No Increased Death Rate Among Grieving Parents</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A study published today casts doubt on the widely held belief that the grief of losing a loved one can shorten the lives of surviving relatives. The research, conducted in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, found that parents who lose a son to war or accidential death go on to lead full lifespans despite their grief. `` These findings raise questions about the effect of grief as a death-provoking factor,'' wrote Dr. <PERSON> Itzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Levav </PERSON> and colleagues from <ORGANIZATION> Hadassah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Hebrew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. An editorial published with the study in the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> concluded that the stress of grief is unlikely to cause illness in most people. `` The physician owes it to the patient to point out the strengths of the human response rather than the susceptibilities that are often belabored in the media,'' wrote Drs. <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> and <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Reich </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Brigham </LOCATION> and Women's Hospital in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. `` Rather than emphasize the disruptive power of stress,'' they concluded, `` the physician may do better to emphasize human resilience and the power of life.'' Some studies have found that when a spouse dies, the surviving husband or wife is also at risk of an untimely death. However, this could result from a lifetime of sharing the same hazards, such as smoking or poor diet, rather than grief. In the latest study, the researchers reviewed the lifespans of two groups of bereaved Israeli parents: those of all 2,518 soldiers killed during the Yom Kippur War in 1973 and those of 1,128 young men who died in accidents between 1971 and 1975. Overall, mortality among these parents was the same as for the general population of Jewish Israelis. However, there was one exception. They found that the death rate was significantly elevated among widowed mothers who lost a son.

<HEAD>Study Confirms Hazard of Low Lead Exposure to Children</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Exposure to low levels of lead early in life is linked with subtle impairment of mental development in 4-year-old children, according to a study published today. The study increases the growing body of research suggesting that small amounts of lead can hinder the growth of babies' brains. Last year, a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> study found slow mental growth among 2-year-olds who had been exposed to low levels of lead before birth, although these children were not considered retarded. The latest research, conducted in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, provides similar findings for older children. The researchers wrote that their findings suggest `` that any adverse effect of lead is cumulative and may result in long-term impairment in development rather than a delay in development.'' The study, published in the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>, was conducted by Dr. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> McMichael </PERSON> and colleagues at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Adelaide </ORGANIZATION>. The doctors studied 537 children who lived in <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pirie </LOCATION>, a town in south <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> near a large lead smelting plant. At age 2, their average blood level of lead was 21 micrograms for each deciliter of blood. A microgram is one-millionth of a gram; a deciliter is a tenth of a liter, which equals 2.1 pints. Large amounts of lead have clearly been linked with brain damage and death. But the potential ill effects of low levels is still controversial. No one knows precisely how much, if any, lead in the blood can be considered safe. Until recently, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> scientists considered levels above 25 micrograms unacceptable. But the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> study, conducted at <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, found that development is slowed if fetuses are exposed to levels above 10 micrograms before birth. The Australian researchers determined the youngsters' average blood lead concentrations during their first four years of life and gave them tests to assess their mental development. They found that those with lead levels of 32 micrograms of lead scored 7 percent lower than those with levels of 11 micrograms. However, those with higher lead exposure were not retarded. Even though they did worse than those with low lead exposure, their scores were slightly above average. The findings could not be explained by other possible influences upon mental development, such as the mothers' intelligence or their home environment. The researchers said that their work, along with the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> study, `` indicate that there may be no clear threshold below which an adverse effect on mental development does not occur.'' In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the level of lead in the air has fallen substantially in recent years because most cars now use unleaded gasoline. However, flaking layers of old lead paint may still be a hazard, as well as water tainted by lead pipes.

 <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> today said evidence indicates <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s security forces are linked to clandestine groups that have carried out more than 100 assaults or kidnappings in the past 18 months. Hundreds of government opponents have received death threats as the clandestine groups have become a major force of political repression, the London-based international human rights group. <PERSON> Amnesty </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s military government blames the attacks and threats on ordinary criminals or independent extremist groups. But it said there is `` convincing evidence'' they are in fact carried out by groups linked to the security forces. `` Evidence which has emerged through the courts, the groups' methods of operation, the impunity with which they operate and the vast resources available to them all clearly point to an association with the security forces and official condonement,'' said the report In addition, it said, in rare instances, members of units have been photographed or otherwise identified as belonging to the military or police. `` Anyone perceived as critical of government practices risks harassment and thousands live with the uncertainty of possible abuse,'' the report said. `` Intimidation by clandestine groups is now one of the most common methods of political persecution in <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>.'' The report said intimidation by such groups began to spread in 1983 following an increase in opposition demands for a return to democracy. The attacks have increased in the buildup to an October presidential referendum, it said. The military junta will choose a single candidate for president, and voters will approve or reject that choice. Victims of harassment or abuse have included political and trade union officials, human rights workers, community leaders in poor neighborhoods, bishops, lawyers, court officials, journalists and political activists, <PERSON> Amnesty </PERSON> said. The report cites 128 cases of intimidation, including that of <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Eloy </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON>, regional president of the <ORGANIZATION> Chilean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in the northern town of <LOCATION> Arica </LOCATION> and leader of a local campaign for a no vote in the referendum In April, he was forced into a vehicle by unidentified men who later fired shots at his feet, kicked and beat him and told him he would get more of the same if he continued his activities. Other victims have been given electric shocks, burned with hot metal or acid, or had marks cut into their flesh, <PERSON> Amnesty </PERSON> said. As well, hundreds of death threats have been sent, some with drawings of coffins and skulls or accompanied by dead animals, it said. <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Solar </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Quilpue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Humans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, said he found a dead cat outside his home, its throat slit. `` It was terrible,'' he was quoted as saying. `` All I could think of was to hide it so that my family would n't suffer.'' The report said that secret groups reportedly were behind the 1987 disappearance of five political activists, the 1986 murder of four opposition politicians and three other deaths in 1985. Amnesty said that although the government has said these incidents will be investigated, `` not one of the hundreds of cases brought to the attention of the courts resulted in any of the perpetrators being brought to justice.'' President <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> has ruled <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> since Sept. 11, 1973, when he led a military coup that toppled the government of elected President <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Allende </PERSON>, a Marxist.

 A crude bomb was placed in the luggage of a Soviet woman flying from the Ukrainian capital <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Volga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Kuybyshev </LOCATION>, but it failed to explode, the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency said. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said in a dispatch Wednesday that police suspect the woman's husband, a former army colonel, of making the bomb and planting it. `` The device had a tremendous explosive potential. Experts are trying to find out why it did not work,'' the agency said. It said the woman, who was not identified, found the device in a suitcase as she unpacked her bags at the home of a relative she was visiting. She was traveling with her 15-year-old daughter. The woman called police when she found the device, which contained parts of an ordinary alarm clock, and experts were called to dismantle it, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. The bomb was set to explode 35 minutes into the 870-mile flight, it said. `` Police who conducted an investigation in <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION> found in the house and garage belonging to the woman passenger's family the things similar to those of which the explosive device was made,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. `` It was found out as well that her husband disappeared after learning about the safe landing of the plane in <LOCATION> Kuybyshev </LOCATION>,'' the article said.

 The police chief in charge of hundreds of officers at a demonstration that turned into a riot resigned as the police commissioner released a scathing report blaming the violence on poor supervision. The report on Aug. 6's confrontation at <LOCATION> Tompkins </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> criticized Deputy Chief <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Darcy </PERSON>, 56, for a series of mistakes, beginning with his leaving the scene for about 90 minutes at a crucial time to use the bathroom. `` It was clear from the review that some police officers engaged in the excessive use of force against private citizens by striking demonstrators with nightsticks and kicking other apparently defenseless people,'' said Commissioner <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>. <PERSON> Darcy </PERSON>, a 31-year veteran who was the designated commander of the hundreds of officers deployed at the <LOCATION> Lower </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION> <LOCATION> park </LOCATION>, offered his resignation shortly before <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> released the report Wednesday. The two other supervisory officers at the confrontation, Deputy Inspector <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Wodarski </PERSON> and Capt. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON>, also were disciplined. Departmental charges also were brought against two other officers, and more were expected, <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said. The demonstration against enforcement of a 1 a.m. curfew that has since been suspended ended with injuries to more than 50 people, including passers-by. More than 100 charges of police brutality were filed. A police review board, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> and District Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgenthau </PERSON> are conducting separate investigations into the complaints. `` The control of the situation was lost during the first confrontation between police and demonstrators and never sufficiently regained,'' wrote Chief of Department <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> in the report. A key mistake, according to <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, was <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON>'s decision at the beginning of the demonstration to transmit an emergency signal that mobilized 300 officers from all over the city without making any provisions for adequate supervision. Other major errors included use of a low-flying helicopter with a search light, whose hovering presence acted as a magnet and drew people to the confrontation, and the premature decision to send police on horses into the crowd. <PERSON> Wodarski </PERSON> was reassigned from his prestigious post as commanding officer of the Midtown South Precinct to a command in <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION>, but he did not lose his rank. <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON> will be temporarily removed from his job commanding the a precinct for six to seven months of retraining. <PERSON> Darcy </PERSON> will receive a $ 55,000 annual pension. The police review board has identified several officers involved in the melee, relying in part on videotapes taken by neighborhood residents, and recommended charges against two. The commissioner noted that 17,000 of the department's 26,000 officers had been hired since 1980, and they, as well as their superiors, had no experience with riots. However, he said, `` The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is better than the events in <LOCATION> Tompkins </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> would have you think.'' Among the report's recommendations was a major training program in crowd control and policing of street disorders.

 <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s bankruptcy trustee says he'll shorten the time the ministry has to sell its assets when he submits a revised reorganization plan to a bankruptcy judge who rejected his first proposal In rejecting the reorganization plan Wednesday, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Rufus </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> said it failed to take into account the ministry's poor financial health. `` This plan does not work,'' <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> said. `` It does not reflect the situation.'' He gave <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> bankruptcy trustee M.C. `` Red'' <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> until Oct. 1 to prepare a new plan, and until Sept. 10 to return with information on potential buyers of the ministry's assets. <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s secured creditors rejected the plan because it allowed five years for the sale of the assets. <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s major contributors, called lifetime partners, also rejected the plan, he said. <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> could have approved the plan despite the negative votes from creditors, but decided against it. Proceeds from the sale of assets would repay <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s debts, which could top $ 130 million. <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> rejected the idea of closing down operations, saying that would kill <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s revenue sources, which include donations from viewers of the televised ministry and proceeds from the <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> retreat near <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mill </LOCATION>. The ministry, which entered bankruptcy proceedings in June 1987 after the resignation of founder <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> in a sex-and-money scandal, has been divided into the newly named <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministries </ORGANIZATION> and a corporation holding <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s assets. <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> said after the hearing that he would propose speeding up the time required for the sale of assets to six to seven months. <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> did not address the effect of the reorganization plan's rejection on potential buyers of the assets But he said setting a sale within seven months would let creditors know how much they would be receiving much quicker than the five years allowed in the original plan. <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> told the court the debtor corporation has been losing $ 400,000 a month, and needed $ 885,000 from the sale of other assets to survive 30 more days. Reynolds approved that request. <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> said he expected to have by a Sept. 1 a firm offer from <ORGANIZATION> Canadian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thomas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Samoth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to buy the <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> theme park, satellite television network and other property. The company has offered $ 113 million for the network, park and 1,700 acres of undeveloped property. He said there also may be offers from <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, businessman <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shinn </PERSON> and an <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> group he declined to identify.

<TEXT>
 Formal campaigning began today for next month's general elections, but the contest has been overshadowed by a public exchange between the only leader <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> has known and his designated successor The tension began in a three-hour speech Aug. 14, when Prime Minister <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yew </PERSON> cited the shortcomings of Deputy Prime Minister <PERSON> Goh </PERSON> <PERSON> Chok </PERSON> <PERSON> Tong </PERSON>. On Monday, he suggested <PERSON> Goh </PERSON> see a psychiatrist. <PERSON> Goh </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> really meant a psychologist, and added that he planned to nudge the prime minister out of office, probably within two years. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said Monday that his deputy could not communicate as well on television and at mass meetings as he could in small groups. `` I do n't know why. I have suggested to him perhaps a bit of psychological adjustment, maybe a psychiatrist, something holds him back.'' <PERSON> Goh </PERSON> told reporters Tuesday that <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> suggested he consult a psychologist, `` not a psychiatrist, who is for mentally distressed people. `` I do not believe that a psychologist could help me. A speech therapist and trainer will, and I have been seeing my speech trainer for over a year,'' said <PERSON> Goh </PERSON>, who sometimes appears stiff and uneasy during televised speeches. `` I am not President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. I am not good at one-liners. Neither am I Prime Minister <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>. I am not good at making three-hour speeches.'' <PERSON> Goh </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> as saying the prime minister `` is only waiting to be nudged out by a firm elbow. When the time comes, probably inside two years, I will gently nudge him out.'' <PERSON> Goh </PERSON> was picked as the next leader by <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> members in 1984, but <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> will remain in power following the Sept. 3 elections and there are no formal plans to end his rule. The dispute and the eventual shift in power has overshadowed the election in the rich island nation, a former British colony that separated from <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> in 1965. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> has been its only prime minister and the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> its only governing party. The <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said in an editorial today that `` the 1988 election is really about the handing over of the baton from <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yew </PERSON> to <PERSON> Goh </PERSON> <PERSON> Chok </PERSON> <PERSON> Tong </PERSON>, the final passing of power ...'' The governing party captured unopposed 11 of the 81 seats in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> when nominations closed Wednesday. Formal campaigning started today. The party is favored in most of the contested districts against 137 candidates from seven opposition parties and four independent candidates. Only 51 opposition candidates ran in the last election in 1984. All but three seats in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, which was dissolved last week, were held by the governing party, which needs at least 41 to form a new government and run the country for the eighth consecutive term. Opposition leaders have denounced changes in the constitution as attempts to strengthen governing party rule. One proposed constitutional amendment is to change the now ceremonial presidency into an elected office with enhanced powers. It is widely assumed that if the 46-year-old <PERSON> Goh </PERSON> takes power, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, who will be 65 on Sept. 16, will become the first elected president. In that role, he would have veto power over the nation's spending and nominations of <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judges, the attorney general and other senior posts The new president would lack full executive power, but would be able to make speeches in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and have access to all government departments.

 A mentally retarded 6-year-old girl afflicted with AIDS may stay in a home instruction program while an appeals court decides whether she must be enclosed in a glass booth if she attends school, a federal judge ruled. <PERSON> Eliana </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> earlier won the right to attend school with other retarded children when the fall term begins Monday in <LOCATION> Hillsborough </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. But she would be isolated in a special 6-by-8-foot booth until she is potty trained and stops sucking her thumb. The child's adoptive mother, <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, fought in court for two years to get her daughter in the class but balked at the glass cage required by District Judge <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Kovachevich </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>' attorney, <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanlon </PERSON>, appealed to the 11th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. He also filed a motion for a local stay, asking that <PERSON> Eliana </PERSON> be allowed to attend classes with no restrictions or be kept in the county's homebound school program until the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> court rules. Chief Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Terrell </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodges </PERSON> ruled on that motion Wednesday, allowing the girl to continue her instruction at home until the appeal is heard. <PERSON> Hanlon </PERSON> said he asked the appeals court for `` expeditious consideration'' that, if granted, could mean a ruling in late September or October. The school board Tuesday displayed the glass booth, equipped with a desk, toilet and sound system, to about 150 parents of other children who will attend the <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exceptional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> this fall. Only 11 of the school's 189 students would be in <PERSON> Eliana </PERSON>'s classroom Several parents expressed concern over having their children in school with the AIDS-afflicted girl.

 Swedish authorities kept three <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc immigrants under surveillance for several years before detaining them this week on suspicion of spying, authorities were quoted as saying today. The suspects _ a married couple and a man _ faced arraignment today on charges of illegal intelligence activity, the Aftonbladet daily said. Swedish radio, however, said the woman was released after questioning and was no longer suspected of criminal activity. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported that the three were among eight people involved in a spy ring that stole defense plans for <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and gave them to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The ring was based in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, while couriers who aided it were based in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, the Times reported. The identities of the suspects were kept secret. Under Swedish regulations, their names may not be published even after they are charged in court. <ORGANIZATION> Aftonbladet </ORGANIZATION> said all three were in their 40s and that one was a physician. They were detained Tuesday morning in the southwestern port city of <LOCATION> Goteborg </LOCATION>, it said. The couple has lived in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> at least 10 years, and the man came to <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> in 1958, the newspaper said. The Goteborgs Posten quoted <PERSON> Torsten </PERSON> <PERSON> Bjorkhede </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Goteborg </LOCATION> head of the security police, as saying the case was handled in cooperation with other intelligence agencies, which he refused to name. `` In any case, it's a question of activity which went on continuously for a long time. It is not a matter of a single incident,'' he said. The surveillance had gone on for `` years,'' he said. Authorities refused to elaborate on the affair. `` This is such a special crime that we can not say much now at the beginning of the investigation,'' Chief Prosecutor <PERSON> Sven-Olof </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakansson </PERSON> was quoted as saying in the <ORGANIZATION> Svenska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dagbladet </ORGANIZATION> newspaper. <PERSON> Hakansson </PERSON> was quoted as saying the suspects could not be arraigned on spying charges since their actions were not directed against <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>. `` Illegal intelligence activity'' is a lesser charge.

 About 30 masked men hacked to death a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> accused of collaborating with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> agents, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> residents and <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> said today. The army said he died in a clan dispute, but the village's Israeli-appointed mayor, when asked who was responsible, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>: `` The whole village. Palestinians meanwhile shuttered stores and stayed home from their jobs today in the second day of a general strike called in honor of four Arabs who have died in Israeli jails. A fifth Palestinian died Wednesday in a <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> jail, and the army said it was investigating the circumstances. It acknowledged force was used against him as he was being detained. The army imposed a curfew on <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>'s largest city, and surrounding refugee camps after 14 Palestinians were shot and wounded Wednesday in clashes with troops. Another were four were wounded Wednesday in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> refugee camp of Shati. The strike was widely observed in the occupied territories. Streets were deserted in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, and columns of black smoke from burning tires were visible. On the <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem-Bethlehem </ORGANIZATION> highway, assailants stoned several Arab cars to enforce the strike, injuring four Palestinians. They threw a firebomb at an Israeli passenger bus northeast of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, slightly injuring two Israelis, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Yatta </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>, the masked men broke into the home of <PERSON> Saadi </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazaza </PERSON> late Wednesday, dragged him outside and hacked him to death with axes, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> witnesses and <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> reported. The army said <PERSON> Hazaza </PERSON> apparently was killed in a clan dispute, but villagers said he was targeted because he collaborated with the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities. Mayor <PERSON> Ismail </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamid </PERSON> said the whole village was responsible for his death. <PERSON> Hazaza </PERSON> carried a gun, a privilege only granted to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> Arabs who cooperate with Israelis. He was stabbed in <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION> a month ago and was released from a hospital three days before his death, <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Hazaza </PERSON> was the third suspected collaborator to be killed since the Dec. 8 start of the uprising against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 21-year rule in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. His death brought the Palestinian death toll to 253. Four Israelis also have died. The army said it was investigating the death of 42-year-old <PERSON> Hani </PERSON> <PERSON> Shami </PERSON>, who died Wednesday in army custody. <PERSON> Shami </PERSON>, a resident of the Jabaliya refugee camp, was arrested Monday night when he tried to stop soldiers from detaining his son, the army said. `` Some force was used against'' <PERSON> Shami </PERSON> as he was being detained, an army spokeswoman said. She said he was examined twice by doctors while in custody and found to be in good condition. On Wednesday, he was discovered unconscious and later pronounced dead. Following <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> criticism of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s deportation of <LOCATION> Palesinians </LOCATION> suspected of subversion, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said today that authorities only deported Palestinians as a measure of last resort. `` There is no policy of deportations. There are individual decisions on deportations,'' he told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has expelled 33 Arabs since the beginning of the Palestinian uprising and has issued deportation orders against 25 more. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television reported military courts will begin hearing the appeals of the 25 next Sunday. If the judges turn them down, they may turn to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was `` shocked by ... <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s decision to expel an additional 25 Palestinians.'' In a first such warning to the Jewish state, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said relations could suffer if the deportations continued.

 A petroleum barge that sprang a leak after possibly being damaged in a storm has stopped spewing fuel, and an 18-square-mile slick wo n't do serious environmental damage to the <LOCATION> Chesapeake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> says. `` While she's been aground, she's lost effectively all of her cargo from two tanks,'' said Cmdr. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Naccara </PERSON>, executive officer of the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>'s Marine Safety office in <LOCATION> Hampton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Roads </LOCATION>. The vessel, which leaked about 4,000 barrels, or 168,000 gallons, of light fuel, remained in containment booms set up Wednesday afternoon, <PERSON> Naccara </PERSON> said late Wednesday. The 240-foot barge ran aground Wednesday morning in about 12 feet of water in Indian <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Chesapeake </LOCATION>'s western shore. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> diverted the barge into the creek in an attempt to get it to a pier where it could unload the fuel. The barge held 19,500 barrels of diesel fuel and gasoline, <PERSON> Naccara </PERSON> said. `` We had a three-mile-by-six-mile sheen,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Lt. <PERSON> Rod </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>. `` It will disperse over time.'' <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> LaCivida </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, said some of the fuel washed ashore. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said it expected minimal to moderate environmental damage. `` It's such a light oil that dissipates and evaporates rapidly,'' said <PERSON> Naccara </PERSON>, adding that no migratory birds are in the area this time of year. <PERSON> Naccara </PERSON> said the barge's owner, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carriers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Hockessin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Del. </LOCATION>, accepted responsibilty for the accident and sent a second barge to help offload the fuel from the damaged barge. The 37-year-old barge, en route from <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, was being towed by a tug when it reported a leak, <PERSON> Naccara </PERSON> said. The tug's crew said the barge might have been damaged in a storm about two hours earlier, he said. `` Winds picked up to 25 knots and the operator of the tug reported waves of about five feet,'' <PERSON> Naccara </PERSON> said.

 Anti-government demonstrators controlled this southernmost <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> town today, and student leaders claimed similar takeovers were occurring throughout the country. This correspondent, traveling by motor launch from the Thai mainland, found no Burmese immigration officials at their posts and was told all army and police units had withdrawn Wednesday to an area about one mile from this prosperous market town. The pullout, student leaders said, came after President <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> announced that the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Burma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> would next month hold an emergency congress to consider popular demands for a return to democracy. About 300 workers, merchants and students today marched through <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>, known as <LOCATION> Kawthaung </LOCATION> in Burmese, asking others to join them in further demonstrations in coming days. Two jeeps were packed with students. `` We'll continue to demonstrate.

He said a volunteer defense group was being organized among the town's 80,000 residents to help maintain law and order. Students said that they carried no weapons and there had been no bloodshed as demonstrators confronted troops in the town last week. They described some soldiers applauding as protesters gathered outside a military compound pleading with them to refrain from using force. They said about 70 soldiers from the Mergui-based 101st Division had been stationed in the town, armed with automatic weapons and U.S.-made M-79 grenade launchers. In earlier demonstrations in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> and other areas, troops opened fire on crowds of protesters and hundreds of casualties were reported. <PERSON> Nyi </PERSON> <PERSON> Htwe </PERSON> said he and about 100 other students from <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> had arrived at <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> in July to begin directing anti-government agitation. He said most of the students were former residents of the town, located on an island off the southern tip of <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>, about 490 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>. University and high school students have spearheaded the uprisings against 26 years of authoritarian rule, but <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monks, laborers, professionals and even government civil servants swelled their ranks as the protests intensified. The town appeared calm despite the ongoing demonstrations. The central market was open and passers-by looked at posters affixed to walls of low-slung houses. One poster showed ousted President <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>, widely held responsible for ordering troops to fire on protesters, with an M-16 rifle and a bandoleer stuffed with bullets slung around his neck. It read: `` <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> is Rambo.'' Another depicted <PERSON> Ne </PERSON> <PERSON> Win </PERSON>, who resigned as <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s leader last month, as a dog perched on a chair with <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> sitting under him and <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> off to one side and labeled `` running dog.'' <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>, although a civilian, has been closely associated with Ne Win and the authoritarian system for decades and is considered unacceptable by many anti-government protesters. <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> is one of the few points along the Thai-Burmese border where Thai nationals are officially allowed access. Most of the border is controlled by ethnic minority rebels fighting the <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> government. The town has prospered and its population has mushroomed because of trade with <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and two-way smuggling. As tension mounted in recent weeks, <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> authorities closed the entry point intermittently. But after a 20-minute boat ride from the <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Ranong </LOCATION> today, no officials were at dockside to inspect border passes.

<TEXT>
 The international office of the Solidarity free trade union movement today appealed for funds for strikers, their families and `` victims of repression'' in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. `` The needs are great,'' <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Milewski </PERSON>, head of the Brussels-based international office of Solidarity, said in a statement. `` If the authorities adopt the worst possible tactics, thousands of strikers are threatened with dismissal from work and extreme poverty.'' On Aug. 16, strikes began in the coal mines of southern <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. Since them more than 20 enterprises joined in, including shipyards, transport companies and steel mills. Strikers demand higher pay, better working conditions and the legalization of the Solidarity trade union movement, which was outlawed in 1982. In a separate statement, the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Confederation </ORGANIZATION> called on the 12 <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> nations to urge the Polish authorities to stop using violence to end the strikes.

<HEAD>Miners Return to Work After Strike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 More than 300 employees of a coal mine in southern <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> returned to work today after a 20-hour strike that posed the first worker challenge to the strict economic policies of premier <PERSON> Karoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>. In negotiations with senior government officials, the strikers won a promise the government would try to iron out a quirk in a new income tax law that allows workers on sick leave to earn more than those working regularly. The strikers at the <LOCATION> Komlo </LOCATION> mine 100 miles south of <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> threatened to halt work again if parliament does not remove this quirk. In addition, the government instructed companies to pay bonuses to miners who complained they had lost 30 percent to 50 percent of their bonuses under the new tax laws. The daily <ORGANIZATION> Magyar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nemzet </ORGANIZATION> published the text of a letter sent by the strikers to <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>, who in May became Communist party leader, urging him to settle `` the oft-repeated problems'' of miners at <LOCATION> Komlo </LOCATION>, 100 miles south of <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>. The letter attacked the personal income tax introduced Jan. 1 as part of <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>'s attempts to stimulate the stagnating economy. It said the tax `` does not stimulate increased production or the undertaking of extra shifts.'' `` We all realize the present position and the problems both in the national economy and in our own company, but we are faced with a situation in which our own living conditions have become worse, our real income having been reduced as a result of the inflationary impact,'' the letter added. Inflation has reached 18 percent this year. The income tax has reduced the net income of many workers by introducing taxes on bonuses and earnings from second and third jobs. <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>' government is trying to stimulate the economy to curb a foreign debt of $ 18 billion. The letter justified the strikers' demands for changes in the tax system by noting government and party leaders have said for years that `` they consider the demands of workers legitimate and will see that these are met.'' `` We miners have always honestly done our duty toward the dictates of the national economy, and feel it is the ethical duty of the government to meet our requests now,'' the letter said. Reports of strikes in communist <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> are extremely rare, and the relatively swift media coverage of the stoppage at the <PERSON> Komlo </PERSON> mine appeared to reflect the greater openness of the state-run media since <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> became party leader.

 With the symbolic passing of a small cross made of grape vines, the Rev. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> ended a three-day fast and vowed to wage a continuing boycott against <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> table grapes. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who received the cross from <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> as the president of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> ended a 36-day water-only fast, ended his fast Wednesday and passed the cross to the Rev. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, said he will fast until Saturday, when he will hand the cross to actors <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Blake </PERSON>, who will fast. `` I have fasted with <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` I have shared the pain. I want to be a better person. I want to be an even more committed person to the workers and the abandoned families who harvest the food we eat.'' Wednesday's ceremony occurred outside a <ORGANIZATION> Jewel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> food store, but <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and other demonstrators stressed they were not calling for a boycott of the supermarket chain _ only a boycott of the grapes, which the <ORGANIZATION> UFW </ORGANIZATION> maintains are treated with pesticides dangerous to farm workers. The union contends pesticides contribute to cancer, miscarriages and birth defects among those who pick grapes. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> table grape growers acknowledge that four pesticides are used, but say the same chemicals are sprayed on other vegetables and fruits and pose no health risk. A spokesman for <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> table grape growers said <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> is targeting the industry because the union does not have any contracts with growers. `` That's the bottom line,'' spokesman <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` They're accusing stores of selling poisoned grapes. That's not true. They're scare tactics.''

 A young couple who offered to sell their third child _ a 2-day-old girl _ said they did n't want to put up with another diaper change, a <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> state trooper said at their preliminary hearing. <PERSON> Gino </PERSON> <PERSON> Gargone </PERSON>, 24, and his wife, <PERSON> Doris </PERSON>, 22, were ordered Wednesday to stand trial on charges of trying to sell the infant for $ 30,000 to the trooper, who posed as a divorcee desperate for a child, a prosecutor said. Mrs. <PERSON> Gargone </PERSON> was held in lieu of $ 100,000 bail and her husband was being held on $ 500,000 bail, according to Bucks County Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reichley </PERSON>. District Justice <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Stump </PERSON> Wednesday ordered the Gargones to face formal arraignment Oct. 7 on charges of dealing in infant children and conspiracy. If convicted, they could be sentenced to 15 years in prison and fined a total of $ 50,000, according to District Attorney <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubenstein </PERSON>. A third suspect, <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON>, 40, a <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> auto body shop worker who acted as a go-between, is still at large, <PERSON> Reichley </PERSON> said. The case started when the <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> responded to an advertisement in the Jewish Times of <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> offering a child for sale; the number given was the body shop where <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON> worked.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> today accused the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration of `` criminal'' dealings with <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and demanded that the president and Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> explain why the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has `` been in bed with General <PERSON> Noreiga </PERSON>.'' The Democratic presidential nominee, in a sharply worded attack on the Reagan-Bush anti-drug effort, said the administration's indifference to the war on drugs threatened the nation's children, families, schools, streets and economy `` The most serious threat to our national security in this hemisphere is the avalanche of drugs that is pouring into this country and poisoning our kids,' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said in a speech at the <LOCATION> Cuyahoga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Courthouse </LOCATION>. `` And it is the drug traffickers and those who cover for them who are the enemies of everything we stand for in the world today.'' `` How can we ask our kids to say no to drugs here at home when we have an administration that's been in bed with General <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>?'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> asked. He chided President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for refusing to seek the help of Latin and Central American leaders to curb drug trafficking and said if elected he would use more foreign aid to assist those countries in eradicating drug crops and protecting public officials whose lives are endangered by drug cartels. `` Today, after seven years of tough talk, the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people want some answers,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. He then recited a litany of administration and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> policies he said were misguided, saying the `` Star Wars'' space defense program is an unnecessary and costly idea taking vital resources away from anti-drug efforts. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> frequently criticizes <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for dealing with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, the Panamanian strongman who is under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> indictment on drug charges. But today was the first time he called the administration's conduct criminal. `` For years, while General <PERSON> Noreiga </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> was actively involved in the drug business, we were actively in business with General <PERSON> Noreiga </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` That, my friends, is criminal.'' On Wednesday, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> questioned <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s promise to create 30 million new jobs and his credentials to manage the nation's economy. `` The next president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must be an economic leader, not a cheerleader,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said in speeches in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rapids </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION> `` He must do more than talk about jobs, he must be a president who knows how to build a strong economy and has done it,'' the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor said. `` A president who knows how to create and save jobs and has done it. A president who has the strength and the vision and the values to build a strong and vibrant future for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' The Democratic presidential nominee traveled to the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> on Wednesday after visiting the nation's capital to accept the endorsement of the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>. He attended a briefing at a high-tech center at a university in Grand Rapids in predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> west <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and then delivered essentially the same speech he gave to the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> delegates. But he did add a fresh attack on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, whose promise to create 30 million new jobs if elected president has been questioned by the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential nominee's own advisers. `` This election is n't about whether Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s own economists believe his speeches,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` It's about making every American a full shareholder in the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> dream. It's about creating jobs with a future, jobs you can count on, jobs you can raise a family on.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> conceded that more Americans are working today than at any time in history but said most people who have been forced to change jobs during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration have had to accept lower-paying jobs. He also said that in real terms, average family income has not risen in 20 years, despite a substantial increase in the number of dual-income households. `` That's the price our workers and their families are paying for voodoo economics,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` And that's why we're going to have a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> president and vice president in 1989.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told the Grand Rapids crowd that he had a `` sad announcement'' _ that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has refused to appear at a debate scheduled for Sept. 14 at the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Annapolis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has suggested the topics be foreign policy and national security. `` The vice president said he's not ready yet,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` After seven and a half years ...'' The crowd laughed and applauded as <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' voice trailed off.

 Iran-Contra defendant <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>, heckled and picketed during a fund-raising speech, called 1988 a critical election year for `` the fate of freedom,'' as a dozen demonstrators were arrested outside. Supporters paid up to $ 500 for the banquet inside the <ORGANIZATION> Waukesha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exposition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> Wednesday night, while pro- and anti-North demonstrators gathered outside. In the auditorium, <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s audience cheered security guards when two women were escorted to an exit after interrupting his speech. `` The <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans are outside protesting,'' one of the women shouted. `` That little disruption was a remarkable testament to the Constitution of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> North </PERSON> said, contrasting American freedom of speech with censorship in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Demonstrators, estimated from 125 to 200, gathered outside the hall before <PERSON> North </PERSON> arrived. Authorities said there was shoving and that some objects were thrown. Twelve were taken into custody, Deputy Sheriff <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Martorano </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Striking Municipal Workers Stage Protest March In Soweto</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SOWETO, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 About 3,000 striking municipal workers confronted security forces at City Hall today after one of the largest protest marches in a black township in recent years. Leaders of the march unsuccessfully demanded a meeting with <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>'s black mayor and white town clerk, and police ordered the strikers to disperse. The strikers then marched back to a church three miles away where the march began. Many of the strikers have been fired in the past two weeks. Trucks loaded with black soldiers followed the procession, and army riflemen were deployed atop the city council chambers. A police helicopter buzzed low over some of the workers as they began the return march, and police fired some tear gas. As they approached City Hall, marchers chanted slogans in support of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla movement and unfurled banners denouncing the local government. Protest marches are illegal in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> unless the government gives advance authorization. The strike, which has disrupted trash collection and other services in the township of 2.5 million people, began in late June when <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> officials said they could not raise pay until a widespread rent boycott ended. The strike was suspended briefly, then resumed July 19. <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, is one of dozens of black townships nationwide affected by a rent boycott that has cost local administrators more than $ 220 million in unpaid rent. The boycott started in a group of townships south of <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> in September 1985 and spread to <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> in June 1986. The boycott was launched to press a variety of political demands, including lifting the national state of emergency, withdrawing security forces from black townships and releasing political prisoners. Authorities have tried several tactics, including evictions, in an attempt to break the boycott. The latest strategy is to sell at auction the homes of boycott participants. Many blacks have low regard for their local officials, who are widely viewed in the townships as collaborating with the white-dominated central government. By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

 A new study says most homeless people are not mentally ill or alcoholic, but are simply poor and in need of help. `` For the general public, the stereotype of mental illness is there, but more and more researchers are finding that's not the situation,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Sosin </PERSON>, a professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Sosin </PERSON> and two associates conducted the two-year study, which was released Wednesday. In 1986, the researchers interviewed 535 homeless people in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s soup kitchens, shelters and other places where free meals are served. Only about 20 percent of those who were or had been homeless had spent time in a hospital for treatment of mental illness, <PERSON> Sosin </PERSON> said. Advocates for the homeless agreed with the study's findings. `` The indigent are not mentally ill or alcoholic. There are families, single women with children, abused women and runaway youth who have been threatened or abused,'' said <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Vander </PERSON> <PERSON> Kooi </PERSON>, a specialist in housing and homelessness for the <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` The only common denominator they have is being without shelter,'' he said. `` These findings mirror the new face of homelessness in every region of the country,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>, founder of the Coalition for the Homeless, an advocacy group in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. `` Homeless people are not sick _ they need help finding jobs and affordable housing.'' <PERSON> Sosin </PERSON> said stringent welfare requirements that make it difficult for the poor to receive public aid contribute to homelessness. He said that while it may appear the economy is improving, `` for the people at the bottom it is n't getting better.'' `` We were surprised that many of the homeless had at one time held working-class jobs,'' he said. `` Most.. are without shelter for the first time and have been on the streets for about six months They're not long-timers.''

 Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> met today with South African Foreign Minister <PERSON> Pik </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, and the two men said they aired their differences over apartheid without yelling at each other. `` You name the controversial agenda ... we talked about it,'' said <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, D-Ill., who favors <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic sanctions against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> `` We had a good, frank discussion.'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, who unsuccesfully campaigned for the Democratic nomination for the presidency this year, is on a five-day, fact-finding tour of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> is chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Foreign Relations Subcommittee on African Affairs and will play a major role in deliberations on pending legislation to intensify <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sanctions against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Limited sanctions have been in effect since 1986. `` We never yelled at each other,'' <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said after the meeting in a <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> suburb. `` The senator has put all the difficult questions. But he has given me the opportunity to put my side. That's all I can ask.'' <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> and other South African leaders say they are pursuing gradual race reforms at their own pace and will not be pressured by sanctions. They also say black South Africans stand to suffer the most from any economic hardships caused by sanctions or foreign disinvestment. By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> predicted Wednesday that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would intensify sanctions against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> unless the government agreed to a timetable for dismantling apartheid. `` -LRB- <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> -RRB- came here determined to find justification for sanctions,'' The Citizen, a pro-government daily, said in an editorial today. `` But then Americans do tend to have a simplistic _ should we say a <ORGANIZATION> Simple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Simon </ORGANIZATION> _ approach to other countries, and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> is probably the worst example of this American madness to recreate countries in their own image,'' the newspaper said. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> visited several black townships and met with black leaders such as Anglican Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>. The senator's request to meet with imprisoned <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> was rejected by the government. The 70-year-old <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s best known black leader, is in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Tygerberg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> being treated for tuberculosis.

 Art <PERSON> Rooney </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, who bought the <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steelers </ORGANIZATION> in 1932 for $ 2,500 in racetrack winnings and turned the team into a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Football </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> powerhouse in the 1970s, died today. He was 87. `` At 7:45 a.m. this morning the Chief ... passed away in his sleep with his family at his bedside,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Gelet </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rooney </PERSON>'s personal physician. <PERSON> Rooney </PERSON> had been in a coma since Monday. He was admitted to Mercy Hospital with a stroke Aug. 17 after becoming dizzy at the team's offices at Three Rivers Stadium <PERSON> Rooney </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Steelers </ORGANIZATION> struggled for 40 years until the 1970s, when coach <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Noll </PERSON> and quarterback <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradshaw </PERSON> led the team to dominance in the <ORGANIZATION> NFL </ORGANIZATION>, becoming the only club to win four Super Bowl games. <PERSON> Rooney </PERSON>'s reputation for honesty, sincerity and benevolence won him thousands of friends and once prompted <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, known as `` Whizzer'' during his Steeler playing days in the 1930s, to say: `` There is no man in the world I respect more than <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Rooney </PERSON>.'' Yet `` The Chief,'' as he was known, was a shrewd entrepreneur and race-track operator who earned millions before turning over his sports empire to his five sons in the late 1960s. Despite his wealth, <PERSON> Rooney </PERSON> never left the decaying neighborhood on <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION> where he grew up. His daily rituals _ Mass at a neighborhood church, five-minute walk to the stadium, cigars and chats with reporters _ rarely changed. `` I'm a <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> guy,'' <PERSON> Rooney </PERSON> would say. Born Jan. 26, 1901, in <LOCATION> Coultersville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Rooney </PERSON> was one of eight children of a saloon keeper who moved his family to <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> in 1903. As a youngster, he played where Three Rivers Stadium now stands. Though his <ORGANIZATION> Steelers </ORGANIZATION> brought him the most fame, <PERSON> Rooney </PERSON>'s first love was horse racing. His racing holdings once included <ORGANIZATION> Yonkers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Raceway </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, a dog track in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> William </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Racing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Liberty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and the Green Mountain Race Track in <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>. He even blamed his love of racing for the <ORGANIZATION> Steelers </ORGANIZATION>' early football failures: `` I did n't give it the time. I was always going to the race track.'' It was n't until after 1969, a 1-13 season, that the <ORGANIZATION> Steelers </ORGANIZATION>' luck changed. <PERSON> Rooney </PERSON>'s son <PERSON> Dan </PERSON>, the team's young president, hired away <ORGANIZATION> Baltimore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colts </ORGANIZATION>' assistant coach <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Noll </PERSON> to lead the club. Then, in the first round of the college draft, the <ORGANIZATION> Steelers </ORGANIZATION> took a promising defensive lineman named <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Greene </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Steelers </ORGANIZATION>' first-round pick in 1970 was a brash quarterback named <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradshaw </PERSON>, who threw just six touchdown passes and 24 interceptions that season. `` When I was getting a lot of heat early on, he was the one who told me, ` You're going to be great. Do n't worry about what those guys are saying,'' <PERSON> Bradshaw </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Rooney </PERSON>. `` There was no other owner like him,'' <PERSON> Bradshaw </PERSON> said. `` He was an original. He was a Northern Dancer, a <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Namath </PERSON> _ one of a kind.'' The team went on to win <LOCATION> Super </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bowls </LOCATION> in 1974, 1975, 1978 and 1979 and were hailed as `` The Team of the Decade.'' <PERSON> Rooney </PERSON>, one of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>'s finest athletes, played football against <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Thorpe </PERSON>, baseball against <ORGANIZATION> Negro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> greats <ORGANIZATION> Satchel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Page </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Josh </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> and was a superior boxer asked to represent the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the 1920 Olympics. He is survived by his sons: <PERSON> Dan </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Steelers </ORGANIZATION>' president; <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a vice president and former scouting director; and <PERSON> Pat </PERSON>, <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON>, who are involved in various family-related businesses.

<TEXT>
 Democratic presidential candidate <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> complained today about recent accusations by Republicans against him and his wife, saying the charges are becoming a distraction to the campaign. Speaking at a roundtable discussion with local reporters, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he and his wife, <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON>, are having to `` deny nonexistent facts.'' `` I think there's a pattern here,'' he said, raising his hand above his head. `` I hope to keep a high place.'' On Wednesday, the Democrat's campaign issued a statement saying that a suggestion by <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> Republican Sen. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Symms </PERSON> that Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had burned an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flag is `` totally false and beneath contempt.'' <PERSON> Symms </PERSON>' comment was the third time in a few days that prominent Republicans have aired allegations that the Democrats have rebutted swiftly. The allegations come at a time when Republicans are struggling to shift the campaign focus away from <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nominee <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and questions about his Vietnam-era service in the National Guard. In an interview Tuesday with a radio station in <LOCATION> Blackfoot </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Symms </PERSON> raised the allegation that Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> burned the flag during an anti-war demonstration in the 1960s. `` As I've been told, I have n't seen this, but I heard that there are pictures around that will surface before the elections are over of Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> burning the American flag while she was an anti-war demonstrator during the'60s,'' <PERSON> Symms </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Costello </PERSON>, an aide to Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, issued a denial Wednesday that read: `` Senator <PERSON> Symms </PERSON>' statement about Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is totally false and beneath contempt. Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> believes that the American flag is a symbol of our nation's commitment to freedom and she respects everything for which it stands.'' The suggestion that Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had burned a flag was `` absolutely false,'' Costello said, adding that while she opposed the Vietnam War, she could not recall ever participating in anti-war protests. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aides twice called back to heap abuse on <PERSON> Symms </PERSON>. `` I guess the Republicans are doing the limbo to see how low they can go,'' Costello said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Gearan </PERSON> added, `` Senator <PERSON> Symms </PERSON> should be especially careful with rumors.'' The other incidents: _ On Sunday, in an appearance on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` This Week with <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkley </PERSON>,'' <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> Gov <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> referred to a `` report I saw in the press'' that allegedly said <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> had run `` to get his son'' admitted to a special slot in a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> unit. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s son denied the allegation and said he enlisted in the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> in 1968 after personally contacting the commander of the unit he wanted to join. `` He was wrong, absolutely, categorically wrong,'' <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>'s comment. _ On Monday, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON>, the senior Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, called reporters to talk about <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' draft deferments `` I just want to point out that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> received his first of three educational deferments eight months before the Korean War ended,'' <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` My point is not to point fingers at <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, because what he did was legal. But he avoided combat by using his education deferments. There's nothing wrong with what he did because it was allowed. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> swiftly denied any suggestion that he had used college deferments to avoid combat in the Korean War, saying, `` I served my country proudly.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> attended <ORGANIZATION> Swarthmore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> from 1951-1955, requesting and receiving draft deferments in 1952, 1953 and 1954. He said he went to his draft board with several weeks of school left and asked to be drafted immediately. He spent slightly less than two years in the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, including 16 months as part of a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> contingent assigned to the demilitarized zone in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> after the fighting ended.

 A fire today destroyed much of <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION>'s historic shopping district, killed one person and injured 29 before firemen brought it under control 10 hours after it began in a 19th century department store Maj. <PERSON> Anibal </PERSON> <PERSON> Matos </PERSON> <PERSON> Silveira </PERSON>, the official coordinating more than 800 firemen at the scene, told reporters that the Chiado shopping district would `` continue to smolder'' for another day. President <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Soares </PERSON>, who toured the 10-square-block area four hours after the fire broke out in the <ORGANIZATION> Armazens </ORGANIZATION> do Grandela department store on the Rua do Carmo pedestrian mall, said one man was killed. Spokeswoman <PERSON> Ersilia </PERSON> <PERSON> Soares </PERSON> at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> said 29 people were being treated for burns and smoke inhalation, and six were in serious condition. The Portuguese news agency <ORGANIZATION> LUSA </ORGANIZATION> said the fire was <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION>'s worst disaster since a fire and earthquake destroyed much of the city in 1755. <ORGANIZATION> LUSA </ORGANIZATION> earlier quoted fire officials as saying they did n't have enough water to fight the blaze. Firemen with sooty faces complained that pressure was too low to get the water to the upper stories where the flames leapt from one building to another. <PERSON> Silveira </PERSON> said the shells of the burned-out, five - and six-story buildings on <PERSON> Rua </PERSON> do Carmo, <PERSON> Rua </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rua </PERSON> <PERSON> Nova </PERSON> do <PERSON> Almada </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Rua </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> may collapse The fire also destroyed <ORGANIZATION> Grandes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armazens </ORGANIZATION> do Chiado, <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION>'s other department store, and numerous speciality shops that had been a fixture of <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION>'s commercial life for the past 150 years The fire reportedly began around 5 a.m. Officials said they did not know what caused it, but <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION> residents were awakened by explosions of bottled gas in the stores. Officials at the scene said hundreds of people were left homeless by the fire and `` at least 2,000'' were out of jobs. No exact figures were available. The Grandela and Chiado department stores were among the oldest in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> with wooden floors and stairways and old-fashioned booths for cashiers. They had no sprinkler systems. The Chiado district is next to <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION>'s central Rossio Square 10 blocks in from the <LOCATION> Tagus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> estuary. It forms a part of the city rebuilt by the <PERSON> Marques </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Pombal </PERSON> after the 1755 disaster. <PERSON> Soares </PERSON>, viewing the flames pouring from buildings on the rua do Carmo from the platform of the 19th century <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Justa </LOCATION> elevator built by <PERSON> Gustave </PERSON> <PERSON> Eiffel </PERSON>, said the fire was a `` catastrophe.'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Anibal </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavaco </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON>, an economist, told reporters at the scene the city faced an `` enormous task of reconstruction.'' `` We are indebted to the firemen, and now we have to get down to work to rebuild this area,'' <PERSON> Cavaco </PERSON> said. Regular <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION> firemen were joined by volunteer companies from surrounding areas. Radio stations called on firemen on their annual August holidays to return immediately to <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Virgilo </PERSON> <PERSON> Madeira </PERSON>, a 67-year-old florist, looked out on <PERSON> Rua </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> as flames swept up the street toward his tiny <PERSON> Pequeno </PERSON> <PERSON> Jardim </PERSON> flower shop. `` In all the 50 years I've been here, I've never seen such a thing,'' he said. `` But I'm not leaving. I have nowhere to go.'' Police ordered residents of the area to evacuate their homes as firemen dragged orange hoses up old wooden staircases and onto the red tile roofs. Old women in black huddled in doorways holding dogs and cats in their arms, and men in suits and ties slipped down the wet, cobbled streets carrying parakeets in cages.

 Soldiers in <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION> shot to death hundreds of Hutu tribesmen and dropped firebombs on villages after Hutus burned and hacked hundreds of rival tribesmen to death, refugees say. The Hutu refugees are pouring into <LOCATION> Rwanda </LOCATION> from neighboring <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION>, where ethnic warfare with the rival <PERSON> Tutsi </PERSON> tribe has killed at least 5,000 people and sent more than 40,000 fleeing for their lives across the border. Nearly two weeks after the flare-up in a centuries-old tribal feud between the majority <PERSON> Hutu </PERSON> and dominant Tutsi, refugees from <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION> are arriving at the rate of 2,000 a day into <LOCATION> Rwanda </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s most densely populated country. `` We're trying to help them, but they are overwhelming us,'' <PERSON> Fredric </PERSON> <PERSON> Karangwa </PERSON>, governor of this province, said Wednesday. The influx of refugees, all Hutu, began Aug. 15. The refugees say that a day earlier, Hutus turned on Tutsi tribesmen in two northern communes, hacking hundreds to death with machetes and burning others in huts. None of the refugees admitted involvement in the slaughter, and it was not known what prompted the massacre. Refugees said the Tutsi-dominated army, sent north as peacemakers, turned into executioners when they arrived and found the carnage against their brethren. `` The soldiers were rounding up Hutus and shooting them,'' refugees said. `` They are collecting them into groups, taking them inside houses, closing the doors and windows and then shooting.'' The <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION> government denied the allegations and blamed the bloodshed on exiled Hutus who infiltrated the tiny central African nation. But many of the refugees in <LOCATION> Rwanda </LOCATION> have knife slashes, bullet or shrapnel wounds and burns. The refugees, most of them peasant farmers, said government helicopters dropped firebombs on fleeing villagers. The short, stocky <PERSON> Hutu </PERSON> account for 84 percent of <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION>'s 5 million people, but the tall, lanky Tutsi _ about 15 percent of the population _ control the military and the government. About 8,000 people were crammed into three camps in this section of southern <LOCATION> Rwanda </LOCATION>. Most were camped on hills overlooking a marshland and the <LOCATION> Akanyaru </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, the route to safety for fleeing Burundians. In a local clinic, a doctor and several nurses said they treated dozens of bayonet and bullet wounds. In one crowded waiting room, <PERSON> Reverin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ndururutse </PERSON>, 32, held his 5-year-old nephew, <LOCATION> Immaculata </LOCATION>. The boy's right side was peppered with shrapnel. A bandage covered a finger on his right hand, where the tip had been torn away by a bullet. <PERSON> Ndururutse </PERSON> said his nephew and his own 3-year-old son were the only survivors of a family of 15 herded into a house by soldiers who opened fire. The adults threw themselves on top of the two children, <PERSON> Ndururutse </PERSON> said. Thousands of Burundians have used dugout canoes to cross the slow-moving <LOCATION> Akanyaru </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. They hid in papyrus reeds near the river until dusk and then crossed during the night. Beyond the marshes on the <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION> side, <LOCATION> Rwandan </LOCATION> officials say, the <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION> military has closed the border and set up machine-gun posts to stop the exodus. The site of most of the killing is in <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION>'s remote north around the farming communes of <LOCATION> Ntega </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Marangara </PERSON>. The army has sealed off the areas. But the refugees keep coming and the influx has put a strain on <LOCATION> Rwanda </LOCATION>, which already is hard pressed to deal with its own population of 6.1 million. <LOCATION> Rwanda </LOCATION> has appealed for international aid. A team from the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> High Commissioner for Refugees, which said 41,000 refugees had arrived by Wednesday, is assessing the needs. <LOCATION> Rwanda </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION>, former Belgian colonies, each are about the size of <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>. The current bloodletting was the first reported ethnic violence since Maj. <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Buyoya </PERSON> seized power in <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION> in a bloodless coup Sept. 3, 1987 while former President <PERSON> Jean-Baptiste </PERSON> <PERSON> Bagaza </PERSON> was out of the country. After an abortive 1972 coup attempt by Hutus, Tutsis massacred 100,000 Hutus, including most of the tribe's intelligentsia, human rights groups said.

<TEXT>
 Republican presidential nominee <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was `` looking for a reason'' to veto a bill permitting classroom recitations of the Pledge of Allegiance. Pushing what chief of staff <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> called `` a winning issue for us,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> jumped on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on Wednesday for vetoing a 1977 <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> bill that would have required teachers to lead children in saying the pledge. `` I would have signed that bill,'' the vice president, with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on the stage, told some 3,000 Republicans packed into a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> hotel rally replete with celebrities and red, white and blue balloons. The attorney general of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> jumped to the defense of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> today, telling a television interviewer that the bill <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> vetoed would have imposed criminal penalties on teachers who declined to lead their classes in the pledge, even if they did so because of their religious convictions. Attorney General <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> supporter, also said on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America'' that in the last decade, the state's governors have obeyed all 25 advisory opinions the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has issued on pending legislation. `` He did what he should have done under our system,'' <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> said. `` We have a constitutional system and he took an oath to uphold the Constitution.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, rarely seen together, did a political tap-dance on the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> governor who is trying to recapture the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> after nearly eight years of Republican rule. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> flew to his adopted home state of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> afterward, and the vice president planned campaign appearances in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Longview </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> over the next three days. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had Republican National Convention delegates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> join him in reciting the Pledge of Allegiance as he concluded his nomination acceptance speech a week ago. Vice presidential aides at the time would not say why <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had ended his speech in this unusual fashion, although media consultant <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Ailes </PERSON> barked to a reporter, `` That's the way he lives.'' Now the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign leadership thinks it has found an issue for the vice president to seize upon. In fact, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> concluded a campaign rally Monday in <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, with the Pledge of Allegiance. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told reporters Tuesday he says the Pledge of Allegiance himself and would urge children to do so, but said the question before him was whether a governor or any other chief executive could sign into law a bill they knew to be constitutionally defective because of previous court rulings. `` If the vice president is saying he'd sign an unconstitutional bill, then in my judgment, he's not fit to hold the office,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said Tuesday. Striking back, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he would sign such a bill and let the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> wrestle with the constitutional question. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that Gov. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, R-Ill., had faced a similar piece of legislation, and had signed it `` Let's face it, my opponent was looking for a reason not to sign that bill,'' he said. `` I would have to look for a reason to sign that legislation.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said it was `` hard for me to imagine'' that the framers of the Constitution would have considered it a violation of anyone's constitutional rights to be present for a recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance `` I just do n't believe that was their concept when they wrote the Constitution for our great country,'' he said. The sponsors of the Reagan-Bush show had lined up an all-star cast of celebrities to serve as warm-ups, including comedian <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hope </PERSON>, actress <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Ladd </PERSON>, actor <PERSON> Charlton </PERSON> <PERSON> Heston </PERSON> and singers <PERSON> Tiffany </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Boone </PERSON>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> addressed directly for the first time a question that has hovered about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ever since he made his presidential ambitions known _ his reputation for having failed to make his presence known as vice president. `` I once said that he is a great vice president,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, `` but I know and I've seen that it did n't come easily.'' `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is a man of action _ a man accustomed to command,'' he said. `` The vice presidency does n't fit easily on such a man. But <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is also a patriot. And so he made it fit.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said that `` day in, day out, I have sought <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s counsel from the very first day of our administration ... No one has been closer to my side and has contributed more to our successes.''

 When <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Hume </PERSON> did n't receive his World War II medals or discharge papers by 1955, he decided it was n't `` worth all the hassle.'' But 15 days ago he got a surprise _ a package from the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> that contained his <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Asiatic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> and Victory medals he earned while in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> for five years. The package also contained an envelope with a copy of his discharge papers that were first mailed in 1956 to a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> base where <PERSON> Hume </PERSON> had been stationed in the late 1940s. `` I was shocked beyond words,'' <PERSON> Hume </PERSON> said Wednesday from his home in <LOCATION> Moores </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, about 30 miles from <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>. `` I knew in my heart I had earned them, and I guess at that time I just did n't think it was worth all the hassle,'' he said. `` I figured I'd go to a surplus store and buy them some day, but I never did.'' The package had been mailed this month from the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liaison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION>. Inside, an envelope postmarked August 1956 had been mailed from the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Personnel </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Eglin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hume </PERSON> had been stationed there while in the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> following his naval career.

 A gunman in a car opened fire on a crowd outside a pool hall, wounding eight people in a gang-related shooting, police said today. No arrests were made, and nobody could provide a description of the assailant's vehicle, police officer <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Askew </PERSON> said. The victims were standing outside a pool hall in south central <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> late Wednesday when 18 to 19 rounds, possibly from an automatic weapon such as an AK-47 assault rifle, were fired from the vehicle, <PERSON> Askew </PERSON> said. The area is popular with drug dealers, police said. Wednesday night's attack apparently was in revenge for a shooting of a rival gang member earlier this week, <PERSON> Askew </PERSON> said. He was unable to provide any details of the previous shooting. It was believed to be the worst multiple shooting since the so-called Good Friday drive-by shooting earlier this year, in which 13 people were hit, one fatally. In addition to the eight wounded, a pregnant woman was hurt during the panic, <PERSON> Askew </PERSON> said. She was taken to <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> after complaining of labor pains, but birth was not imminent and doctors were trying to stabilize her condition, said hospital administrator <PERSON> Marlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Delp </PERSON>.

 Riot police crushed strikes at three southern coal mines, miners said today. Other strikes continued along the Baltic seacoast but appeared to falter at a major steel mill, activists said. There were conflicting reports on the status of the strike at the <LOCATION> Lenin </LOCATION> shipyard in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>, where indirect talks between the government and Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> were reportedly under way. Strike spokesman <PERSON> Bogdan </PERSON> <PERSON> Olszewski </PERSON> said <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and 1,300 supporters spent Wednesday night at the strikebound shipyard. But state radio estimated only a few hundred people were on strike at the shipyard. The <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> port, the country's busiest, remained shut down, said reporters who visited it today. The government had claimed part of the port had reopened. <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>'s port director also issued an ultimatum that dockworkers would be fired unless they signed statements that they are not on strike by Thursday afternoon, state radio said. But strikers were ignoring the appeal. A prominent Roman Catholic intellectual, <PERSON> Andrzej </PERSON> <PERSON> Stelmachowski </PERSON>, met with <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> today as an intermediary to get talks started in the strikes, said <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Michnik </PERSON>, an adviser to <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>. <PERSON> Stelmachowski </PERSON> met twice with senior government officials before coming to <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> and his visit to the shipyard was approved, <PERSON> Michnik </PERSON> said. But it was unclear if he carried any message from the authorities for the strikers. The nine-day wave of strikes is the most serious to confront communist authorities since Solidarity was crushed in 1981. The strikers are demanding legalization of the independent union federation, higher wages and better working conditions. Activists said strikes continued at seven mines in the coal-rich southern region of <LOCATION> Silesia </LOCATION> and in the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Szczecin </LOCATION>. At the <ORGANIZATION> Nowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Huta </ORGANIZATION> steel mill outside <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION>, a strike continued but had weakened since Wednesday, when about 1,000 employees stopped work, said <PERSON> Maciej </PERSON> <PERSON> Mach </PERSON>, an activist at the plant. <ORGANIZATION> Nowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Huta </ORGANIZATION>, which has 30,000 employees, was the scene of a major strike in May during the last wave of labor unrest. A police raid ended the previous stoppage. Police completely cleared strikers from the <LOCATION> Borynia </LOCATION> mine in <LOCATION> Jastrzebie </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Morcinek </LOCATION> mine in nearby <LOCATION> Koszyce </LOCATION> during the night, according to workers from both mines. All strikers were evicted from the nearby <LOCATION> Moszczenica </LOCATION> mine except 40 who managed to elude police and descended into the mine shaft with bread and lanterns, witnesses said. The state-run news agency <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION>, in a brief dispatch, said miners `` left the mine'' at <LOCATION> Morcinek </LOCATION> and also reported the strike ending at <LOCATION> Borynia </LOCATION>. It did not mention the <LOCATION> Moszczenica </LOCATION> mine. `` I was convinced the police would just try to intimidate us and not rush us, but it did n't turn out that way,'' said <PERSON> Francinek </PERSON> <PERSON> Cichon </PERSON>, a member of the Morcinek strike committee. He said police detained <PERSON> Andrzej </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrzejczak </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Morcinek </ORGANIZATION> strike committee, and beat at least six men at the <LOCATION> Borynia </LOCATION> mine and an unspecified number at the <LOCATION> Morcinek </LOCATION> mine. He said none required hospitalization. The raid at the <LOCATION> Borynia </LOCATION> mine began shortly after a column of about 100 police vehicles entered <PERSON> Jastrzebie </PERSON>, <PERSON> Cichon </PERSON> said. One striker said at least 30 vehicles blocked the mine's main gate. The miners then linked arms, sat down and began to sing hymns, said the man, who refused to give his name. Riot troops ordered strikers to leave, but the miners did not budge until the troopers began to drag them out by their clothes, the miner said. Police herded men into waiting buses and drove them home, he said. Management told men to return to work Friday. Government spokesman <PERSON> Ryszard </PERSON> <PERSON> Straus </PERSON> said all but a few strikers left the <LOCATION> Moszczenica </LOCATION> mine and that the mine was working. He said about 20 strikers were still inside. No action was taken at three other mines on strike in <LOCATION> Jastrzebie </LOCATION> _ the July Manifesto, 30 Years of People's <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and the Jastrzebie Mine, activists said. Before the raids, labor leaders said the docks, shipyards and 10 coal mines were occupied by strikers. <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> said eight mines were affected. The strikes, which began with a walkout at the July Manifesto mine, have idled at least 100,000 workers at more than 20 enterprises. Strikes in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> closed the last key division of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s busiest waterfront Tons of high-grade export coal sat in rail cars at the bulk-loading terminal, idle since Monday. Riot police sealed off strikebound enterprises including the <LOCATION> Lenin </LOCATION> shipyard, where the strike began Monday.

<HEAD>Group Says School Lunches Improving But Contain Too Much Fat</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 School lunches are improving but many still contain too much fat _ at least partly because the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is ignoring its own dietary recommendations, a nutrition group said today. The school lunch program `` is run more as an agriculture support program rather than as a nutrition program,'' said <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Haas </PERSON>, executive director of <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION>. She said the department issued dietary guidelines in 1980 but has done little to see that they are followed in the $ 3.7 billion national school lunch program serving some 27 million children. Many of the foods provided to schools under the commodity purchase program compound the problem because they are high in fat, <PERSON> Haas </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> released a list of traditional menus heavy on fried food, mashed potatoes and sweet deserts and compared that to some school districts that are serving `` healthfully modified'' menus that include baked chicken breasts, raw vegetables, fresh fruit, lowfat milk and salad dressings, and homemade, whole wheat baked goods. Singled out for particular praise was the <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> school district's main course of baked potato topped with chili _ a healthful variation on the chili-topped hot dog favored by other districts. <PERSON> Haas </PERSON> said `` we just do n't buy'' the idea that kids wo n't eat healthy foods and said the trick is to teach them good eating habits when they're in the lower grades, without access to fast food at lunchtime. `` Our young children are a captive audience. We have an opportunity here,'' she said. `` We're trying to build healthy eating behavior.'' The department `` firmly supports the idea that school lunches should be consistent'' with the dietary guidelines, said <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, deputy assistant secretary for food and consumer services `` However, scientific evidence does not support setting absolute daily intake levels of sugar, fat or sodium for children,'' she said in a statement. `` Nutrition strategies warranted for the general adult population may actually be harmful to children, particularly low-income children, during periods of growth and development.'' She said `` arbitrary decisions to reduce fat may significantly reduce calorie content. Diets very low in fat must be compensated with large amounts of carbohydrate often requiring more food than a child can eat.'' Public Voice made a number of recommendations, among them: _ The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> should set specific limits on the amounts of fat, sodium and sugar permitted in school lunches The department says there is no scientific consensus on such levels for children, but <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> disagrees. _ The department should separate the lunch program from the commodity program and seek out higher-fiber food items for distribution to schools _ The department should establish a national food service management institute to train and help districts serve better quality lunches The department said it has authorized $ 50,000 to study the feasibility of setting up such a program in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>. A report to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is due this fall. _ The department should re-institute a ban on the sale of snack foods on school grounds Currently sales are banned only in cafeterias or during meal periods. The department, citing court cases, says <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would have to pass a specific law if more stringent federal controls are desired.

 The government today freed the country's most outspoken dissident, and within hours he demanded before a crowd of 200,000 people an interim government to lead <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> back to democracy State run radio said the government freed nearly 1,700 people arrested in riots during the 17-day rule of <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>, who resigned Aug. 12 as president after hundreds of thousands protested across the country. More than 400,000 people marched through the streets of the capital today demanding immediate democracy, an <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> diplomat said by telephone. Diplomats said as many as 1 million people marched in the city on Wednesday. Civilian President <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> on Wednesday lifted martial law in the capital, ended curfews and called for a referendum on multiparty democracy in this isolated <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> nation. For 26 years, <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> was under rigid one-party rule that turned it into one of the world's poorest countries. Official Radio <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> said 1,683 protesters were released from Insein Jail today. It said all others arrested nationwide since Aug. 3 in connection with the rioting would be freed except those accused of serious crimes. Martial law was imposed Aug. 3 in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>. Those freed today included 442 students, 78 government employees and 27 <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monks, the radio said. The release brought to more than 2,500 the number the government has freed. It was not known how many remain jailed. Dissident <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON> was among 10 people, including this correspondent, arrested during raids July 29 and July 30 and also freed today. The official <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> earlier said they were held for `` attacking the state.'' <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON> told the outdoor rally in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> today, `` We have complete trust in President <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> and Chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tin </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Hein </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>, in power for only a week, is the country's first civilian leader since 1962. <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Hein </PERSON> also is a civilian. But <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON> added: `` I demand <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> and Tin Aung form an interim government immediately to avoid anarchy and bloodshed in the country.'' `` We agree!'' the crowd shouted back. This correspondent, on the drive home from Insein Jail, saw people freely shouting for democracy for the first time in 26 years. People of all ages, wearing red headbands symbolizing defiance, rode in open trucks around the capital shouting, `` Give us democracy immediately!'' Banners hung across the roads said: `` We want democracy! We want a multiparty system!'' No newspapers were available because workers at all six government-approved dailies were on strike to demand democracy and press freedom. Government ministries were open, but no senior officials were at their desks and the few junior employees on hand appeared to be doing little work. Many local government offices in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> earlier were ransacked by mobs and were deserted today. After word of the releases spread, a crowd of well-wishers surrounded <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON>'s home. <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON>, a former army brigadier who sided with former leader Ne Win before they split over differences in economic policy, quickly began planning for a mass meeting at his home. The release of the 10 detainees was unconditional. <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> said Wednesday the 1,000-member congress of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Burma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> would meet in emergency session to consider popular demands for an end to authoritarian rule. State-run <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rangoon </ORGANIZATION> said the session would be Sept. 12. <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>'s government also has freed more than 700 people arrested during four days of riots that ended Aug. 12 with the toppling of <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>. At least 112 people were killed in the unrest, many of them fired upon by troops as they protested peacefully. The London-based human rights group <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> and other organizations had called for their release.

 Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> did the right thing when he vetoed a `` clearly unconstitutional'' 1977 <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> law imposing criminal penalties on teachers who failed to lead their classes in the Pledge of Allegiance, state Attorney General <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> said today. But <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Steelman </PERSON>, domestic policy director for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s Republican presidential campaign, said, `` Criminal penalties are not the issue What's at issue here was leadership.'' <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON>, a supporter of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' Democratic presidential bid, said on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America'' that the legislation required criminal penalties against teachers who refused to lead their classes in the pledge, `` even if their own religious convictions said they should n't do that.'' In vetoing the bill, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> obeyed an advisory opinion from the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> that the legislation was unconstitutional. The state's governors have been given about 25 advisory opinions by the high court on legislation in recent years, <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> said. `` Never once, with all those different governors, has any governor signed into law in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> a bill which our state's highest court said was unconstitutional,'' he said `` Since he took an oath of office to uphold the Constitution, he had an opinion from our state's highest court that that law was unconstitutional and he did the only thing that he could do under the circumstances,'' <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. On the same program, <PERSON> Steelman </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was not bound by the court's advice. `` If he wanted to test this issue all he had to do was sign the bill into law and press his case to the national <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. `` What's at issue here is leadership, whether you've got a candidate who will stand up for the majority of Americans beliefs, or whether you've got a candidate who wo n't even stand up for his own beliefs.'' The veto was overriden by the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> and the law went on the books, but it has never been enforced and its constitutionality has not been challenged. The court said the bill was unconstitutional because the state can not force citizens to take an oath that may controvert their religious beliefs.

 Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> today called `` criminal'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration dealings with <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> strongman <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> while <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> prepared for a new round of questions about his military and personal life. `` For years, while General <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> was actively involved in the drug business, we were actively in business with General <PERSON> Noreiga </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>. `` That, my friends, is criminal.'' He chided President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for refusing to seek the help of Latin and Central American leaders to curb drug trafficking and said if elected he would use more foreign aid to assist those countries in eradicating drug crops and protecting public officials whose lives are endangered by drug cartels. `` How can we ask our kids to say no to drugs here at home when we have an administration that's been in bed with General <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>?'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> asked. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> scheduled a late afternoon news conference after several days of avoiding reporters' questions about his entry into the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> during the height of the Vietnam War and his relationship with a female lobbyist. Wednesday night, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> countered questions about his military record with thrusts against <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' defense policies. He called it `` one of the worst false impressions'' that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> supported a strong defense. But Democratic running mate, <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, came to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' defense today `` The simple truth is this: Gov. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is a veteran, a patriot, and an advocate of American strength and steadiness,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said in remarks prepared for the Veterans of Foreign Wars convention in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` He can be trusted as a defender of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> security _ and as a champion of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> values.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> also bragged of his own record as a World War II bomber pilot in a contrast to his GOP rival's stint in the Guard. `` I have been there. And I yield to no person or party in my passion for freedom,'' he said. The counterchanges occurred against the backdrop of wrangling over when <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would debate, and polls showing that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s post-convention lead was narrowing. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> fared well in one of those surveys, which showed support for his selection as the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nominee and his service record during the Vietnam War. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, saying `` I can take the heat,'' told an audience of 1,000 current and former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> members in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> he was proud of his Guard service. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has been dogged since his nomination last week with allegations that he pulled strings to get into the Guard and avoid duty in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. He kept the media at bay Wednesday and did not answer questions. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, touring the industrial states of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> after picking up the endorsement of the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> leadership in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, took aim at the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's claims to seven years of growth and prosperity Conceding that more Americans are working today than at any time in history, he said average family income has remained stagnant. `` I've met too many people who have accepted jobs over the last eight years that pay a lot less than their old jobs,'' he said in <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rapids </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION> `` I've met too many couples who are working harder at two jobs just to stay in place.'' The <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> has 14 million members, and President <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> said Wednesday the endorsement should be worth a net of 2.5 million votes for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, repeatedly criticized by Republicans as being soft on defense, was assaulted on that front Wednesday by <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` One of the worst false impressions <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has put forward is the idea that he stands for a strong national defense,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told the Guard audience. `` Maybe he sincerely believes that. But he stands for the opposite, and that position has been clouded over by the distractions of the last few days.'' In <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told a rally that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, `` has more experience dealing with national security affairs than the head of the other ticket.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also praised <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as a `` man of action ... accustomed to command.'' `` The vice presidency does n't fit easily on such a man,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` But <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is also a patriot. And so he made it fit.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> jumped on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on Wednesday for vetoing a 1977 <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> bill that would have required teachers to lead children in saying the pledge. `` I would have signed that bill'' and let the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> wrestle with the constitutional question, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in a joint appearance with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. Courts have ruled such laws to be unconstitutional. `` If the vice president is saying he'd sign an unconstitutional bill, then in my judgment, he's not fit to hold the office,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said Tuesday. Two polls Wednesday indicated that the surge <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> received during last week's Republican National Convention already was dissipating. An <ORGANIZATION> NBC-Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> survey put the vice president's margin as 44-39, while a <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> survey pegged it at 49-47. Both leads were within the margin of error of three percentage points, indicating the race is a dead heat. In the <ORGANIZATION> NBC-Journal </ORGANIZATION> poll, 64 percent said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s military record should not be an issue and 27 percent said it should. Also, 42 percent of registered voters approved of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> as the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nominee, 27 percent disapproved and 30 percent were not sure. The two campaigns sparred over the timing of campaign debates for the fall, with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> saying it was `` inexcusable'' for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to decline dates of Sept. 8 and 14 established by organizations interested in staging the confrontations. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign chief <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said, `` It is unlikely that a debate can occur prior to Sept. 20.'' Aides to the two candidates are expected to open face-to-face negotiations on debates next week in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The NBC-Journal poll was conducted Saturday through Monday among 1,762 registered voters, the <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> poll Friday through Monday among 1,310 likely voters.

<HEAD>Cabinet Minister: Mandela May Be Moved From Hospital</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Jailed black leader <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> may be moved soon from the hospital where he has been treated for tuberculosis, a <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> minister indicated today. Information Minister <PERSON> Stoffel </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> der </PERSON> <PERSON> Merwe </PERSON> declined to say whether <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> would go back to <LOCATION> Pollsmoor </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prison </LOCATION>, where he has been serving a life sentence for plotting an anti-government sabotage campaign. The <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> leader, jailed since 1962, was moved from <LOCATION> Pollsmoor </LOCATION> to nearby <LOCATION> Tygerberg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> on Aug. 12. Doctors say he is expected to recover fully after a recuperation period of about five months. `` Hospitals are for people that are in need of immediate treatment,'' <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> der </PERSON> <PERSON> Merwe </PERSON> said. `` If he is not in need of immediate treatment, then it becomes logical to move him somewhere else. Whether inside <LOCATION> Pollsmoor </LOCATION> or outside <LOCATION> Pollsmoor </LOCATION> is another question.'' Asked if <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> was still in need of immediate care, <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> der </PERSON> <PERSON> Merwe </PERSON> replied: `` Not as immediate as before.'' The government has said it is seriously considering the possibility of freeing <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, whom many blacks consider their leader. Some officials have suggested that <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, after he is discharged from <LOCATION> Tygerberg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, would be moved to a private clinic and kept there under custody while the government continues to assess the consequences of his possible relesase. About 60 black women from an anti-apartheid organization came to <LOCATION> Tygerberg </LOCATION> today with flowers for <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>. They left the flowers at a reception desk, then left the hospital dancing and chanting pro-Mandela slogans. The <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is the major guerrilla group fighting the white-dominated government and its system of apartheid. By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

<HEAD>Evacuated Residents Spend Second Day Away From Homes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 About 3,000 evacuated residents spent a second day away from their homes today awaiting the results of soil and water tests to see whether a PCB fire caused long-term contamination of their community. `` We do n't know if we and our homes have been contaminated,'' said <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Charbonneau </PERSON>, one of 150 frustrated evacuees from suburban <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basile-le-Grand </LOCATION> being sheltered in a local school. `` My wife is pregnant. What tells us that her pregnancy wo n't be affected?'' The first test results were to be made public later today, but there was no guarantee the residents would be allowed back into their homes. Most were staying with friends and relatives. The fire burned overnight Tuesday at a depot storing 23,400 gallons of oil tainted with PCBs, or polychlorinated biphenyls. The flames sent a toxic black cloud over a 5.5 square mile area. No one was seriously injured but at least 50 were treated for lung and skin irritation. Quebec Agriculture Minister <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Page </PERSON> estimated that 400 cows could have been contaminated, as well as hundreds of acres of farmland. Authorities sealed off the normally tranquil suburb, 15 miles east of <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>, and told residents not to eat fruit or vegetables from their gardens, drink tap water or use backyard pools until tests were completed. PCBs are suspected of causing cancer and production of the chemical is banned. But supplies formerly used to cool hydroelectric transformers are stored at depots throughout the province, which has no facility capable of neutralizing or destroying the chemicals. Some of the 3,000 residents who were whisked from their homes hired a lawyer on Wednesday to give legal clout to their anger over the presence of potentially deadly chemicals in their neighborhood. `` Clearly, they're looking at a terribly serious type of damage from the health, economic, commercial ... points of view,'' said <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Liebman </PERSON>. Dr. <PERSON> Gaetan </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrier </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> De </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maisonneuve-Rosemont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> said exposure to PCBs could cause cancers, liver disorders, skin rashes, birth defects and spontaneous abortions. Quebec Premier <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bourassa </PERSON> and Environment Minister <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> flew to <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Basile </PERSON> on Wednesday to face hostile residents who have lobbied for years to have the <ORGANIZATION> PCB </ORGANIZATION> dump removed. <PERSON> Bourassa </PERSON> said the incident was `` serious but not dramatic,'' and promised compensation to the victims. But residents were not mollified. `` Get that damned stuff out of here,'' shouted <PERSON> Charbonneau </PERSON> to cheers and applause from the crowd. `` You have turned our town into the garbage can of the province.'' Quebec Fire Commissioner <PERSON> Cyrille </PERSON> <PERSON> Delage </PERSON>, directing an inquiry into the fire, said the warehouse's fire and burglar alarm did n't work But he said the depot's owner, <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, had conformed with safety regulations introduced by his department in 1985 for storing PCBs. Residents have charged, however, that the lack of a fence, sprinkler system and security guard made the site a time bomb. <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> said he intends `` to go after'' the company, whose major shareholder is former <ORGANIZATION> Environment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> employee <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON>. No cause of the fire has been determined but officials were considering the possibility of arson because of the manner in which the warehouse exploded and blazed. Only about 5,720 gallons of the PCB-contaminated oil burned, leaving the problem of how to dispose of the remainder, officials said.

 A musical spoof of Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> service has been banned from the radio station where it first aired, the station manager said today The parody, `` I Spent the War in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>,'' was ruled off-limits by <ORGANIZATION> WFBQ </ORGANIZATION>'s manager <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Wheat </PERSON> after a close vote by listeners on whether to continue playing the song. The spoof, co-written by station disc jockey <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Griswold </PERSON> and local song writer <PERSON> Rickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridell </PERSON>, first aired Monday. It was pulled by Wheat the next day after listener complaints. Wheat then asked listeners to vote on whether they wanted to keep hearing it. The song spoofs <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s alleged use of family influence to get into the Guard in 1969 while others were sent to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. The final tally of the 24-hour call-in vote was 5,182 votes for the station to continue playing it and 4,676 votes against playing it. Wheat said the 500-vote margin was inconclusive and he feared the station would alienate half its listeners if the song continued. `` <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has not been accused of being a draft dodger,'' Wheat said. `` There has been no proof of that. There was enough in the song that we felt it was in our best interest to discontinue it.'' Wheat said he believes <PERSON> Griswold </PERSON> and his sidekick, disc jockey <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Kevoian </PERSON>, `` understand that we wanted to protect the radio station as a whole, and that it was n't going to be a yes-no, black-or-white vote. The vote was close and it led me to believe that to continue playing it would be a detriment to the station.'' <PERSON> Griswold </PERSON> said he was considering releasing the song on an inexpensive cassette with proceeds from sales going to the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Veterans </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> organization.

 About 1,500 Taiwanese aborigines marched Thursday to demand that the government return their ancestral lands.

<TEXT>
 American swimmer <PERSON> Lynne </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> will take the plunge into <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Baikal </LOCATION> for a 9.92-mile swim Friday, two days earlier than scheduled because of forecast bad weather, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported. The official news agency said in a dispatch Thursday from the eastern Siberian city of <LOCATION> Irkutsk </LOCATION>, where Ms. <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> is training, that the weather service forecast a heavy storm for the weekend. She had planned her swim in the world's deepest lake for Sunday. `` I am now sure that I will swim well the whole 16-kilometer-long distance from the Tolsty Cap to the <LOCATION> Listvyanka </LOCATION> settlement,'' she told <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> after swimming Thursday in the <LOCATION> Angara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. The main concern will be the water temperature. <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Baikal </LOCATION>, shaped like a crescent, is rarely warmer than about 50 degrees Fahrenheit. Ms. <PERSON> Cox </PERSON>, 31, of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alamitos </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, hopes to be the first person to swim across <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Baikal </LOCATION>, which reaches a depth of 4,800 feet at some points. It is about 1,800 miles east of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and north of <LOCATION> Mongolia </LOCATION>. Soviet media have been reporting extensively on her preparations. Radio <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> and Soviet newspapers have run frequent reports. Ms. <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> has been making long-distance swims for more than a decade. She has tackled the English Channel, the <ORGANIZATION> Strait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Cook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strait </ORGANIZATION>. Last year she swam 2.7 miles across the frigid <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION>. The endurance swim in <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Baikal </LOCATION> is meant to promote U.S.-Soviet friendship, peace and sports, she said. She has been training by staying in Baikal waters for several hours a day, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said.

<HEAD>Report Says 120,000 Caiman Skins Smuggled Into Japan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Smugglers used stolen or falsified export documents to ship more than 120,000 skins of a protected species of alligator into <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in the past seven months, a wildlife protection organization said Thursday. TRAFFIC <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the wildlife trade monitoring group of the World Wide Fund for Nature, said the smugglers shipped <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> caiman skins by a complex route involving at least seven <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> countries. At least 46 tons of the skins from more than 120,000 alligators entered <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in the first seven months of this year through <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> alone, the group said. It said it believed the skins were part of a larger shipment that was loaded onto Asian-bound ships off the coast of <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> at the end of last year. The declared customs value of the skins was about $ 3.2 million, `` but retail value would be four to five times more,'' spokeswoman <PERSON> Cecila </PERSON> <PERSON> Song </PERSON> said. The skins are used in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> mainly for belts and watchbands. Permits are required for exporting South American caiman skins under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, an international treaty regulating trade in protected plants and animals, Ms. <PERSON> Song </PERSON> said. Japanese officials allowed the shipments to enter the country without proper verification of the export documents, the group said. It said an eight-month investigation revealed a serious lapse of treaty administration in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. The group said it began its investigation when Japanese customs data showed a sudden increase in imports of alligator skins from <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>. It said Thai authorities confirmed that stolen Thai documents were used for a shipment of 15,000 caiman skins to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, and that the government of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> disputed documents issued in <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> that identified <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> as the source of 35,000 more skins. An estimated 200,000 caiman skins, many poached in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, were loaded on ships off <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> in 1987. After <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> initially refused to allow their entry because of insufficient documentation, the skins were taken to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, which are not members of the convention, and to <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, the group said. But because <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> was likely to scrutinize imports of skins from those countries, they were moved to <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, which is a member of the convention, the group said. It said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> responded to evidence of illegal caiman trade by beginning a new voluntary check system on all imports of the skins. Ministry officials were not available Thursday night for comment.

Rescue workers also found the badly burned body of an employee amid the rubble of Alcoholeras del Puerto on the outskirts of this town, 60 miles south of <LOCATION> Seville </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> coast, he said. Four people, including three children, were hospitalized for burns, <PERSON> Torrez </PERSON> said. Officials have not yet determined the cause of the blaze, he said.

 Three new opinion polls have found narrow leads for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the presidential race, although voters preferred the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nominee to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s own running mate, Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s leads _ five points in one poll released Wednesday, two points in two others _ fell within their margins of sampling error. The race was 44 percent to 39 percent in an <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> poll, 49-47 in a <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> survey, 48-46 in an <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> poll. The polls showed increases in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s popularity after the Republican National Convention in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> last week. His opponent, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, had led by as many as 18 points after the Democratic convention. However, some pollsters have suggested that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s post-convention rebound was cut short by attention on questions of whether <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> used his wealthy family's influence to avoid the draft during the Vietnam War Pollster <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said he believed the issue had `` blunted and badly eroded'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s boost. But <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Alderman </PERSON>, pollster for <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, said he had not seen statistical evidence that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> had damaged <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s standing. And 64 percent in the <ORGANIZATION> NBC-Journal </ORGANIZATION> poll said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s military record should not be an issue in the campaign. In <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>' poll, Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' running mate, outpolled <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> by 57-40 when voters were asked their preference for vice president alone. Fifty-two percent rated <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s choice of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> as `` only fair'' or `` poor,'' compared with 44 percent who said `` excellent'' or `` pretty good.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> fared better in another measure, used in the NBC-Journal poll: Forty-three percent approved of him as the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nominee, while 27 percent disapproved and 30 percent said they were not sure. The NBC-Journal poll was conducted Saturday through Monday among 1,762 registered voters, the <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> poll Friday through Monday among 1,310 likely voters. Both had error margins of plus or minus three points. The ABC-Post poll was conducted Aug. 17 through Tuesday among 1,123 likely voters, with a margin of error of plus or minus four points. Earlier this week, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> led by six points in a <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> poll conducted Friday through Monday and four points in a Gallup poll done the same time; those spreads also fell within the three-point margins of sampling error. Another Gallup poll, done on the last day of the convention, Thursday, and on Friday, found <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> leading by nine points, slightly beyond the four-point error margin of that survey.

<HEAD>Judge Dismisses Contempt Motion Against Maria DeSillers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A judge today spared <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> a jail sentence for contempt of court, ruling she could not be ordered to surrender records and items bought with donations for her late son <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON>'s liver transplant. Dade Circuit Judge <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Christie </PERSON> said surrendering the items `` would tend to incriminate her'' in parallel criminal investigations. Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> only smiled slightly as the judge made the annoncement. `` I'm very happy. People have forgotten what <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> went through,'' she said outside the courtroom. <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON>, 7, died in April 1987 while awaiting a fourth transplant at Children's Hospital of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. `` I'm just gratified,'' said her attorney <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, who had repeatedly raised the issue of self-incrimination during the two-day contempt hearing. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dribin </PERSON>, the attorney for the court-appointed curator, refused to comment on the ruling. The hearing was to determine if Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> should be jailed for her failure to turn over financial records and surrender jewelry, clothes, furniture and other items she bought with some of the $ 690,000 donated for her son's unsuccessful operations. As the hearing ended, however, it was Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON>' boyfriend <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> who was taken into custody by <ORGANIZATION> Metro-Dade </ORGANIZATION> police. <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> had been sitting supportively behnd Ms. DeSillers during the proceedings. Police spokesman <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> said <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> had pawned a stolen computer at the same shop he also pawned items allegedly bought by Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> with donations. Earlier during the hearing, <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> <PERSON> Munez </PERSON> told the court she gave <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> $ 900 in cash for her personal use. `` I imagined she would have some need. I put it in purse,'' said <PERSON> Munez </PERSON>, one of six witnesses who said their contributions were for both <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> and his mother. Another witness, <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, said she gave $ 50 for <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> and gave other cash to his mother `` for whatever she needed.'' In closing arguments <PERSON> Black </PERSON> said his client, who is also under criminal investigation, has a right against self-incrimination. `` The court, I know, has the power to put her in jail, and a lot of people would applaud,'' <PERSON> Black </PERSON> said. `` I just ask the court to exercise its discretion and common sense.'' But <PERSON> Dribin </PERSON> said the matter was clear. `` What's at issue is the integrity of the legal system,'' <PERSON> Dribin </PERSON> said. `` Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> was the custodian of those funds. She has a resonsibility to account for them.'' Lawyers handling the estate of the boy `` are trying to show she's a greedy, uncaring person and that's not so,'' <PERSON> Black </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Christie </PERSON> had ruled that the thousands of donations for <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> belong in a trust to pay the boy's outstanding medical bills or to help sick, needy children. The judge had repeatedly ordered Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> to give to court-appointed estate curator <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Gievers </PERSON> the financial records and items allegedly bought with about $ 200,000 in donations. Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> this month surrendered her BMW car but nothing else, and Ms. <PERSON> Gievers </PERSON> has asked the judge to hold her in contempt. <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON>'s plight was widely publicized after more than $ 4,000 gathered for him by schoolmates was stolen from a classroom closet, and donations began pouring in from around the world. Among donations received were $ 1,000 from President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and $ 200,000 from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> industrialist <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Posner </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> gave <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> a deposit but has refused to pay the remaining $ 262,000 medical bill, claiming that her son received improper care.

<TEXT>
 Defense lawyers today asked the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> to dismiss a dereliction-of-duty charge against a lieutenant who sought a court-martial in an effort to clear his name in the training death of a rescue-school recruit. The military judge, Cmdr. <PERSON> Newell </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Krogmann </PERSON>, made no immediate decision on that request. He did, however, grant a defense motion for Vice Adm. N.R. Thunman, who convened the court-martial, to be called as a witness to answer questions about whether he might be biased against Lt. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Torchia </PERSON>, 32, of <LOCATION> Princeton </LOCATION>, Ill. The trial was then recessed while lawyers met with the judge to discuss procedural matters. In asking for the court-martial, <PERSON> Torchia </PERSON> put his <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> career on the line, since he was offered unspecified non-judicial punishment that would have been less severe than what he faces if convicted at the court-martial. Testimony at a June investigative hearing indicated Airman Recruit <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON>, 19, of <LOCATION> Appleton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, was literally scared to death when <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> rescue swimmer instructors allegedly pushed him back into a pool and held his head underwater after he had panicked and climbed out during a drill. <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> had a phobia about being pulled under water, which triggered heart failure followed by drowning at <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION>, a pathologist testified. <PERSON> Torchia </PERSON>, 32, was formerly in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Swimmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. A guilty verdict could bring him up to three months of confinement, loss of pay and a formal reprimand that could made advancement in the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> extremely difficult. But by opting for a trial he has an opportunity to exonerate himself. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> accuses <PERSON> Torchia </PERSON> of negligently failing to ensure that <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> was permitted to drop out of the voluntary course during a dangerous training exercise although he knew the recruit had tried to drop out and was afraid of the water. <PERSON> Torchia </PERSON> was in his office overlooking the pool talking on the telephone at the time of <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON>'s death, witnesses said. He is one of two <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> men facing courts-martial as a result of <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON>'s death. Scheduled for trial Monday is Petty Officer 2nd Class <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Combe </PERSON>, 26, charged with the more serious counts of involuntary manslaughter, battery and conspiracy to commit battery. <PERSON> Combe </PERSON> is accused of holding <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> underwater. If convicted, he could be dishonorably discharged and sentenced to prison for more than three years. He was denied the option of accepting less severe non-judicial punishment. Four other instructors, all petty officers, accepted non-judicial punishment that included reductions in rank for two of them and fines. <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> died during a drill known as `` sharks and daisies,'' in which instructors, playing the role of panicked air-crash survivors, would randomly grab trainees in head holds. Students were supposed to pull the instructors under to break their grip, then put them in rescue holds and tow them to the side of the pool. After <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> was forced back into the pool, <PERSON> Combe </PERSON> put a head hold on him, according to investigative testimony. Witnesses differed on whether <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> collapsed while in the instructor's grasp or extricated himself and collapsed while towing <PERSON> Combe </PERSON>

Police found the animals nearby. One of the officers armed with the darts fired on the animals. `` Unfortunately the dose used to put the two lions and the tiger to sleep was excessive, and two of the animals died from a heart attack,'' <PERSON> Cristo </PERSON> said. The other lion was returned to the circus. No one was injured, <PERSON> Cristo </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>More Flooding Expected From Tropical Depression That Killed Three</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A tropical depression blamed for three deaths in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> began moving over the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> today with more flooding expected, forecasters said. The depression was centered about 35 miles west-southwest of <LOCATION> Santo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Domingo </LOCATION> and was packing winds of 35 mph with storm-force gusts, according to a 6 a.m. EDT advisory by the National Hurricane Center in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. `` The movement over land is the only thing that's keeping this from strengthening into a tropical storm,'' said forecaster <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Case </PERSON>. The depression, moving toward the west-northwest at 15 mph, was expected to trigger rainfall totals of 5 to 10 inches in the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, where flash-flood warnings were in effect. Flash-flood warnings remained in effect for <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, where 6.6 inches of rain were reported over the past 24 hours. Two men and a 12-year-old boy were killed in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> in two separate incidents Wednesday night when trees crushed their cars as they were driving along rural roads, police said. State Secretary <PERSON> Sila </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> declared a state of emergency and <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> units were mobilized to rescue families trapped by swollen rivers. In <LOCATION> Mayaguez </LOCATION> on the western side of the island, the <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> ordered hundreds of residents in low-lying areas to abandon their homes. More than 100 homes in different parts of the island were destroyed or seriously damaged by flooding, according to the Civil Defense. Education Department Secretary <PERSON> Awilda </PERSON> <PERSON> Aponte </PERSON> <PERSON> Roque </PERSON> closed public schools throughout <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> because of flooding danger. A second depression remained far off in the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>, about 1,000 miles west-northwest of the <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Verde </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> off west <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. It was moving west at about 17 mph and had sustained winds of 35 mph. `` As far north as it is now, the chances of it getting here are pretty slim,'' Case said. Depressions are upgraded to tropical storms when their sustained winds reach 39 mph and to hurricanes when winds hit 74 mph. There have been two tropical storms so far in the 1988 <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> hurricane season, but neither reached hurricane strength. The season runs from June 1 to Nov. 30.

 Here are excerpts from the speech delivered by <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> on Aug. 28, 1963, in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>: I say to you today, my friends, so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> dream. I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: `` We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal.'' I have a dream that one day on the red hills of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood. I have a dream that one day even the state of <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice. I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character. I have a dream today! I have a dream that one day, down in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of interposition and nullification, one day right there in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, little black boys and little black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and little white girls as sisters and brothers. ... So let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>; let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>; let freedom ring from the heights of the Alleghenies of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>; let freedom ring from the snow-capped <ORGANIZATION> Rockies </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>; let freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. But not only that, let freedom ring from <LOCATION> Lookout </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>; let freedom ring from every hill and molehill in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> _ from every mountainside, let freedom ring. And when this happens, when we allow freedom to ring, when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God's children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old <ORGANIZATION> Negro </ORGANIZATION> spiritual: `` Free at last. Free at last. Thank God Almighty, we are free at last.''

<HEAD>Soviets Take First Step Toward Foster Care Program</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KAREN GILMOUR</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has taken the first step toward a paid foster care program, changing a system that for years has relied on orphanages as the only official means of supporting children without parents. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper Pravda reported Thursday on a decree from the Council of Ministers tht laid the groundwork for a foster program, but was vague on its details. Pravda said that under the program, foster parents would be recruited to move into newly constructed `` children's towns,'' where they would be responsible for the rearing of up to 10 children. `` In such children's settlements, apartment houses, a school, a sports center and gardens should be included. Such settlements will be built with local climatic and social conditions taken into consideration,'' Pravda said. But the article did not say how much foster parents would be compensated, give guidelines on who would be considered a foster parent or under what circumstances the person would qualify for financial support. Over the years, some Soviets voluntarily have taken parentless children into their homes, but have received no compensation from the state. If support was forthcoming, it usually was in the form of an offer of food rationing coupons from the Soviet Children's Fund, a charitable organization that was formed only recently. The decree said foster parents should be given priority consideration in booking state-provided vacation lodging and will remain at full pension, if they are elderly or retired. `` Foster parents have to be supported by their respective offices and organizations, they have to be given places at rest houses and santoriums,'' the article said. For years, public discussions on parentless children centered on those who were orphaned. But lately the official media has acknowledged that some children are homeless because of abusive or alcoholic parents, or an unwed mother unwilling to bear the stigma or responsiblity of single parenthood. Officials said three years ago that 300,000 children were being reared in state orphanages and most were placed there by single mothers. In recent years, the media has published reports detailing corruption in some orphanages, where children's food is sold on the black market and they are improperly clothed and housed. The Council of Ministers said authorities will build 30 children's towns, which appear similar in concept to cluster homes in the West, and 150 to 200 children will be housed there.

 Israeli helicopter gunships today rocketed densely populated districts and <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> bases inside a refugee camp. Police said 10 people, including one guerrilla, were wounded in the six-minute attack south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Ein </PERSON> el-Hilweh refugee camp that began at 5:45 p.m. Police said three Israeli helicopter gunships flew in from the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> to blast their targets. The camp is on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>, 25 miles south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The helicopters fired at least 10 rockets at civilian neighborhoods and <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> bases on the main <PERSON> Ein </PERSON> el-Hilweh road, usually crowded at that time of day. Police said three rockets crashed on the main road, wounding nine civilians and damaging a car. Sidon-based reporters said black smoke billowed from the stricken targets in <LOCATION> Ein </LOCATION> <LOCATION> el-Hilweh </LOCATION>, the largest refugee camp in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> with 60,000 people. Police said four rockets hit an empty two-story base used by the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Struggle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, the fourth time in one year the center has been raided by the Israelis. Three other rockets slammed into the one-story office of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Habash </PERSON>'s Marxist group, the <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> for the Liberation of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>. Those rockets wounded a guerrilla from the front and blasted gaping holes in the building. A spokesman for the Israeli army command in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> confirmed the raid and said its aircraft had returned home safely. He provided no other details, but <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> military sources confirmed that helicopter gunships were used. Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity. The raid was <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 13th into <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> this year. By police count, 65 people have been killed and 93 wounded in the 12 previous air raids. The last attack was on Aug. 9, when <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> warplanes bombed a guerrilla-run radio station in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.

 Republican vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said today he was tired of talking about the controversy surrounding his military record, saying `` I've answered questions for seven days now.'' The <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator said he thought the public also had heard enough on the issue. `` The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people want to talk about the future. I believe that they're getting a little sick and tired of going back twenty years,'' he told reporters en route to the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fair </LOCATION>. After avoiding reporters for days, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> made himself available several times today and scheduled a late afternoon news conference. On Wednesday, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> depicted himself as an expert on defense matters during a speech before a supportive <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> group, and said he wo n't `` run away'' from the dispute over his own military record. Speaking to a uniformed crowd of 1,000 current and former Guard members, the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nominee sought to answer allegations that he pulled strings to get into the Guard and avoid duty in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. `` I was not seeking special treatment. I was n't looking for favors,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. He said when he joined the Guard in 1969, `` I had no reason to be ashamed of my service.'' `` And you know what, I'm sure as hell not ashamed of it now!'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said as his audience cheered. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s speech came after a day in which he was carefully shielded from reporters. Aides acknowledged that they were trying to shift the focus away from questions about <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s own military record and personal life as he opened his first solo campaign trip. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Prosperi </PERSON>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s press secretary, said the speech was intended to deal with the Guard question and then `` go beyond to talk about defense'' and other issues the campaign wanted to stress. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> sprinkled his speech with sarcastic remarks about `` my newfound friends in the news media.'' `` I did in fact eat graham crackers'' as a youngster, `` was very partial to <PERSON> Superman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> the Menace comic books'' and `` traded Valentine cards with a beautiful second-grader named <PERSON> Penny </PERSON> who lived across the street,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said in a mock `` tell-all'' moment with the audience. He said, however, that the scrutiny is a consequence of his vice presidential candidacy and he is prepared to confront that. `` It's not fun, but I knew what I was getting into and I can tell you, I can take the heat,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. In his speech, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said he believed Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` is enjoying this firestorm because it's helped distract people from the issues of this campaign. He attacked <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for an `` anti-defense attitude'' for opposing such weapons systems as the Strategic Defense Initiative and the MX missile. `` One of the worst false impressions <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has put forward is the idea that he stands for a strong national defense,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. `` Maybe he sincerely believes that. But he stands for the opposite, and that position has been clouded over by the distractions of the last few days.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> had a good-natured encounter at the <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, airport with his <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> counterpart, Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, who had just warned Southern state legislators not to `` risk youthful indiscretion'' in someone like <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> who might someday ascend to the presidency. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> ignored reporters' questions seeking a response to <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s remarks. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> had noted <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s abrupt about-face earlier this week in which he told a Veterans of Foreign Wars convention that `` youthful indiscretion'' was to blame for his vote last month against elevating the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> to a Cabinet-level department.

 Severe overcrowding at two <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> psychiatric centers led the state commissioner of <ORGANIZATION> Mental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> to declare a state of emergency today, a spokesman for the agency said. The declaration will allow the state to immediately transfer 190 patients from the state-run <ORGANIZATION> Kingsboro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> and 50 from the <ORGANIZATION> Kings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychiatric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, a city-run facility, said spokesman <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Osborn </PERSON>. `` We're declaring a state of emergency because the extreme overcrowding is affecting the life and safety of patients at both hospitals,'' said <PERSON> Osborn </PERSON>, a spokesman for Mental Health Commissioner <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Surles </PERSON>. Most of the patients will be transferred to state facilities on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Rockland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Dutchess </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> counties, he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Kings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychiatric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> has 160 beds for mental health patients and a current population of 195, <PERSON> Osborn </PERSON> said. Matters are worse at the neighboring <ORGANIZATION> Kingsboro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychiatric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, where there are 566 beds and 736 patients, he said. The result is that psychiatric patients have been sandwiched six in a room instead of four, and have been left in beds in hallways and day rooms, <PERSON> Osborn </PERSON> said. At <LOCATION> Kings </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, patients have been left in the emergency room for days, waiting for a room, he added.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will have been out of office for over two years _ and 80 years old _ when a library housing his papers and recalling his time in office opens on a cactus-covered hillside northwest of here, if all goes according to plan. Officials originally hoped to make it the first presidential library to open while the president it honors was still in office, but those intentions were scuttled by years of controversy and delay. Nonetheless, plans are moving now. The city council of <LOCATION> Simi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, which must provide water and sewer service to the site on a cactus-covered hillside northwest of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, gave its approval this week. `` Everything is chugging along pretty nicely,'' said <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Rock </PERSON>, a city council member. `` It looks like we're going to go ahead on it.'' <LOCATION> Ventura </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, which must grant a conditional use permit for construction, will hold an environmental hearing Aug. 31. `` We do n't anticipate or see any snail darter incident, although anything can happen,'' said <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Morehouse </PERSON>, a staff planner for the <LOCATION> Ventura </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> government. The library will be reached by a winding road that will rise from an altitude of about 920 feet to 1,190 feet above sea level. The site commands a spectacular view of the countryside and, on a clear day, the peaks of the offshore <LOCATION> Channel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> in the distance. It will be the ninth presidential library in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archives </ORGANIZATION> system and the first west of the <LOCATION> Rockies </LOCATION>. The others are for <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON> at <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Branch </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> at <LOCATION> Hyde </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> in Independence, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> at <LOCATION> Abilene </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Ann </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arbor </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. Officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Ronald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reagan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presidential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> are aiming at breaking ground this fall, possibly in September. Opening date is tentatively scheduled for 1991. Plans to have <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s presidential library open while he was still in the White House were snagged in a controversy over the site. Efforts to locate the library on the campus of <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Palo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alto </LOCATION> fell through in April 1987 ran into stiff opposition from faculty and city landowners. Fund-raising also did not go as rapidly as hoped, and not all of the currently estimated cost of $ 45 million has been raised. Officials wo n't say how much they still need. Even in its new location, the project aroused some controversy, particularly since the part of the 100-acre site on which the building will stand lies within a greenbelt maintained by a decade-old, non-binding agreement among the communities of <LOCATION> Simi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Moorpark </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Thousand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oaks </LOCATION>. The real estate development firm of <LOCATION> Blakeley-Swartz </LOCATION>, which donated the land, originally announced plans to build a 300-room hotel and conference center on 540 acres adjacent to the library site. Officials of the three communities told the county they did not want the library `` used as means for further land-use concessions on any property within the greenbelt.'' So plans for the hotel and conference center have been dropped. In addition to the switch to a <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> site, there have been some changes in design. When the library was to be built at <LOCATION> Stanford </LOCATION>, a separate public affairs institute was planned. Now the project has been scaled down to just the library, with some rooms for conferences and work space for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> when he visits. The basic, mission-style building designed by architects <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Stubbins </PERSON> and Associates for the <LOCATION> Stanford </LOCATION> site has been retained for the new location. An arched colonnade that had been designed to harmonize with other <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> buildings was dropped in favor of straight columns and wooden beams more typical of mission architecture.

<HEAD>Dutch Call For Joint European Spy Satellite</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROLAND DE LIGNY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Western European nations must be prepared to participate in a joint spy satellite program because of increasing work load of American spacecraft, an advisory report said Thursday. The confidential report by a group of Dutch defense experts was presented to Defense Minister <PERSON> Willem </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Eekelen </PERSON> and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> den </PERSON> <PERSON> Broek </PERSON>. Its main recommendation reflects the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>' increasing efforts to bolster military cooperation in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, along with the region's economic cooperation. A major result of such cooperation would be a closer involvement of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in the defense of <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Although <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> is a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, it does not take part in <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s integrated military command `` A truly joint spy satellite program would be important for a number of reasons, and the strengthening of the European pillar within <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> would be one of them,'' a source within the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>' defense establishment told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in a Thursday interview. He spoke in exchange for anonymity. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> are developing the Helios espionage satellite, which costs more than $ 1 billion and is scheduled to be launched in 1992. `` It's far too late -LRB- for other European <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> member nations -RRB- to get a foot in the door of the Helios project'' that began in 1986, said the Dutch source, who is familiar with the contents of the advisory report. The report recommended the Dutch government participate in <LOCATION> Helios </LOCATION>' successor, believed to become operational somewhere in the first decade of the next century, according to the source. At present, the Dutch armed forces, as well as those of most other allies, are dependent on those <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> satellite photos that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government allows to be dissiminated, the source said. `` But we forecast that the work load of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> spy satellites will increase sharply in the coming years, what with the verification work emanating from the INF treaty, and in the near future possibly a START agreement,'' said the source. He was referring to the recently-ratified <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate-Range </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> treaty between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, which eliminates all medium - and shorter-range nuclear missiles In <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, the superpowers are currently engaged in negotiations on sharp reductions in their strategic nuclear arsenals, talks known under their acronym START. `` It would be a good thing if the <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> allies were not too dependent on the Americans in their intelligence-gathering from space, and launched their joint satellite in the future,'' the source said. `` And we're especially looking at <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> for such cooperation'' because the French lead in space expertise, according to the source. The report's recommendations, which have not yet been adopted as official government policy, marked another step on the long road toward closer European military cooperation, a concept strongly favored by the Dutch. Last year, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> lobbied for the formation of a Western European naval presence in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, arguing that <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> has a vital interest in keeping open the area's oil shipping lanes. At the time, the Dutch were chairing the <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, an informal, seven-nation defense forum including <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. The efforts led to the dispatch of a joint Dutch-Belgian mine-sweeping force, which operated under the umbrella of British warships in the gulf.

 <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday began recalling more than 600,000 1983 Oldsmobiles and Buicks to replace an emissions control component that may have quit working. The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said a defective thermal vacuum switch causes the cars to exceed federal standards on emission of gasoline vapors and carbon monoxide. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> said the switch, which allows fuel vapor to be burned by the engine, fails because rubber compounds used in its construction deteriorate after years of contact with gasoline. The defective switch has no effect on the operation of the car, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> said. The automaker said installation of the new switch would take less than one hour.

 Democratic vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, booed repeatedly, told veterans today that <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` can be trusted'' to maintain the nation's defense. `` I have been in the crosshairs of the enemies of freedom,'' the 67-year-old former World War II bomber pilot told a Veterans of Foreign Wars convention. `` I have been there. And I yield to no person or party in my passion for freedom.'' Republicans, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said, `` have behaved as if the flag were a partisan and not a personal virtue.'' The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has relied on `` extreme partisanship and overheated campaign rhetoric instead of a patient, bipartisan approach to national security issues,'' he said in a speech text released prior to delivery. `` The simple truth is this: Gov. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is a veteran, a patriot, and an advocate of American strength and steadiness,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. `` He can be trusted as a defender of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> security _ and as a champion of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> values.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was well received personally, receiving standing ovations when he arrived and when he left. But he was interrupted by boos four times, three times when he mentioned <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>; once when he referred to former President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>. Stopped by booing after he said that <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> had begun the defense build-up, he told the crowd: `` Pretty hard for some of you to accept that.'' After the speech, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said he thought there had been some organized opposition to the speech. Republicans, he said, `` were desperate to find an issue.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> cited <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' emphasis on improving non-nuclear weapons, maintaining a nuclear deterrent, support of the Stealth bomber and a new submarine-launched missile. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, he said, would manage military spending more effectively. While praising his running mate, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> blasted both Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, R-Ind., for supporting cuts in veterans health care programs While avoiding direct criticism of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> for serving in the National Guard during the Vietnam War, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s highlighting of his own military record was an indirect swipe. `` I think that the breadth of experience that I've had, and the tests that I've undergone, some of the things that happened to me early on, in combat, make you grow up pretty fast,'' the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator said Wednesday in a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, a group of state legislators he said included many <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> Democrats. He suggested that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> lacked the maturity needed to lead the country, a requirement of someone who would be vice president. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s speech today to the Veterans of Foreign Wars convention in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> is three days after Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> addressed the group. One of the objectives of <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s speech was to contest the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> contention that the Democrats are weak on defense, campaign aides said. His speech was drafted with the help of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> speechwriters so it would be in harmony with an address the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor plans to deliver in early September before the American Legion. More conservative than <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on defense issues, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> has supported aid to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels, the MX Missile and the B-1 bomber. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> opposes those policies, but <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> has been trying to highlight areas where the two men agree, such as strengthening conventional forces and more effective management of the Pentagon. After the VFW speech and a luncheon in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was scheduled to attend a veterans' celebration at a county fair in <LOCATION> Trenton </LOCATION>, Tenn. In stepping up his criticism of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> has begun citing the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator's voting record on veterans bills. Among those is <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s vote against creating a <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet-level </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> department </ORGANIZATION> _ a position <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> reversed before the VFW earlier this week with the explanation that his earlier position was `` youthful indiscretion.'' `` A youthful indiscretion? My friends, that vote occurred only five weeks ago,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. `` I do n't think <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> can risk youthful indiscretion in someone who could become our president at any moment.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> spent Wednesday night in <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>, where he took a boat ride up the <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and visited a sausage factory store. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> had planned to complete a four-day campaign swing Friday, but it has been extended to allow <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> a day in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> at week's end at the same time <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is campaigning there. Both men claim <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> as their home state.

 A bus company's most faithful customer will get free rides for a year after racking up almost 500,000 miles in 45 years of commuting to and from work. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> gave <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Csontos </PERSON> the pass in honor of her estimated 22,000 Galveston-La Marque round trips.

Ms. <PERSON> Csontos </PERSON>, who never learned to drive, began commuting on May 1, 1943, her first day on the job as a laboratory technician in a doctor's office. Her fare then was $ 1, but it has since increased to $ 5.75, for the round-trip of less than 23 miles. `` I have n't figured it out, but I imagine I have bought a bus in that many years,'' she said. The bus line keeps good tabs on their best customer, whom they call `` Miss <PERSON> Helen </PERSON>.''

<HEAD>City Agency Gives Initial Approval to Ambitious Watts
Redevelopment Project</HEAD>

 The <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Redevelopment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> board gave initial approval to the largest redevelopment plan in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> history, an ambitious refurbishing of homes and businesses in the blighted <LOCATION> Watts </LOCATION> area. The plan approved Wednesday proposes to redevelop more than 1,900 acres of decaying homes, apartments, small businesses, industrial sites and public housing projects. Also envisioned are new factories on abandoned sites, additional housing, a vocational school and shops and restaurants near the historic Watts Towers by the end of the century. The <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> community of Watts once flourished with tire and auto plants and other factories. But it was ravaged after the 1965 black protests that resulted in riots and fires. Although there are nice homes and small businesses in <LOCATION> Watts </LOCATION>, it is dominated by vacant lots, boarded-up stores, overcrowded slum apartments and the abandoned factory sites. In the first step of the project, the <ORGANIZATION> CRA </ORGANIZATION> authorized an aerial survey of a 3-square-mile area. `` We see that the time is ripe,'' said Councilwoman <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Milke </PERSON> <PERSON> Flores </PERSON>, who represents most of the area and spearheaded the project. `` All of this will come together to provide some jobs and increase business development in the area.'' `` This is what the promise of redevelopment is about, helping communities in great need,'' added Councilman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON>, who represents part of the area. More than 56,000 people live in the area and 86 percent of them are black and 13 percent Hispanic. Most are poor, with an average income of $ 11,427. Most residents rent their homes and have not completed high school. <PERSON> Flores </PERSON> said she hopes the project will be funded through private funds and with federal and state funds from enterprise zone programs, in which businesses are granted tax breaks and other incentives to hire the unemployed.

 Dozens of townspeople, many wearing `` Peace on Earth'' buttons, turned out today to greet a <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> delegation from <PERSON> Dickson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>, outside President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s boyhood home. `` We are carrying with us warmest greetings from all the residents of Soviet <PERSON> Dickson </PERSON>,'' said visiting Mayor <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kartamyshev </PERSON>, speaking through an interpreter from the porch of the house in this small northern <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> city. `` We are enthusiastic because of your warm attitude and generous attitude towards us.'' <PERSON> Kartamyshev </PERSON> said he sensed a `` general feeling of comradeship.'' Mayor <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> city, who worked to make the weeklong goodwill summit a reality, said, `` It's been a long, difficult road making this connection, but we're glad we made it.'' He also said the Soviets were suffering from jet lag after a missed airline connection in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and their arrival in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> on Wednesday. `` But we're not tired,'' said <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> interpreter <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vishnevsky </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The delegation then entered the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> home for a private tour. `` It's interesting because he's the president and this is where he spent his childhood,'' <PERSON> Kartamyshev </PERSON> had said earlier. `` We connect <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> with the positive changes in the relations between our countries.'' <PERSON> Vishnevsky </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Dickson-Dixon </LOCATION> summit, beginning today, marks the first time a delegation from a small town in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has traveled to its sister city in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` The people of <PERSON> Dickson </PERSON> are interested in almost everything about life in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, because we have very scarce information about your country and your people, and the information we have is almost entirely about politics,'' he said. First on the agenda today for <LOCATION> Kardamyshev </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Vishnevsky </PERSON> and journalist <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ivanov </PERSON> was a private tour of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s boyhood home with Mayor <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, great-great-great-grandson of the town's founder The two-story frame house on the south side is where <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> `` Dutch'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, son of a shoe salesman and a dress maker, lived from 1920 until he left for college in 1928. Born in nearby <LOCATION> Tampico </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> moved to <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> with his family when he was 9, and it was here that he began to show an interest in drama, politics and athletics. `` We want to give them a feeling for the community where the president came from,'' <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> said. `` We want to show them what kind of community impacted on his personality and ultimately on his presidency.'' Storefront signs proclaim `` Peace on Earth'' written in English and <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION>, and buildings display flags of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> officials also hoped to impress the Soviets with their 7 miles of petunia-lined streets, scenic <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> setting and the friendly, hard-working, peace-loving residents in the town of 15,700. Not everything has gone smoothly. <PERSON> Ivanov </PERSON> dryly noted that the visitors had to wait in line two hours in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> before getting their passports and visas checked, and missed a flight to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` It's beautiful here,'' he said, `` but your bureaucracy is much worse than ours.'' <PERSON> Dickson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>, is a city of 5,000 on the <LOCATION> Taimyr </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> in extreme northern <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>, above the <LOCATION> Arctic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Circle </LOCATION>, and boasts of being the northernmost community in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The city, a staging area for early Arctic explorers, is named for <PERSON> Oskar </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickson </PERSON>, a 19th century Swedish merchant who provided supplies for the expeditions. Its Illinois sister-city was founded as a Rock River ferry-boat crossing in 1830 by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>. Pioneers battled Indians for control of the fertile river valley and a fort was established to preserve peace. One member of its militia was <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dickson </PERSON> established a sister-city relationship in early 1987. But <PERSON> Dickson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>, was closed to visitors from other countries until last year, its officials said.

 Authorities said today they have arrested a former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldier and charged him with espionage for leading an international spy ring that sold military secrets to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> over the past 10 years. Chief Federal Prosecutor <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Rebmann </PERSON> said the charges against former Army Sgt. <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> involved an `` especially grave case'' of supplying <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> defense secrets to the Soviets through the spy ring. The most recent delivery took place last month in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Rebmann </PERSON> said. `` We ca n't exclude the possibility that millions of dollars are involved'' in the case, said <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Prechtel </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> Rebmann </PERSON>. He said it was too soon to say exacly what damage was done to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, `` We understand that there has been an apprehension by West German authorities, but do not consider it appropriate to comment at this time.'' But <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Milt </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahlerich </PERSON> said: `` This is a very significant matter. The interest to this country is acute. It is a matter of intense interest to the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>.'' Authorities in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> said today they have detained two Hungarian-born brothers who confessed to working for the <LOCATION> Hungarian </LOCATION> secret service and who apparently were members of an international spy ring. <PERSON> Sven-Olof </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakansson </PERSON>, chief prosecutor of the <LOCATION> Goteborg </LOCATION> district, said the men, both physicians who immigrated in the 1960s, were detained on Tuesday with radios and coded messages. `` We have worked in cooperation with German police because it was very important to arrest these people at the same time so they could not warn each other,'' said <PERSON> Torsten </PERSON> <PERSON> Bjorkhede </PERSON>, chief of the Swedish security police. <PERSON> Prechtel </PERSON> said the arrested Swedes were suspected of being part of the same ring, which he said was based in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and used couriers from <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hakansson </PERSON> said the suspected spies had traveled several times to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Prechtel, said in a telephone interview that he could n't rule out the possibility the charge of espionage against <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> might be raised to treason. The spokesman said <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> was `` the head'' of the ring. <PERSON> Prechtel </PERSON> said <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> was from <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, but he could not provide the hometown. The statement came after <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported today that Swedish and West German authorities had arrested eight people involved in a spy ring that supplied secret military documents to the Soviets for at least 10 years. <PERSON> Prechtel </PERSON>, speaking from his office in the city of <LOCATION> Karlsruhe </LOCATION>, confirmed virtually all of the Times report on the case. He confirmed that documents concerning <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> defense plans for <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> were believed stolen as well as the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> contingency plans for a ground war in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> against the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. But he emphasized that officials were still conducting in-depth investigations to determine exactly what was missing. <PERSON> Prechtel </PERSON> said that while `` several'' people had been taken into custody or arrested, he could not confirm that the number was eight. The ring was based in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, while couriers were based in neutral <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, the spokesman also confirmed. <PERSON> Rebmann </PERSON> said <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> sold secret documents to `` a Soviet bloc secret service.'' <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> has been sent to investigative detention following his appearance before a special panel of the <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> German </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Rebmann </PERSON>'s office said. <PERSON> Rebmann </PERSON>'s statement said that <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> had worked for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military for 20 years before his discharge in 1985. It said he was born in 1947, but did not give his hometown in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Principals in the newly uncovered ring, which operated through a German-Hungarian connection, caused a major security loss to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, according to the Times report, later confirmed by <PERSON> Rebmann </PERSON>. The report said investigators believe the spy ring provided American, West German and <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> secrets to the <LOCATION> Hungarian </LOCATION> intelligence agency. The Hungarians then shared the secrets with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, officials told the Times. The Times said the network was uncovered by West German and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, including agents from the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. The Army has about 250,000 military personnel in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> at more than 200 installations. <PERSON> Rebmann </PERSON>'s written statement said the charge against <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> was `` compelling suspicion of espionage activities in an especially grave case.'' The statement said that in the seven years before his 1985 discharge, <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> had access to military defense plans at a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> base in the West German city of <LOCATION> Bad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kreuznach </LOCATION>. `` The accused is under compelling suspicion of having delivered these documents to a <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bloc </LOCATION> secret service by means of a command officer and couriers living abroad in return for high payment,'' the statement said.

<HEAD>Police Promise to Investigate Wrong Arrests in Vice Sweep</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Police said Thursday they were investigating the arrests of teen-agers wrongfully accused of prostitution during a vice sweep. A senior officer was assigned to head the internal police investigation, said Deputy Commissioner <PERSON> Godwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mabika </PERSON>. Helmeted riot police and uniformed patrolmen rounded up young women in downtown <LOCATION> Harare </LOCATION> this week as part of a drive against street crime and prostitution. But police confirmed that vacationing schoolgirls, teen-agers going to a movie theater and at least one foreign tourist were caught in the sweep. They were among some 150 girls and young women detained in communal cells at the central police station in <LOCATION> Harare </LOCATION>. Police did not say how many of the 150 were wrongly arrested. Press reports said many of those arrested, including one 14-year-old girl, were made to sign `` admission of guilt'' papers and pay fines to secure their release. Teen-agers were denied access to legal advice, the reports said. <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>'s biggest daily, The <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>, Thursday attributed arrests of innocent bystanders to `` bungling'' by police. It quoted legislator <PERSON> Sydney </PERSON> <PERSON> Malunga </PERSON> as saying police sweeps violated human rights. Several thousand women have been arrested in periodic police operations against prostitution since independence in 1980.

 New wildfires ignited as hundreds of soldiers fanned out along fire lines today, while a huge blaze threatened one of Yellowstone National Park's most scenic areas and flames came within a mile of a nuclear missile silo in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, Gov. <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldschmidt </PERSON> declared an emergency Wednesday night, clearing the way for deployment of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> to help fight raging fires. Crews also struggled against blazes in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Boise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interagency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, which coordinates firefighting in the West and <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, said 66,000 fires have blackened 3.3 million acres in drought-plagued 1988, 300,000 acres more than in 1986, considered the region's worst year. `` Obviously, we've got a wild year here,'' said spokeswoman <PERSON> Bernie </PERSON> <PERSON> Pineda </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, fire broke out Wednesday afternoon a half-mile from a Minuteman II nuclear missile site between <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lewistown </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> said. The blaze more than doubled to 900 acres overnight, but <PERSON> Zail </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>, dispatcher for the <ORGANIZATION> Helena </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, said, `` The missile silo is completely secure.'' About 240 firefighters were in the area, and the fire was expected to be contained by tonight, he said. <ORGANIZATION> Malmstrom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> sent military police and firefighters to protect the silo Wednesday afternoon but withdrew them during the night, Capt. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Planalp </PERSON> said this morning. `` There is really nothing above ground that's flammable,'' <PERSON> Planalp </PERSON> said. Firefighters in <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> hoped for continued low winds to help keep the 108,300-acre North Fork fire from moving the one mile to an evacuated campground and hotel complex. The fire grew 10,000 acres overnight and expanded north into stands of pine, but did not get any closer to about cabins. About 360 visitors were evacuated Wednesday as flames advanced to within 1 -LCB- miles of the Canyon compound. `` It's a hassle,'' said visitor <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentz </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Prineville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION> `` I just hope I do n't have to go through this kind of thing again.'' The evacuation left only firefighters and reporters to contend with the heavy smoke that obscured the sun and veiled views of the 308-foot Lower Falls and 109-foot Upper Falls. Ten fires involving 355,000 acres were burning in <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>, closing five other campgrounds, the <LOCATION> Grant </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> hotel area and the south entrance. Firefighters at the 156,500-acre Clover-Mist fire in northeastern <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> received aid from 635 soldiers from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lewis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, who took over mop-up work on the fire's east flank in the Shoshone National Forest. To the south in Grand Teton National Park and the <ORGANIZATION> Bridger-Teton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>, firefighters planned to guide a 16,000-acre fire toward <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>'s southern border, where they hoped it would join two other blazes and consume all available fuel. To the east, <ORGANIZATION> Bighorn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> officials hoped to contain an 11,000-acre fire by tonight. In southern <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, about 600 more firefighters headed for the 28,000-acre Storm Creek fire in the Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness. Management of the firefighting was handed over Wednesday to a top-level team from <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. Commander <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Liebersbach </PERSON> said the fire gained between 500 and 1,000 acres on its southern flank Wednesday and was 4 miles from <LOCATION> Cooke </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, 3 miles closer than Tuesday. He said a ridge separated the fire and the tourist community just outside <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>'s northeast gate. Officials said there was a 10 percent to 20 percent chance the fire could cross the ridge today. Southeast of <PERSON> Helena </PERSON>, crews neared containment of a 16-day-old blaze that destroyed more than a dozen structures. Firefighters on Wednesday began hand-burning the last troublesome area along fire lines surrounding the 37,600-acre blaze. Officials predicted it would be contained by Friday evening. A raging fire on the steep slopes of <LOCATION> Hells </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canyon </LOCATION> at the Idaho-Oregon line forced crews to move their base camp to escape the flames. The fire mushroomed Wednesday from 1,200 acres to 2,000, making a run into a stand of timber containing 12 million board feet of wood. <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>'s state forester, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, requested <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> aircraft to help map the fires. No ground troops were immediately called out in the governor's emergency order, which applied only to southwest Oregon A fire at <ORGANIZATION> Ward </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canyon </ORGANIZATION> in northeastern <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> grew to 2,000 acres today, forcing 220 firefighters to abandon the fight and consider moving their threatened camp. About 200 firefighters also battled a 1,000-acre fire in Crater Lake National Park and adjacent land. A blaze at <LOCATION> Walker </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> northeast of Grants Pass burned 650 acres by late Wednesday, and authorities drew up contingency evacuation plans for residents. Lightning storms Tuesday peppered southwestern <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, starting at least 60 fires. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state, winds whipped a fire seven miles northwest of <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> from 50 to 250 acres overnight, while more than firefighters worked to contain a nearby 500-acre blaze. Near <LOCATION> Cloverdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, about 65 miles north of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, a grass fire set off by a welder's torch burned a barn and charred some 2,000 acres in steep terrain. The fire was advancing toward a nearby subdivision.

Two people were charged with disorderly conduct Wednesday in this town of 27,000 people that is a landmark of the civil rights movement, after the council split 3-3 on whether to accept Tuesday's vote. <PERSON> Smitherman </PERSON>'s main challenger, City Councilman <PERSON> Cleophus </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>, who is seeking to become <LOCATION> Selma </LOCATION>'s first black mayor, said one precinct did not open on time Tuesday and that there were other irregularities. `` You stole it!'' <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> shouted at the meeting. `` We might as well have been in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` We sit around and let a dictator run things.'' Returns showed <PERSON> Smitherman </PERSON> receiving 3,752 votes in Tuesday's three-way, non-partisan election <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> received 2,769 votes; <PERSON> Coy </PERSON> <PERSON> Darby </PERSON>, a white challenger, received 453 votes. If the results are upheld, <PERSON> Smitherman </PERSON> would not face a runoff election, because he received more than 50 percent of the vote. After the meeting, <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> nearly came to blows with city attorney <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Pitts </PERSON>, and one campaign aide and another man were arrested on charges of disorderly conduct. A second council meeting, Wednesday afternoon, was boycotted by the council's three black members. Without a quorum, no action could be taken. `` This is one of the worst incidents I've seen since 1964,'' <PERSON> Smitherman </PERSON> said, referring to the year he first took office as mayor and the year when voting rights demonstrations first brought national attention to the city. `` That's the old civil rights crowd, and they're trying to rehash the'60s,'' <PERSON> Smitherman </PERSON> said. `` This is not a representative of the black citizens of <LOCATION> Selma </LOCATION>. That was a bunch of disruptive goons and they got what they came for.'' On March 7, 1965, several hundred civil rights activists began a 50-mile voting rights march to <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION>. State troopers and sheriff's deputies, acting under orders from Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON>, beat marchers as they tried to cross the Edmund Pettus Bridge. Television film of the beatings shocked the nation. Two weeks later, a second, much larger march left <LOCATION> Selma </LOCATION> with the support of the federal government. The clash also was credited with spurring <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to pass the Voting Rights Act, which removed the poll tax and other legal barriers that had discouraged black voter registration. <PERSON> Smitherman </PERSON> said he planned to file a lawsuit to certify the election results. Arrested after Wednesday's council clash were the Rev. <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Swift </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, 42, one of <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>'s campaign workers; and <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 21. <PERSON> Pitts </PERSON> said both men shouted at him and threatened him. <PERSON> Swift </PERSON> was arrested a second time when, released from jail, he returned to City Hall and shouted at the mayor that he was `` still a crook because you had people crooked at the polls.'' Later, a policeman was stationed in front of <PERSON> Smitherman </PERSON>'s office and extra patrols were scheduled for his home.

 <PERSON> Muhammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON>, the boxer who dubbed himself `` the greatest,'' is receiving blood-cleansing treatments from a doctor he calls the greatest in the world. The 46-year-old former heavyweight champion walked into a hospital waiting room Wednesday throwing jabs in the air minutes after undergoing an eight-hour blood treatment to relieve slurred speech and tremors that have plagued him in recent years. The doctor blames <PERSON> Ali </PERSON>'s condition on household pesticide poisoning and not blows to the head. `` I feel like I can fight -LRB- heavyweight champ <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> said in a hoarse voice slightly above a whisper at <ORGANIZATION> Hilton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Head </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> referred questions to his physician, <PERSON> Rajko </PERSON> <PERSON> Medenica </PERSON>, an immunologist who specializes in cancer and blood disorders. <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> underwent plasmapheresis, during which his plasma was removed and replaced with an artificial product prepared by <PERSON> Medenica </PERSON>. Plasma is the fluid in which other components of the blood circulate in the body. Although <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> has been diagnosed as having parkinsonian syndrome, possibly brought on by blows to the head during his boxing career, <PERSON> Medenica </PERSON> disagrees. Calling it `` The Muhammad Ali Syndrome,'' he blamed household pesticide poisoning, which probably affected him so severely because of his rapid metabolism when he was in peak physical condition. <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> likely will return for treatments every three months or so, <PERSON> Medenica </PERSON> said. `` My goal is to remove the circulating toxins. By the end of the year, he should be much better,'' he said. Although <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> had trouble speaking, he moved with ease and appeared to be in good spirits. <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> called <PERSON> Medenica </PERSON> the greatest doctor in the world. `` He's got methods I've never seen before,'' he said.

 Members of the anti-apartheid <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> walked out of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday to protest a government manuever aimed at pushing through controversial legislation. One of the bills would strengthen enforcement of the Group Areas Act, which mandates racially segregated residential areas. Another would give authorities more powers to evict black squatters. President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> holds an overwhelming majority in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>'s white chamber and is able to gain support for most legislation from the majority parties in the two smaller chambers, one for Asians and one for people of mixed-race. The two non-white chambers, however, have refused to consider the current bills, insisting instead on total repeal of the Group Areas Act. The black majority is excluded from <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and has no vote in national affairs. The leader of the white chamber, F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, announced Thursday that parliamentary rules would be suspended so the six pending bills could be dealt with solely by the white legislators. Progressive Federal members said the rule change made a farce of the parliamentary process. `` You are doing it to pass laws which are repugnant to the vast majority of people in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,'' said the party's whip, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Malcomness </PERSON>. `` If you put them to a referendum of all the people of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, they will be massively rejected.'' The far-right <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which favors a strengthening of apartheid laws, joined the <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in condemning the rule change, which was approved on a 116-35 vote. Last week, <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said 80 percent of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s whites and 70 percent of <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> and mixed-race voters would endorse residential segregation in a referendum. The Rev. <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendrickse </PERSON>, leader of the mixed-race chamber, has dared <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> to arrange such an election. The proposed amendment to the Group Areas Act would sharply increase penalties for violators and would negate a current court ruling that violators could be evicted only if alternative housing were available. Information Minister <PERSON> Stoffel </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> der </PERSON> <PERSON> Merwe </PERSON> said the act was virtually unenforceable at present and needed amendment `` to give people a sense of security.'' In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, he said, wealthy people could buy their way into neighborhoods with de facto segregation. `` We only want to create the same option for people in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,'' he said, noting that the government has proposed allowing some multiracial neighborhoods for people who desire them.

<HEAD>City Council Votes to Let Police Arrest People Who Look Like Drug
Dealers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The City Council has voted to let police arrest and search people who look or act like drug dealers _ regardless of whether the people are seen making drug deals. The ordinance, approved Wednesday, also says such loiterers may be fined $ 500 if they are known drug dealers or pass money, packages or written material to passers-by in an area known for drug sales. Civil libertarians questioned the ordinance, which says someone may be arrested who `` loiters in a public place in a manner and under circumstances manifesting the purpose of selling any illegal controlled substance ...'' A known drug dealer is defined as someone who has been convicted of drug charges within the last year. Councilman <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> said he proposed the ordinance at the request of <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Caudell </PERSON>, first assistant police chief. `` This allows uniformed police officers to get actively involved in the war on drugs,'' said police Lt. <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Kowalski </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, president of the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, said he expected the group to challenge the ordinance because it treads on due process and civil rights. <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> said such an ordinance could be used to harass political activities and could increase tension between police and the city's minority communities Councilwoman <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Ragsdale </PERSON> initially cast the only vote in opposition to the ordinance, saying she feared the rights of innocent people could be trampled. But she later reversed her vote, saying she would seek assurances from Police Chief Mack Vines that the ordinance would not be abused.

 The foreign ministers of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> today held the first direct peace talks between their countries since the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war began eight years ago. The talks were mediated by the head of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. Iranian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> and his Iraqi counterpart, <PERSON> Tariq </PERSON> <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON>, sat at separate tables facing each other across a spacious room. Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> faced them from a third table. The meeting was suspended after 2 -LCB- hours, <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> told reporters. Afterward, the Iranian and <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> delegations moved to separate rooms and <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials shuttled between the two groups and reported to the secretary-general, who remained in the room where the direct talks were held. `` They are consulting,'' <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> told reporters. `` It is not a bad sign, nor a good sign, it's a normal process of consultation,'' he said when asked by reporters if there was a problem with the talks. `` Please do n't interpret this as a sign that things are going well, or badly. They are going normally.'' Earlier <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> told reporters the talks would continue through Sunday. Western diplomatic sources, meanwhile, said the secretary-general was considering naming a three-man panel to determine which side started the war. The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said one representative could be from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, one from <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and one from the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>. The direct talks were held in the Art Deco-style Council Chamber of the Palais de Nations. The two foreign ministers and their aides entered separately from the right and left sides. The ministers did not exchange greetings. Reporters were present briefly and watched the beginning of the session on closed-circuit television. As reporters left, <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> lighted a cigar. `` Your excellencies, I warmly welcome you,'' <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said in English as he led the meeting. The <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> delegation of 15 was seated to his left and the Iranian delegation of 13 was to his right in a triangular set-up of long, widely separated tables. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> chief said he hoped `` our discussions would be businesslike, constructive and, indeed, productive.'' The Council Chamber overlooks <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> and is decorated with gold leaf and sepia ink murals of human progress and abolition of war. The peace process was expected to be long and troublesome. The issues are numerous _ from disputed border locations to prisoners of war _ and the bitterness between the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> and the Arab sides runs deep. Since a U.N.-supervised cease-fire began six days ago, both sides have traded charges of truce violations and questioned their adversary's sincerity and will for peace. But no serious fighting has been reported. Earlier today, <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> met separately with <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>. Both ministers were accompanied by their delegations and ignored questions shouted at them from about 100 reporters pressing against crowd control barriers in the main entrance of the building. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said he expects direct talks between <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to last months, but some diplomats believe the peace process could drag on for years. Arriving in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> today, <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> said the talks should `` arrive at a just, comprehensive, honorable and durable settlement of all outstanding issues between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> accepted the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> cease-fire resolution July 18 after a string of battlefield defeats. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> had agreed to the resolution shortly after the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> passed it in July 1987. The agenda for the Iran-Iraq talks could include troop withdrawal to international borders, resolution of a border dispute, repatriation of prisoners of war, reparations, freedom of navigation in the disputed <PERSON> Shatt </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Arab </PERSON> waterway and the gulf and other issues. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> also is insisting on the creation of an impartial body to determine which side started the war. It has said that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> must be branded the aggressor if there is to be lasting peace. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> invaded <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in September 1980 after border skirmishes. Any ruling on guilt in the war would affect the question of reparations. Official Iranian assessments have put the cost of war damage at $ 350 billion. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has not given an estimate.

 Defense contractor <ORGANIZATION> TRW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> pleaded guilty today to fraudulently overcharging the government up to $ 11 million for military aircraft and M-1 tank parts and agreed to pay $ 3 million in fines. TRW `` deeply regrets that the events occurred'' and has created programs approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to prevent them from happening again, said <ORGANIZATION> TRW </ORGANIZATION> Vice President <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>, who entered the plea on three counts on behalf of the company, said <ORGANIZATION> TRW </ORGANIZATION> has paid a separate $ 3 million to be applied as an advance payment on restitution to the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The amount of restitution <ORGANIZATION> TRW </ORGANIZATION> owes is to be decided in a pending civil case. The company estimated that it inflated costs by $ 3 million to $ 11 million; government officials have declined to comment on those figures. <ORGANIZATION> TRW </ORGANIZATION> also paid a combined criminal fine and penalty of $ 3 million, one of the largest ever assessed against a defense contractor for procurement fraud, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>. In connection with the case, two former <ORGANIZATION> TRW </ORGANIZATION> employees have pleaded guilty to defrauding the government, and one former employee faces trial Sept. 6, the government said. <ORGANIZATION> TRW </ORGANIZATION> was charged with conspiring between 1973 and 1984 to falsely inflate labor expenses for the manufacture of aircraft engine parts. A conspiracy to inflate labor costs on compressor fan blades for the M-1 tank took place between 1980 and 1984, <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> said. The third count charges that <ORGANIZATION> TRW </ORGANIZATION> conspired to charge the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> for operations and labor that were not performed in connection with the manufacture of blades for the J-79 aircraft engine. `` The three counts ... detail a long-standing course of conduct by <ORGANIZATION> TRW </ORGANIZATION> employees to alter, backdate and destroy documents to conceal the falsely inflated labor costs,'' the government said in a news release. The guilty pleas conclude a federal grand jury investigation that began in 1984, when <ORGANIZATION> TRW </ORGANIZATION> voluntarily disclosed that its employees had engaged in questionable conduct, <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> said.

 Rival pizza suppliers are fighting, and the result is that school cafeterias will do without for at least five weeks, officials said. `` It's going to cause a riot,'' <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Smackum </PERSON>, director of food service for the <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> school system warned the Board of Estimates on Wednesday. `` Pizza is our most popular item.'' The board voted to toss out bids on 760,000 slices of cheese pizza and re-advertise the contract after spending nearly an hour listening to two vendors argue over whose bid was lower. On a 3-1 vote, the board decided the bidding process made it difficult to determine which of the two bids, $ 219,000 or $ 229,000, was actually the lowest. The dispute arose when <ORGANIZATION> Nardone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> said it would add two-tenths of an ounce of cheese on each slice beyond the 2 ounces required by the contract, thus providing tastier pizza. The extra cheese would be free to the city as long as the federal government continued to provide free cheese through a surplus program, said a spokesman for <PERSON> Nardone </PERSON>. But the rival supplier said the federal program could end this year, raising the cost of the pizza. The start of the school year may be saved for pupils, however. The Board of Estimates approved contracts with suppliers of Mexican-style pizza and French-bread pizza.

 <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> military observers scrambled on Thursday to assemble the Iran-Iraq cease-fire despite communications snags, suspicious hosts and uncertainty about the location of minefields. All of the 350 observers, drawn from 24 countries, were in place by Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Saleem </PERSON> <PERSON> Fahmawi </PERSON> said. Communications personnel were expected to establish a radio network `` very soon,'' he said. <PERSON> Fahmawi </PERSON> said that since the cease-fire took effect Aug. 20, there have been `` just minor incidents which have been fully resolved.'' But diplomats and other sources said that mixups over transportation, passports, communications and protocol meant that some observers were not in place on Aug. 20. Those who were frequently found themselves with inadequate communications, poor maps and uncertainty about where the minefields were as they patrolled in temperatures often exceeding 110 degrees. Diplomats and <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials said they rapidly are overcoming the snags the hastily assembled force, sent to countries unfamiliar with <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> procedures, had been expected to face. `` They're no more than the growing pains of a new mission in two countries which have absolutely no experience with this type of thing,'' said Col. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Annand </PERSON>, the Canadian deputy commander of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iran-Iraq </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, both deeply suspicious of outsiders and distrustful of each other, found hundreds of foreign soldiers, some armed, landing at their airports with their own communications equipment. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> C-5A Galaxy transport planes ferried Canadian communications troops to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Incirlik </LOCATION> base in <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. The jets flew on to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, but shipments to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> were transferred to Canadian C-130 transports. The delays caused by the transfers were compounded when <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> initially demanded 48 hours' notice and a complete list of men and equipment on each flight, diplomats said. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> also objected to the assault rifles carried by <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> support troops. Although <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> troops normally need no passports, diplomats said <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> demanded them, forcing consular officials to scramble to issue hundreds of new documents. As a result, diplomats said, operations in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> have been about two days behind those in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, forcing the delay of some operations in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. Efforts to set up a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> communications network were complicated by confusion over frequencies. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> approved one set, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> another. Now officials are trying to get them to agree on a single set so observers on both sides can talk to each other. Diplomats and <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> personnel said they rely heavily on the host armies to help out during the initial cease-fire stages. Observers in the central sector said they sleep and eat in Iraqi officers' quarters and depend on Iraqi guides and translators. They said cooperation was good. Observers are using hand-held UHF radios to report to command centers. These relay the messages by telephone to sector headquarters, which use Iraqi army lines to reach the central headquarters in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>. Within a few days, diplomats said, the communications teams should have a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> network carrying communications from the front to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The observer teams have little idea where the border is. One of their main tasks is to make sure that both armies withdraw to the pre-war frontier. That's likely to be most difficult in the north, where the <LOCATION> Iranians </LOCATION> have long infiltrated into the <LOCATION> Kurdistan </LOCATION> mountains to fight alongside Tehran-backed Kurdish guerrillas. The Iraqis are still battling the rebels in the region. The 730-mile border has been in dispute for decades and will have to be ironed out in the peace talks in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. The Iranians consider the southern border to be the median line of the Shatt <PERSON> Al-Arab </PERSON> waterway under a 1975 agreement. But President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> tore up that treaty days before the war erupted in September 1980 and is likely to claim sovereignty over the whole waterway, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s only outlet to the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. With only 350 men, the observers can not spot every incident. But they will check reports of violations and significant troop movements along the front, which ranges from rugged mountains in the north through ravine-cut hills in the center to marshes and desert in the south. `` Mines are the biggest problem,'' said Capt. <PERSON> Arne </PERSON> <PERSON> Ophus </PERSON>, a Norwegian observer. `` We have to be careful.'' The guides who accompany the observers in their air-conditioned land cruisers do n't know where all the minefields are because many were planted by Iranians.

 Forget the radio weatherman: A new sculpture installed downtown gives a multimedia performance along with the forecast. The <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> Weather Machine comes to life at noon. It sprays water, blinks lights, plays a trumpet fanfare and releases one of three weather symbols from a steel globe _ a gold-leaf sun for clear days, a silvery blue heron for precipitation, and a roaring copper dragon for a storm. The 30-foot sculpture also includes a weathervane for wind direction and a series of lights that indicate the temperature. To show air quality, a lens glows green on clear days, amber on hazy days and red on smoggy ones. Some 500 people attended the sculpture's unveiling Wednesday by another famous weather performer, <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Today Show.'' `` The Weather Machine will help us recognize and celebrate the weather in a unique, fun way,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>, executive director of Pioneer Courthouse Square. The contraption, which had been in the works for nearly five years, was designed by four local artists.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Hyatt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotels </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday announced that it had dropped its ban on cornrow hairstyles and initiated a program to encourage more minorities to enter the hotel and resort management industry. The changes stem from complaints by several Hyatt employees across the country, including one in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, that prohibiting the tightly braided hairstyle discriminated against blacks, who consider cornrows part of their ethnic heritage. Officials of the <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said at a news conference with Hyatt executives that because of the policy change it has decided not file a complaint against the chain. `` They -LRB- Hyatt officials -RRB- exhibited a spirit of cooperation like no other we've seen,'' said <PERSON> Maudine </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, director of the office. `` There were policies against cornrows, but <PERSON> Hyatt </PERSON> has since eliminated that policy.'' <PERSON> Hyatt </PERSON> said that as part of the settlement with the city, it was creating a nationwide college scholarship program designed to attract minorities to hotel and resort management. Under the plan, selected students at 20 historically <PERSON> black </PERSON> colleges and universities who have completed their sophomore or junior years will have the opportunity to participate in a 10-week paid summer training plan. `` We hope to give students a realistic understanding of the hotel business, and to allow for student development through responsible and accountable assignments,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Perry </PERSON>, an assistant vice president for personnel with <PERSON> Hyatt </PERSON>. `` Students who perform to expectation will be extended an offer to join <PERSON> Hyatt </PERSON> as a management trainee upon graduation.''

 Authorities on Thursday released <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s top dissident and nearly 1,700 anti-government protesters, and hundreds of thousands more rallied to demand immediate democracy, rejecting the president's proposal to consider multiparty rule Dissident <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON> left Insein Jail, quickly organized a rally of about 200,000 people, and demanded an interim government be formed to lead the nation to democracy. On Wednesday, President <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> bowed to three days of mass protests against one-party rule and called for a referendum on multiparty democracy. The leader _ the nation's third in five weeks _ lifted martial law imposed Aug. 3 in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>, withdrew troops from the city center and lifted curfews throughout the country. But to the people in the streets Thursday, the moves clearly were insufficient. About 400,000 people marched through the streets of the capital demanding the government give the people democracy immediately, witnesses said. Diplomats earlier said up to 1 million people marched in the city Wednesday. Anti-government demonstrators controlled <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>, the southernmost town in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>, and student leaders claimed similar takeovers were occurring throughout the country. About 300 workers, merchants and students marched through <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>, and one student said <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>'s promise of democracy was `` a political trick.'' <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON> addressed a hastily arranged rally at <LOCATION> Padonma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ground </LOCATION>, where public stage shows are held. It is near his home in the <LOCATION> Sanchaung </LOCATION> area of the capital. `` We have complete trust in President <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> and Chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justices </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tin </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Hein </PERSON>,'' he said. Both men are civilians in the military-dominated government. But <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON> added: `` I demand <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> and Tin <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Hein </PERSON> form an interim government immediately to avoid anarchy and bloodshed in the country.'' `` We agree!'' the crowd shouted. <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON>, a former army brigadier, was a close associate of former strongman Ne Win, but they split over differences in economic policy. Ne Win led the 1962 coup that toppled the elected government. He began one-party rule and imposed rigid socialist and isolationist policies that turned one of <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>'s wealthiest nations into one of its poorest. When Ne Win, 77, resigned last month as chairman of the 1.1 million-member party he cited his age and took indirect responsibility for violent riots in March and June. He said the rioting `` showed the lack of trust and confidence in the government'' and called for a referendum on multiparty rule. <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>, a former army general widely hated for crushing dissent, succeeded Ne Win on July 27 and moved quickly against his opposition. He resigned Aug. 12 after at leat 112 people were killed when troops fired into crowds of anti-government demonstrators. <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON>, 70, recently wrote a series of letters decrying economic and political decay under the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Burma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, and specifically mentioned <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON>, this reporter and eight others were arrested on July 29-30. <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> was succeeded Aug. 19 by <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>, who had been attorney general. After his detention, <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON>'s name became a rallying cry of some of the hundreds of thousands of people who took to the streets to condemn <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>, and later, to demand that <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> move toward multiparty democracy. Earlier Thursday, heading home from Insein Jail, people shouted for democracy without any official hindrance for the first time in 26 years. The atmosphere was festive. The sea of people and horn-honking vehicles and the absence of police and soldiers snarled traffic in the city center and made movement difficult. Many people wore red headbands, and the national flag was flying upside down, both symbols of defiance. Government ministries were open but nearly empty, with no senior officials at their desks and the few junior employees on hand doing little work. Some local government offices were deserted after they had been ransacked by mobs. Banners on buildings and vehicles, including some government cars, called for peaceful protest to bring about an immediate end to one-party rule. No newspapers were available because workers at all six state-run dailies struck Wednesday to demand democracy and press freedom. State-run <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rangoon </ORGANIZATION> said 1,683 protesters were released Thursday from Insein Jail. It said all others arrested nationwide since Aug. 3 in connection with the rioting would be freed except those accused of serious crimes. Those freed Thursday included 442 students, 78 government employees and 27 <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monks. The release brought to more than 2,500 the number of people freed, but it was not known how many remain in jail. <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> said Wednesday he would ask the party at an emergency congress soon to consider a referendum on multiparty rule, which could lead to general elections. Radio <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> said the meeting would be Sept. 12. He said if the party refuses he and the 13 other members of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Executive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> would resign from the party. In another development Thursday, Gen. <PERSON> Bo </PERSON> <PERSON> Mya </PERSON>, head of one of <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s most powerful rebel groups, the Karens, said a democratic government in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> would be only a first step towards ending the 40-year-old civil war. He said in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, that his 17,000 guerrillas and other rebel groups were ordered to step up attacks against the government.

 Court officials on Thursday postponed a decision on whether to dismiss weapons charges against syndicated columnist <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON>, who has been accused of using an unregistered handgun to wound a teen-age trespasser at his home. A District of <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> hearing commissioner, <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON>, agreed to put off until Sept. 12 a hearing on dismissing charges, to give prosecutors time to study the matter. City attorneys said they would file papers within a week opposing <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON>'s request that the charges be dropped. <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Raoul </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON>, asked last week that the charges be dismissed, saying he had evidence that <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> and his son, <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, had been told they did n't have to register the weapon used in the June 14 shooting. The columnist, who has written in favor of gun control, has been charged with one count each of possessing an unregistered gun and carrying ammunition for it. Each misdemeanor charge carries a possible penalty of one year in prison and a $ 1,000 fine. A local ordnance enacted in 1976 requires that all handguns be registered. But <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> and his son, a former <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent who owned the .22 - caliber pistol, contend they had been told the weapon did not need to be registered because law enforcement personnel were That statement was supported by a memo written Aug. 11 from city Corporation Counsel <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooke </PERSON> to Police Chief <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> indicating that some police officers have erred in enforcing the gun registration law. `` It has come to my attention that some officers in the <ORGANIZATION> MPD </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- have interpreted the provision so as to exempt from registration firearms owned by <ORGANIZATION> MPD </ORGANIZATION> officers or other law enforcement officers,'' <PERSON> Cooke </PERSON> wrote <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>. `` I understand further that when an officer ceases to be an MPD or other law enforcement officer this ` exempt' status is not revoked and the former officer is not required to surrender the weapon,'' <PERSON> Cooke </PERSON> continued. `` I do not agree with -LRB- the -RRB- premise that law enforcement officers are exempt from registration of any non-department weapons they may own.'' The law should be amended to make clear that law enforcement officers are not exempt from the city's stringent handgun law, <PERSON> Cooke </PERSON> added. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON>, who submitted the memo in his dismissal motion, said it substantiates the claims of innocence his client has already made. <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the corporation counsel, refused to comment on the memo, and refused to outline how the city will counter <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON>'s request.

<DATELINE>TRENTON, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>'s system of paying for public education is unconstitutional and discriminates against poor urban districts, an administrative law judge ruled Thursday. `` There are unmet educational needs in poor, urban districts and vast program and expenditure disparities between property-rich suburban and property-poor urban school districts,'' Judge <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lefelt </PERSON> said. The ruling comes after nearly two decades of legal and legislative battles, and once again throws into question the way the state funds public schools. It could force the state to spend millions of dollars more each year on education. `` I do not believe that poor urban districts, even with better management practices and the expulsion of politics, could raise sufficient funds ... to address all of the disparities and unmet needs that I believe must be addressed under our constitution,'' <PERSON> Lefelt </PERSON> said. His ruling capped a seven-year legal battle over a lawsuit brought on behalf of 20 school-age children in <LOCATION> Camden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Irvington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The suit charged that the state funding system leaves poorer districts with far less money than their surburban counterparts and creates disparities in the quality of education. Education Commissioner <PERSON> Saul </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooperman </PERSON> has 45 days in which to accept, modify or reject <PERSON> Lefelt </PERSON>'s ruling. Lawyers for the state and the group that filed the suit, the Newark-based <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, predict the case eventually will go to the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. Although <PERSON> Lefelt </PERSON>'s ruling is a major victory for the law group, the judge did not agree with the group's contention that <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>'s funding system is intentionally discriminatory. Instead, he said, it is `` motivated by cost efficiency and not race.'' <PERSON> Lefelt </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> must revamp the system so poor districts receive more money to improve schools. His decision came more than 15 years after the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> first ruled that <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>'s former system of funding education, with its heavy reliance on property taxes, discriminated against poorer districts. The <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> then enacted a school funding formula, and passed a state income tax in 1976 to pay for it.

 Panamanian Ambassador <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON>, a leader of forces opposed to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s military leader <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, said Thursday a combination of factors has led to a `` dramatic deterioration'' of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s public support. `` <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s government is weaker by the day. The regime is fighting for its survival,'' <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON> told a news conference he called six months to the day after <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s upheaval began with the failed attempt to oust <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> as commander of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s Defense Forces. <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON> continues to serve as <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s ambassador to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, sharing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> position that President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> is the legitimate authority in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> was ousted the day after his abortive attempt to fire <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON>, who retains control over <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s embassy despite the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> government's attempt to replace him, said public opposition to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was evident earlier this month when hundreds of thousands of Panamanians turned out for the funeral of former President <PERSON> Arnulfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>. As a further sign of what he called `` the dramatic deterioration of the regime,'' <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON> said there has been a wave of strikes recently, widespread anti-government demonstrations by high school students and loss of diplomatic support in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has responded by imposing strict curbs on independent news media, <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON> said. `` We do not think that we are in a paralysis. We know we are making progress. We know that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is today more weakened than he was three months ago and definitely more weakened than he was six months ago,'' <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON> suggested that Democratic presidential candidate <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was being misleading earlier Thursday when he said the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration had engaged in `` criminal'' dealings with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, ignoring the military leader's alleged involvement in drug trafficking. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has been indicted on drug charges by two federal grand juries in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. Based on what he has read, <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON> said, `` past mistakes'' by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> concerning <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> date back to 1972 and have been committed by every administration since then. Insisting that it would be improper to dwell on the past, <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON> said `` as long as the administration is constructive, positive and supportive of our efforts, that is what we want.'' <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON>, alluding to the series of economic sanctions the administration has imposed against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, said he is grateful for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> contribution to the anti-Noriega cause. Among other measures, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has imposed a series of economic sanctions against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>.

 <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION>'s leader said Thursday his soldiers killed civilians in reprisals for the massacres of rival tribesmen, and he said the death toll from the ethnic war could rise above 5,000. The leader, Maj. <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Buyoya </PERSON>, was quoted on state-run Radio <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION>, monitored in neighboring <LOCATION> Rwanda </LOCATION>. More than 41,000 Burundians have fled to <LOCATION> Rwanda </LOCATION> to escape fighting between the majority <PERSON> Hutu </PERSON> and the minority <PERSON> Tutsi </PERSON>, who control <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION>'s government and military The government said Monday that 5,000 people were killed, but <PERSON> Buyoya </PERSON> said some bodies may not have been counted. The government said its initial figure came from gravediggers sent to bury the dead. <PERSON> Buyoya </PERSON> said the soldiers who killed <PERSON> Hutu </PERSON> civilians were not acting under government orders but started the slaughter after discovering the bodies of Tutsi tribesmen. Many of the Hutu refugees fleeing to <LOCATION> Rwanda </LOCATION> arrived with bayonet, knife and bullet wounds, as well as stories of soldiers killing <PERSON> Hutu </PERSON> on sight. Until Thursday, the <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION> government denied those allegations. The trouble began Aug. 14 when the Hutu attacked Tutsi in two communities in northern <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION>, hacking hundreds to death with machetes and burning people alive in huts, refugees said. <PERSON> Buyoya </PERSON> blamed the trouble on exiled Hutu he said had crossed from <LOCATION> Tanzania </LOCATION>. But refugees blamed most of the deaths on <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION>'s Tutsi-dominated army `` The soldiers were rounding up Hutus and shooting them,'' one refugee said. `` They are collecting them into groups, taking them inside houses, closing the doors and windows and then shooting.'' <PERSON> Reverin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ndururutse </PERSON>, 32, said his 5-year-old nephew and his 3-year-old son were the only survivors of a family of 15 herded into a house by soldiers who opened fire. He said the adults threw themselves on top of the two children. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Hutu </PERSON> civilians, not the army, probably initiated the violence. Spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said, `` It's a tragic situation'' and said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was giving emergency aid to the refugees in <LOCATION> Rwanda </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Rwanda </LOCATION> appealed for international aid for the sudden influx of refugees, who still are arriving at an average of 2,000 per day, according to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> High Commissioner for Refugees office in <LOCATION> Rwanda </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Rwanda </LOCATION> is the most densely populated nation in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, and the refugees are severely straining the impoverished country's resources <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION> has asked the refugees to return home and promised to help them resettle. In an appeal to diplomatic missions Thursday, <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION> asked for international aid to help rehabilitate the 100,000 people it said were affected by the slaughter. The government said it would need enough tents, blankets, cooking utensils, food and other supplies to aid the affected population for three months, according to a <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> diplomat in <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION>'s capital, <LOCATION> Bujumbura </LOCATION>. `` It just said it had taken stock of what was needed, but did not state amounts,'' said the diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity in a telephone interview. The note did not explain how the government arrived at the 100,000 figure or the three-month time frame, said the diplomat. <PERSON> Buyoya </PERSON> said Wednesday his government was trying to restore order and promised that those found guilty of involvement in the slaughter would be punished, <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burundi </ORGANIZATION> reported in a broadcast monitored in <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION>. He appealed to those who lost their relatives `` to refrain from acts of violence and revenge. Such behavior may reverse our aim of forging ahead in developing <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Buyoya </PERSON>, who seized power in a bloodless coup Sept. 3, 1987, said the victims of the fighting `` belonged to all tribes,'' according to the broadcast. <PERSON> Buyoya </PERSON> said his government would try as soon as possible to lift a 7 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew. The government also has restricted travel between towns and banned meetings of more than five people. <LOCATION> Rwanda </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION>, former <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> colonies, each are about the size of <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>. About 6.1 million people are crammed into <LOCATION> Rwanda </LOCATION>, while 5 million live in <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s second most densely populated country. The short, stocky <PERSON> Hutu </PERSON> comprise about 84 percent of the population in both nations and the tall, lanky Tutsi 15 percent. But the Hutu have ruled in <LOCATION> Rwanda </LOCATION> since 1959, when they overthrew the former Tutsi-dominated government and killed an estimated 100,000 people. In <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION>, the Tutsi have held onto power. The most serious threat to Tutsi rule was in 1972, when the <PERSON> Hutu </PERSON> attempted a coup, killing hundreds of Tutsi before the rebellion was crushed. The government retaliated by slaughtering between 100,000 and 300,000 Hutu, incuding most of the tribe's intelligentsia, according to human rights groups.

<HEAD>Hostages Will Be Freed Soon, Beirut Newspaper Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The 18 foreign hostages held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> will be freed soon, a leading <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> newspaper reported Thursday. <ORGANIZATION> Anglican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> envoy <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waite </PERSON> will be the first one released, the daily As-Safir said. `` The countdown has begun,'' it said in a one-paragraph report attributed to unidentified Western diplomatic sources in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The leftist newspaper, based in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, has good connections with Moslem groups that may have information on the hostages, most of whom are believed held by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem zealots. Rumors of an impending release of hostages have been frequent around the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> since <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> agreed to a cease-fire and peace talks. However, the pro-Iranian group believed to hold most of the hostages issued a statement last week denying those reports. `` The release of Anglican Church envoy <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waite </PERSON> will be the first step'' to freeing the hostages, the paper said without saying when that would happen. <PERSON> Waite </PERSON>, 48, envoy of the Archbishop of <LOCATION> Canterbury </LOCATION>, the most Rev. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON>, disappeared Jan. 20, 1987, after leaving his west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> hotel to negotiate the release of American hostages held by the pro-Iranian Islamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy War. An anonymous caller purporting to speak for Islamic Jihad told a news agency in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> last week that <PERSON> Waite </PERSON> was alive and `` We might release him if the government of -LRB- Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> showed good intentions.'' However, <PERSON> Islamic </PERSON> <PERSON> Jihad </PERSON> had not claimed <PERSON> Waite </PERSON>'s abduction. It also had insisted in the past that it would communicate only in writing and accompanied by a photograph of one of the hostages to prove the message's authenticity. One day after the Aug. 17 telephone call, Islamic Jihad sent such a statement to a Western news agency, insisting that no hostage will be freed until its demands are met. That statement was accompanied by a photograph of American hostage <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>. `` What everyone expects soon is a mirage assumed to be water by a thirsty man,'' said the statement. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 40, of <LOCATION> Lorain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, is chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. He is the longest-held hostage, kidnapped on March 16, 1985. `` Counting on regional and international developments will not be of use at all in releasing the captives in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>,'' the statement said, apparently referring to the recent cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war and conciliatory statements by some Iranian leaders toward the West. The hostages include eight Americans and two Britons in addition to <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Waite </PERSON>. The other captives are a West German, an Italian, an Irishman, an Indian and two unidentified men.

<HEAD>GNP, Inflation Rates Trigger Worries That Economy Overheating</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Government figures showed Thursday that the economy, surging through a stiff drag caused by the drought, grew at the surprisingly brisk annual pace of 3.3 percent in the second quarter but inflation hit a six-year peak of 5.1 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said that the gain in the gross national product, the total output of goods and services, would have soared beyond the 3.3 percent clip had it not been for a larger-than-expected $ 9.5 billion loss in farm production. Without that impact of the drought, GNP growth from April through June would have hit a 4.3 percent annual pace, it said. The 5.1 percent inflation rate, compared with just 1.7 percent in the first quarter, sparked new worries that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> will be forced to step up its anti-inflation campaign by sending interest rates even higher to quell the heatup. `` The economy is growing much too fast,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dederick </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` It is nice to grow fast at the early stages of an expansion when you have an lot of unemployment, but at this stage we just ca n't afford it.'' The 3.3 percent second quarter growth represented an upward revision from a month ago when the government estimated the GNP expanded at a 3.1 percent during the spring. GNP growth in the first three months of the year was 3.4 percent. Strength in both quarters came from big improvements in the trade deficit, which shrank at an annual rate of $ 18.9 billion in the spring, the best performance in eight years. Business investment shot up 16.3 percent in the second quarter, the biggest increase in a year, as companies boosted capital spending plans to meet increased export demands. Government and consumer spending was up as well in the second quarter. But the demand strength helped trigger a sharp jump in prices. After rising at an annual rate of 1.7 percent in the first quarter, the GNP deflator's 5.1 percent showing in the second quarter was the worst since the third quarter of 1982. The big jump in the GNP deflator, which reflects changes in buying patterns as well as prices, was attributed to higher costs for clothing, food and gasoline. `` It is no surprise that inflation is rising,'' said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` We are seeing classic demand-pull inflation where too many dollars are chasing too few goods.'' But even economists who fear rising inflation and credit-tightening by the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> will topple the country into a new recession are not predicting a downturn until mid-1989 at the earliest. Growth in the current July-September quarter will likely be even stronger than the spring quarter, promising a robust economy through the Nov. 8 presidential election, analysts said. And many economists believe the country will be able to escape a slump next year as well. `` We are not calling for a recession because we do n't think that inflation is going to get so high that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> will have to tighten that severely,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Berson </PERSON>, chief economic forecaster for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. He predicted that the GNP would expand at a 4 percent rate this year, the best showing since 1984. He said growth would slow to just half that pace in 1989 as the higher interest rates ripple through the economy. The higher rates have already begun to pinch the housing industry. Sales of existing single-family homes fell 5 percent in July to an annual rate of 3.63 million units. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION> blamed recent increases in mortgage rates for the first sales decline in six months. In another report, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said that after-tax profits by corporations surged 11.5 percent in the second quarter to an annual rate of $ 166.6 billion. It was the best showing for profits in five years, but economists warned that profits are likely to be squeezed beginning in the second half of the year from rising labor costs. The government estimated that the drought will reduce farm output by $ 14.3 billion in 1988, shaving about one-half percentage point from growth for the full year. The impact in the second quarter dropped production at an annual rate of $ 9.5 billion and the government said the impact would be even more severe in the third and fourth quarters of the year. Analysts said this reduction, while slowing growth, will worsen inflationary pressures as well because it reflects a drop in output rather than a reduction in demand. The various changes left the GNP, after adjusting for inflation, at an annual rate of $ 3.99 trillion in the second quarter.

 Applause, hearty handshakes and declarations of friendship and world peace greeted a small delegation from <PERSON> Dickson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>, on Thursday on the first visit by Soviet citizens to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s boyhood home. Autograph seekers and well-wishers crowded the yard around the two-story, white frame house where <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> `` Dutch'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> lived in 1920 as a 9-year-old boy with his parents, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nelle </PERSON>, and older brother <PERSON> Neil </PERSON>. A private tour of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> home topped the agenda for <PERSON> Dickson </PERSON> Mayor <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kartamyshev </PERSON>, journalist <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ivanov </PERSON> and interpreter <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vishnevsky </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. `` I have written in the special -LRB- guest -RRB- book inside that a great man deserved a great memory and I am happy to be at such a special place,'' <PERSON> Kartamyshev </PERSON> said as the delegation finished its tour of the three-bedroom house. `` There are a lot of great men who have come from small and ordinary places,'' he said. Mayor <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> of the host city doffed his straw top hat and officially welcomed the Soviet group. `` They are trying to show us that they are good people and they want peace,'' <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> said. `` I hope they will go back knowing we are their friends.'' <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> said the Soviet visitors were suffering from jet lag, having arrived in this town of 15,700 aobut 100 miles west of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, late Wednesday night. But they appeared enthusiastic when greeted by a crowd of about 100. `` We are carrying with us warmest greetings from all the residents of <PERSON> Dickson </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Kartamyshev </PERSON> said. `` Now we can say something has been achieved with our sister-city ties.'' Many in the crowd wore buttons proclaiming `` Peace on Earth'' in English and Russian. Others had pictures of the flags of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. As the Soviets made their way from their tour car to the house, they were stopped several times by onlookers who shook their hands, slapped their backs and welcomed them. A local radio station broadcast the ceremonies live, including a 15-minute speech by <PERSON> Kartamyshev </PERSON>, who also answered questions from reporters. `` We associate <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> with the positive changes in relations between our countries,'' <PERSON> Kartamyshev </PERSON> said. `` It's interesting to see where he spent his childhood.'' The Soviet mayor said he hoped the spirit of `` glasnost,'' a new spirit of openness in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> society, would allow a reciprocal visit by <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>'s mayor and other Americans to his town. It is a remote, frontier village of about 5,000 in extreme northern <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>, above the <LOCATION> Arctic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Circle </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dickson </PERSON>, named for <PERSON> Oskar </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickson </PERSON>, a 19th-century Swedish merchant who provided supplies for expeditions for early Arctic explorers, generally is closed to foreign visitors because of nearby military installations. <PERSON> Kartamyshev </PERSON> said he no longer fears a world war between the superpowers because of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s recent peace initiatives and said the Dickson-to-Dixon good-will summit was evidence of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> president's success. The Soviets brought gifts for their hosts, including a medallion inscribed `` From Dickson With Love'' and bearing the American and Soviet flags united in a heart-shape. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, son of a shoe salesman and a dressmaker, lived in <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> from 1920 until he left for college in 1928. However, his parents never owned a house and lived in several places during the 17 years they called <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> home. The house picked as the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> museum was the first place the family lived in <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> and it's the home <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he remembered best. The Soviets where shown the bed <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> shared with his brother, the wallpaper in the living room, decorated just as it was in 1920, and they even saw the loose tile around the fireplace where <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> hid pennies.

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> on Thursday opened the first face-to-face negotiations on ending their 8-year-old war, and the mediator, <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>, voiced hope they would embark on a `` path of peace.'' <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> welcomed the delegations headed by Iranian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> and his Iraqi counterpart, <PERSON> Tariq </PERSON> <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON>, and they sat at long, rectangular tables positioned left and right of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> team in a triangular fashion. `` Your presence clearly indicates your governments are quite prepared to pursue the path of peace,'' he said, adding that he hoped the talks would be `` businesslike, constructive and, indeed, productive.'' The atmosphere in the ornate <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> hall was sober. <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> smiled and nodded at the Iranians when the two delegations entered the chamber, but there was no reaction. The delegates numbered 13 on the Iranian side and 15 on the Iraqi side. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> was flanked by five aides. The meeting began about 20 minutes late. As journalists were told to leave the chamber so that the private talks could start, <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> lit a cigar and began puffing on it. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> said the meeting was conducted in English, Arabic and <LOCATION> Farsi </LOCATION>. After about 2 -LCB- hours, the delegations moved into different rooms, where <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> representatives consulted with them separately. <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> said he could not provide further details and added: `` It is not a bad sign, nor a good sign. It's a normal process of consultation.'' `` It was a good discussion,'' <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said Thursday night as he announced the talks had ended for the day and would resume Friday. `` We covered many points and the two parties want to consult with their covernments.'' <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> said the round of talks was expected to continue through Sunday at least, but he did not know exactly when it would end or when <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> would leave <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. A truce that took effect Aug. 20 appeared to be holding. <PERSON> Saeem </PERSON> <PERSON> Fahmawi </PERSON>, a spokesman for the 350 <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> observers patrolling the 733-mile Iraq-Iran warfront, said in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> that there have been no major violations. <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s Parliament Speaker and acting commander of the country's armed forces, charged on Thursday, however, that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> was `` obstructing peace efforts'' to end the conflict, <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio reported. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> will keep its forces along the front line `` so that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> is forced to accept peace.'' Before their face-to-face meeting Thursday, <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> held separate talks with Perez de Cuellar, the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> for about 50 minutes and the Iranian for 75 minutes. Both ignored questions shouted by reporters waiting at the main entrance of the building. The two delegations include political representatives, legal experts, army representatives and officials of relief societies. The talks are the first step toward implementing U.N. Resolution 598, which was adopted by the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> more than one year ago. It calls on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> to cooperate with the secretary-general in achieving `` a comprehensive, just and honorable settlement'' of all outstanding issues. Implementation of the cease-fire resolution involves a wide range of issues including settlement of border disputes and establishment of a commission to determine which side started the war. Diplomats have said that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> are divided over the agenda of peace talks. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> is seeking strict adherence to Resolution 598, while <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> wants to introduce other issues, like navigation rights in the disputed border, the <LOCATION> Shatt-al-Arab </LOCATION> waterway. Repatriation of POWs is also expected to be a thorny issue. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> has said there are more than 80,000 POWs in total. Many of the prisoners on both sides are expected to refuse repatriation because they have publicly supported the detaining country. The all-Swiss <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, which is expected to organize the repatriation, has said it will require a mandate from both sides allowing it access to every prisoner to make sure he agrees to repatriation. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> sources said the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> chief was considering appointing former <LOCATION> Swiss </LOCATION> president <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Furgler </PERSON> as his representative to mediate the talks. The multilingual Furgler, who made Swiss history as successful mediator in a dispute between two <LOCATION> Swiss </LOCATION> language groups, served on the federal cabinet until last year. If the negotiations are still under way in mid-September, they might move to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, because <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> must preside at the opening of the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> on Sept. 20, said <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Nadia </PERSON> <PERSON> Younes </PERSON>. The exiled main Iraqi opposition group, the Tehran-based <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolution </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, said peace was impossible unless it can join the talks.

 Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> pledged Thursday to help minorities `` who have n't really had a shot at the starting line'' by giving tax breaks to businesses that locate in urban and rural enterprise zones. In a campaign appearance filled with Hispanic overtones, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he would revive the faltering oil industry, create a better climate for small business, fight against federal gun control and provide jobs for the state's large minority population. Standing on the historic <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> riverfront in a sweat-drenched guayaberra, a Latino-style cotton shirt, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> touted the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration record of 17 million new jobs, but did not repeat his own pledge to create 30 million new jobs. Some of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s own advisers said that promise was a bit hyperbolic. `` I want to help these minorities who have n't really had a shot at the starting line,'' he said, pledging to do that by creating tax breaks for businesses that locate in rural and urban areas. As he was leaving <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, reporters asked <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> if he thought the cntroversy over running mate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was behind him. `` Yes, I do,'' he said. `` There does seem to be forward motion _ it's something in the air.'' `` It smells like victory,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> added. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> native who has made <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> his adopted home state, made repeated mention of the fact that 40 years ago he and his wife <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> chose to move here. `` I knew that <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> was where I wanted to raise our family and where we wanted to go out and make a living,'' he told the rally. His voice rising, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> continued, `` I was drawn to this state by two things _ <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> was a place of big opportunity, a can-do place, and it was strong in the traditional values _ family, faith and peace and patriotism. I keep those values uppermost in my mind,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also said he would `` put some incentive back into the energy business'' and decrease dependence on foreign oil. And he said he would cut the capital gains tax and keep <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> `` from strangling small business with regulation.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> arrived at the rally of a few hundred supporters after taking a tour by tourist barge for about a mile down the river. He was serenaded by mariachi guitar players. The rally closed with a mariachi version of `` Hail to the Chief,'' and a song that has become one of the Republican theme songs this year, `` La Bamba.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> compared opponent <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to former president <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, saying voters did not want to return to the `` malaise'' that occurred `` the last time a governor came out of nowhere and became president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` We need proven tested leadership,'' he said. He continued his criticsm of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' veto of a Massachussetts measure that would have required teachers to lead their classes in the Pledge of Allegiance. `` I think it's time he let the Pledge of Allegiance out on furlough,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. Referring to the fact that courts have upheld the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> point of view, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he would appoint judges who would interpret the Constitution _ `` not legislate.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made the remarks during a four-day swing through <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, a state where his campaign is focusing with increasing intensity since the Democrats named <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> to their ticket. `` I'm proud to be back in my home state of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, where he maintains an official address at the posh Houstonian Hotel. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s roots in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> go back to the 1940s when he and his wife <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> moved here, and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> began his career in the oil business. Eventually he started his own company, and then was elected to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Ag Exports Expected To Rise This Year</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The value of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agricultural exports is expected to jump 22 percent to a four-year high of $ 34 billion this fiscal year, up from $ 27.9 billion in 1986-87, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. In terms of actual quantity, shipments were forecast at 146 million metric tons in the year that will end Sept. 30, up 13 percent from last year. Both the value and quantity estimates were up from the previous <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> forecasts on May 26 of $ 33.5 billion and 145.5 million tons. Although the report cited no figures for subsequent years, it said export values may increase in 1988-89 due to higher prices but the volume of shipments may decline. The report said the rise in estimates since May stemmed from larger-than-expected exports of animal products, slightly larger subsidized wheat exports, and higher corn prices due to the drought. Noting that 1987-88 exports are now expected to be up $ 6.1 billion and 16.8 million tons, the report said, `` This largely reflects reduced competitor supplies; higher prices for grains, oilseeds and cotton; and increased <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> export competitiveness'' helped by a lower-valued dollar and the Export Enhancement Program, or EEP. Under <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION>, selected countries _ including the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> _ can get wheat and other designated commodities subsidized by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government. The new forecast showed the value of grain exports at $ 12.2 billion, up from $ 11.8 billion expected in May and 1986-87 shipments worth $ 9.33 billion. Oilseeds, mainly soybeans, were forecast at $ 7.6 billion, down slightly from $ 7.7 billion indicated three months ago. But that was up from $ 6.47 billion last year. Exports of livestock products this year were raised to $ 4.7 billion from the May forecast of $ 4.5 billion. In 1986-87, those were valued at $ 3.96 billion. Other major categories included: horticultural products, $ 3.7 billion this year, the same as indicated in May but up from $ 3.15 billion in 1986-87. Cotton export values were shown at $ 2.2 billion, the same as the earlier forecast. Last year's cotton shipments were worth $ 1.43 billion.

 A press plane chartered by <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s presidential campaign was forced to abort its takeoff from a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> airfield Thursday, the third time in less than a week that problems plagued a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> press plane In the latest incident, a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737-300 was beginning its takeoff at <LOCATION> Ellington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION> when the pilot suddenly applie the brakes. No injuries were reported but about 50 reporters and photographers were temporarily stranded and were unable to cover the vice president's trip to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, 49, the pilot, told reporters one engine had overheated and that he decided to abort shortly before the plane reached the critical point of takeoff. `` The indicator lights showed the engine was hot and we decided to abort at 60 knots,'' he said. The journalists were told that immediate repairs were not possible. A smaller group of reporters accompanied the vice president aboard <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Two. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was scheduled to return to <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> and spend the night there before flying to <LOCATION> Longview </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, on Friday for another appearance.

 <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> assured a court Thursday it would keep as assets $ 3 billion, the amount of money the Indian government claims as compensation for the gas disaster that killed more than 2,800 people. <PERSON> Anil </PERSON> <PERSON> Diwan </PERSON>, attorney for the <LOCATION> Danbury </LOCATION>, Conn.-based company, gave a written agreement to Bhopal District Judge M.W. <PERSON> Deo </PERSON>. Carbide was responding to fears expressed by Indian government lawyers that Carbide would restructure its capital worldwide in an effort to circumvent the court's final ruling. More than 2,800 people died in December 1984 when toxic gas leaked from a <LOCATION> Bhopal </LOCATION> pesticide plant owned by <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION>'s Indian subsidiary. The Indian government, on behalf of the victims, filed a $ 3 billion lawsuit against <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> in September 1986, claiming negligence caused the worst industrial accident in history. Union Carbide has maintained it was caused by sabotage by a disgruntled employee. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> filed suit after passing a law making it the sole representative of all the victims and after a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> court said <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> courts did not have jurisdiction in the case. In its written agreement, <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> said it `` has maintained and shall continue to maintain unencumbered assets with a fair market value of $ 3 billion.'' Indian government counsel <PERSON> Vepa </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarathy </PERSON> told the <LOCATION> Bhopal </LOCATION> court that the document was legal because it was not signed. <PERSON> Deo </PERSON> called it `` an inadvertent error'' and ordered <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> lawyers to get it signed. <PERSON> Deo </PERSON> suspended hearings in the case until the High Court rules on a petition filed by Carbide in July.

 Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> and South African Foreign Minister <PERSON> Pik </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> met Thursday and said they were able to debate apartheid without yelling at each other. `` You name the controversial agenda ... we talked about it,'' said <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, D-Ill., who favors <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic sanctions against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> `` We had a good, frank discussion.'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, who unsuccessfully ran for president this year, is on a five-day fact-finding tour of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> is chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Foreign Relations Subcommittee on African Affairs and will play a major role in deliberations on pending legislation to intensify <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sanctions against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Limited sanctions have been in effect since 1986. `` We never yelled at each other,'' <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said after the 100-minute meeting in a <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> suburb. `` The senator has put all the difficult questions. But he has given me the opportunity to put my side. That's all I can ask.'' <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> and other South African leaders say they are pursuing gradual race reforms at their own pace and will not be pressured by sanctions. They also say black South Africans stand to suffer the most from any hardships caused by sanctions or foreign disinvestment. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> later flew to <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>, where he conferred with two leaders of the anti-apartheid <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, including <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Suzman </PERSON>, the longest-serving member of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Suzman </PERSON> opposes sanctions. On Friday, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> plans to visit Crossroads, a black shantytown near <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>. His visit will coincide with one by President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, who will be making his first official trip to Crossroads. By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services. A pro-government newspaper, The Citizen, editorialized Thursday that <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> `` came here determined to find justification for sanctions.'' `` But then Americans do tend to have a simplistic _ should we say a <ORGANIZATION> Simple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Simon </ORGANIZATION> _ approach to other countries, and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> is probably the worst example of this American madness to recreate countries in their own image,'' the newspaper said. Earlier in his trip, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> visited several black townships and met with black leaders such as Anglican Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>. The senator's request to meet with imprisoned <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> was rejected by the government.

The official said no group claimed the attacks, but the two bombs were of a type used by <ORGANIZATION> Terra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lliure </ORGANIZATION>, which seeks independence for <LOCATION> Catalonia </LOCATION> and has carried out frequent attacks in <LOCATION> Barcelona </LOCATION>, capital of the autonomous region. In the Basque country, <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> claimed responsibility for the Aug. 21 car bomb that exploded as two civil guards drove by in their patrol car, killing them instantly and slightly injuring a woman and her young child in a nearby apartment. In notes to several Basque newspapers and radio stations, <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> rejected the government's condition that the group lay down its weapons before beginning negotiations to end separatist attacks. The government also has said it will not talk to <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> until the group releases businessman <PERSON> Emiliano </PERSON> <PERSON> Revilla </PERSON>, who was kidnapped outside his <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> home six months ago. <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION>, whose name stands for Homeland and <ORGANIZATION> Liberty </ORGANIZATION> in the Basque language, seeks independence for the three-province Basque region and <LOCATION> Navarre </LOCATION>, the neighboring region where the attack took place. <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> has claimed responsibility for killing more than 600 people, mostly civil guard, military and police officers, since taking up arms in 1968. It has killed eight people this year.

 Corporations' after-tax profits shot up 11.5 percent from April through June, the biggest advance in five years, the government reported Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said that after-tax profits rose to an annual rate of $ 166.6 billion in the second quarter. The increase, which followed a 2.5 percent rise in the first quarter, was the biggest gain since a 14.5 percent rise in the second quarter of 1983. The profit advance was led by increases for transportation companies, public utilities and manufacturers of durable goods, items expected to last three or more years, the report said. Manufacturers of non-durable goods had weaker profits in the second quarter except for petroleum companies, which enjoyed an increase. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, attributed the overall profits advance to the better-than-expected economic growth this year. `` Corporate profits have been the sensation of the year, reflecting a strong economy, rising product prices and strong production growth in manufacturing,'' he said. But <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON> said he believed corporate profits would be squeezed in coming months as business costs, especially wage costs, begin to accelerate. Among the details in the profits report: _ Before-tax profts jumped 8.6 percent in the second quarter, to an annual level of $ 310.7 billion, following a smaller 1.5 percent first quarter increase _ Corporate profits, after adjusting for depreciation and inventories, rose 5 percent in the second quarter to an annual rate of $ 332 billion after no gain at all in the first quarter _ Corporate cash flows, a measurement intended to show the funds corporations have for investment, rose 2.6 percent to an annual rate of $ 397.7 billion after a 0.9 percent rise in the first quarter _ Dividend payments to stockholders rose 1.8 percent in the second quarter to an annual rate of $ 103.1 billion following a 2.0 percent rise in the first quarter

 Military President <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s decision to lift all states of emergency helps meet opposition conditions for fair play in an October presidential referendum But other measures being urged by critics have yet to be adopted, and the critics say doubts persist that the vote will enjoy legitimacy. `` We still have to wait and see,'' <PERSON> Patrico </PERSON> <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON>, president of the centrist <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, told foreign reporters. Gen. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> on Wednesday signed decrees to end all states of emergency for the first time since he seized power in a 1973 coup. The decrees take effect upon publication in the official bulletin, expected this week. His right-wing government plans a referendum on a single presidential nominee to be picked by military commanders, including <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, at a meeting set for next Tuesday. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, who is also the army commander, is expected to be nominated. No exact date has been announced for the yes-or-no ballot, but <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> said it will be in early October. If a majority vote yes, the nominee will be president until 1997. If most voters reject him, open elections will be held in 1990, with <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> remaining in place until then. Opposition parties and the local <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> set four basic conditions for a fair ballot: high voter registration; an end to the states of emergency; equal access to the mass media, and a vote free of fraud and intimidation. By mid-August more than 7 million of <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s 8 million eligible voters had registered, thus resolving the first condition The second condition was met, at least formally, by Wednesday's decrees Under the emergency states, the right to assembly and freedom of the press could be restricted and the government could jail and expel leftist critics. With the lifting of the measures, opposition groups can stage rallies without government authorization. `` It's impossible to image conducting a campaign without the right to gather publicly,'' <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON> said. He said the opposition would wait and see if the government is sincere about its vows to respect civil liberties. <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lagos </PERSON>, a prominent Socialist in a 16-party opposition coalition, said Thursday, `` I'm left with the sensation that this is a cosmetic operation.'' <PERSON> Monica </PERSON> <PERSON> Madariaga </PERSON>, a former justice minister under <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> who now is critical of his government, said the president `` has placed the country under a state of observation'' and could declare a new state of emergency if the opposition failed to behave. On Tuesday, navy commander <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Merino </PERSON> warned that even stronger emergency measures could be adopted if public disturbances occurred. But Roman Catholic Church leaders expressed confidence in the government's good faith. Cardinal <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Fresno </PERSON> said in a written statement that he received news of the measure `` with satisfaction, and asks all Catholics to intensify their prayers for the welfare of the country.'' Still pending is the question of access to television and the press. Television, which is tightly controlled by the state, and the biggest newspapers have provided little space to the opposition. Political groups campaigning for a `` no'' vote complain that their advertisements are rejected but there is intensive pro-government propaganda. `` Under these conditions, the plebiscite loses legitimacy,'' <LOCATION> Lagos </LOCATION> said in a recent interview. Election laws drawn up by the government guarantee each side 15 minutes of free television time each day in September, from 10:45 p.m. to 11:15 p.m. Opposition leaders say the hour is too late for many people and that this still fails to compensate for hundreds of pro-government ads broadcast and published during the past year. `` There is an immense abuse and fraud by the government in access to television,'' said <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaldivar </PERSON>, a Christian Democrat. He said that because of unfair conditions, if the government declares a victory in the ballot `` the immense majority of Chileans are not going to believe it, and the entire world is not going to believe it.'' But he and other opposition leaders virtually discount the possibility of a fraudulent count on the night of the ballot. They said election laws authorizing the presence of independent monitors at polling places will make any attempt at direct fraud too obvious. The opposition coalition, pro-government parties and a church-sponsored group each has established a network of thousands of monitors to provide parallel vote counts.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Officials declared a state of emergency Thursday at two <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> psychiatric hospitals, saying patients were squeezed into overcrowded rooms and forced to sleep in shifts on cots in hallways. The action allows the state to begin moving patients to less crowded facilities without permission of family or guardians, said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Osborn </PERSON>, a spokesman for state <ORGANIZATION> Mental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Surles </PERSON>. `` There is no patient privacy, no ability to accommodate patients who are not able to be admitted as in-patients right away,'' said the city's mental health chief, Dr. <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Kellermann </PERSON>, who had urged <PERSON> Surles </PERSON> to declare the emergency. `` As a result they end up eating with trays on their laps, end up sleeping on very rudimentary cots ... and they are literally sleeping in hallways in four-hour shifts,'' she said. Hospital employees would wake patients up after a few hours to allow others to lay down, she said. Though officials were aware of overcrowding at psychiatric facilities in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, they said they did not realize the magnitude of the problem until they conducted an in-person investigation. The city-run <LOCATION> Kings </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> has 160 beds for mental health patients and a current population of 195, according to <PERSON> Osborn </PERSON>. Matters are worse at nighboring <ORGANIZATION> Kingsboro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychiatric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, where there are 566 beds and 736 patients. <PERSON> Osborn </PERSON> said it was not unusual to see six patients squeezed into a room intended for four. <PERSON> Kellermann </PERSON> said she was extremely distressed at the conditions she found. In one case, she said, psychiatric patients were placed in an open, atrium-style emergency room _ sometimes for days _ waiting for a bed. State officials denied a request to tour the facility. <PERSON> Osborn </PERSON> cited patient confidentiality. The transfer of about 240 patients from the two centers to facilities outside <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> should start within a few days, <PERSON> Osborn </PERSON> said. In addition to overcrowding, the state cited <LOCATION> Kings </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> for `` patient idleness,'' lack of privacy and building safety code deficiencies.

 A tropical depression churned over the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> Thursday after dumping heavy rains on <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, where it killed three people and left 485 homeless. The depression, with maximum winds of 35 mph, struck land in the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> after passing 150 miles south of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, according to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>. A 6 p.m. EDT advisory from the National Hurricane Center in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> said the depression was centered over the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> about 75 miles north of <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION>, capital of neighboring <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>. It said the weather system was headed west-northwest at 15 mph and expected to move along the northern coast of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> for the next 12 to 24 hours. The system was not expected to grow much stronger unless its center moved well north of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, forecasters said. The depression dropped 6.6 inches of rain on <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> in 24 hours before moving westward to nearby <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, forecasters said Thursday. Two men and a 12-year-old boy were killed in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> in two separate incidents Wednesday night when trees crushed their cars as they were driving along rural roads, police said. State Secretary <PERSON> Sila </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> declared a state of emergency, and <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> units mobilized to rescue families trapped by swollen rivers. In <LOCATION> Mayaguez </LOCATION>, on the western side of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> authorities ordered hundreds of residents in low-lying areas to abandon their homes. More than 100 homes around the island were seriously damaged by flooding, including two that were destroyed, according to <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> officials. They also reported 67 flooded areas, 33 mudslides, 18 overflowed rivers, eight damaged highways and three damaged bridges. <PERSON> Nora </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruiz </PERSON>, 22, fled to an emergency shelter with her two brothers and mother from her home near <LOCATION> Mayaguez </LOCATION>. She said she had worried about flooding since the last major floods hit the area in 1975. `` I've been nervous and occasionally have n't been able to sleep thinking about when a flood would come,'' she said Thursday. The state of emergency was lifted Thursday, and public schools reopened after a daylong closure. But 485 people in 10 towns were still being sheltered in schools, housing projects and a sports center, <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> authorities said. The depression was expected to trigger rainfalls of 5-10 inches in the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republican </LOCATION>, where flash flood warnings were in effect. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmer </PERSON>, a forecaster for the National Hurricane Center in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, said the depression would weaken as it passed over Hispaniola, the island shared by the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>. However, he said it could intensify into a tropical storm when it moves back out to sea. He said that would probably happen Friday. `` Right now, it's too early to say whether it's going to become a hurricane,'' <PERSON> Zimmer </PERSON> added. Depressions are upgraded to tropical storms when their maximum sustained winds reach 39 mph and to hurricanes when maxium sustained winds hit 74 mph. Two tropical storms have developed so far in the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> during this year's hurricane season, but neither reached hurricane strength. The season runs from June 1 to Nov. 30. Meanwhile, a second depression that formed near the <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Verde </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> off <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> died Thursday in the distant <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> about 1,550 miles from <LOCATION> Bermuda </LOCATION>, forecasters said.

 Two sports agents charged with racketeering and extortion in their dealings with college athletes pleaded innocent Thursday and a defense lawyer said they would fight the allegations. New York-based agents <PERSON> Norby </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON>, 56, and <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON>, 29, entered their pleas before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Marovich </PERSON>, who released the defendants on their own recognizance and set trial for Feb. 27. `` We will defend this case extremely vigorously, you can count on that,'' said <PERSON> Walters </PERSON>' attorney, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gold </PERSON>. <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON> refused to discuss the case. `` In every movie I've ever seen, they say, ` Anything you say can and will be used against you,' so I'm not saying anything,'' <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> said <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON> were indicted Wednesday on charges of racketeering, mail fraud, wire fraud and extortion. They are accused of using money and gifts to entice dozens of players into signed agreements, some of them postdated, allowing the agents to represent them in professional contract negotiations. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Collegiate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Athletic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> prohibits college players from signing representation contracts or taking money while still eligible to compete. If the players tried to back out of the deals, they were warned that <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON> had friends who would visit them and break their legs, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON>. An imprisoned mob figure was named as an unindicted co-conspirator. The indictment said <PERSON> Walters </PERSON>, who heads <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sports </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Entertainment in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, also used threats to sign acts in the music business, including the Jackson Five. Prosecutors said <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON> induced the athletes to defraud their schools by accepting cash and signing contracts in violation of <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION> rules, and then signing affidavits saying they had not broken any <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION> rules. If convicted, the two each would face up to 70 years in prison and $ 2 million in fines. <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON> said 43 college athletes who signed with <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON> avoided prosecution by signing pre-trial agreements to perform community service and to reimburse portions of their scholarships to their universities. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Bozik </PERSON>, athletic director at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION>, said he was `` gratified'' by the indictments. `` This sends a strong message to the student athletes that they can be held accountable if they are involved in a fraud,'' he said. Three of the 43 athletes attended <PERSON> Pitt </PERSON>. The indictment named reputed organized crime figure <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Franzese </PERSON> as an unindicted co-conspirator, alleging that <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON> used his reputation to coerce athletes into signing contracts. <PERSON> Franzese </PERSON> is serving a 10-year federal prison term in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> for racketeering and tax violations. The indictment says <PERSON> Franzese </PERSON> was a silent partner in <PERSON> Walters </PERSON>' firm, and financed efforts by the two agents to sign college athletes The <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>, citing unidentified sources, said prosecutors obtained <PERSON> Franzese </PERSON>'s cooperation in the 18-month investigation. In a related case, California-based sports agent <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Lueddeke </PERSON>, 37, also was charged Wednesday along with <PERSON> Cris </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, a 22-year-old wide receiver with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Football </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eagles </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, who left <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> with a year of college eligibility remaining, was charged with obstruction of justice and mail fraud. <PERSON> Lueddeke </PERSON> was charged with perjury and obstruction of justice stemming from an alleged $ 5,000 payment to <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lueddeke </PERSON> was indicted, while the charges against <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> were included in a criminal information filed by prosecutors. If convicted, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> would face up to 10 years in prison and a $ 500,000 fine, while <PERSON> Lueddeke </PERSON> would face up to 15 years in jail and a $ 750,000 fine.

 Flood-ravaged <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> scraped for such basics as bread, electricity and drinkable water on Thursday. Floodwaters covered about 280 square miles of land in the north, the state-run <ORGANIZATION> Sudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said. Electricity, transportation, communications were badly affected. The Irrigation Ministry reported a slight drop of 1.2 inches in the swollen <LOCATION> Nile </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> at this capital city of 4 million people, and forecast a continued decrease over the next few days. Prime Minister <PERSON> Sadek </PERSON> <PERSON> el-Mahdi </PERSON> has warned, however, that the flood situation could deteriorate again in the first week of September, the peak rainy season. The <ORGANIZATION> Sudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said water covered an area stretching from <LOCATION> Merowe </LOCATION>, 200 miles north of <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Abri </LOCATION>, 100 miles south of the Egyptian border. It said islands in the Nile were completely submerged and their inhabitants had been evacuated to safe areas. The Nile overcame levees in several areas in <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION>, including one containing many diplomatic residences. Military units were mobilized to help stop the waters' advance. Whole suburbs in <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> were flooded. Streets were turned into impassable mud tracks, hampering relief operations. Torrential rains Aug. 4-5 triggered the worst floods in this northeast African country's history. The floods have left 1.5 million people homeless, at least 91 dead, tens of thousands of homes destroyed and some of <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s most fertile farmland inundated. Worst affected were shantytowns at the outskirts of <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION>. The towns, made up of tin, canvas and mud hovels, house between 750,000 and 1 million displaced Sudanese who fled to the capital to escape the 5-year-old civil war in the south. Despite concerted international relief efforts by about two dozen countries since the floods started three weeks ago, lines of children, women and elderly people waiting for bread remain common, even at night. Information Minister <PERSON> El-Sayed </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdallah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> on Wednesday night harshly criticized <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, especially <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s former colonial power, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, accusing them of not doing enough in light of the scope of the disaster. Opposition parties, however, claimed the government is distributing relief supplies only to its supporters. <PERSON> Eliaba </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarur </PERSON>, leader of the opposition in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and chairman of the Union of Sudanese Parties, told a news conference Thursday the government's parties `` distribute the aid to their supporters through their members in the <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, their election committees and some of their organizations.'' The problems have been compounded by the start of the annual flood of the Nile, which already has overflowed in central and northern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> and in parts of <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION>. Luxurious hotels along the Nile have been surrounded by water. In nearby <LOCATION> Omdurman </LOCATION>, many owners had to abandon flooded dairies and poultry farms, making the scarcity of fresh milk and eggs worse. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> on Thursday contested claims by <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> that British aid for flood victims was inadequate. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said six planes had flown out with government and charity supplies, not just one as <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> had said. Sudanese Charge d'Affaires <PERSON> Gubara </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdelrhman </PERSON> <PERSON> Gubara </PERSON> was summoned to the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to be told of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s displeasure. The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> that an estimated 100,000 trapped victims of the flood disaster will probably have to be supplied by air. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Prewitt </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> delegation at <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION>, reported that the airlift was needed because the flooded area north of the capital was virtually inaccessible.

 A small plane crashed through the roof of a print shop Thursday, killing three people in the plane and severely burning one person on the ground, officials said. `` It does n't appear there were any survivors'' from the plane, said police Sgt. <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Plant </PERSON>. Plant said it is believed there were three people in the building, located in a small strip shopping center, and three people in the plane when it crashed. Two people in the building escaped with minor injuries but the third, a 24-year-old woman, was in critical condition with second-degree burns over her face, neck, chest and arms, said <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamlin </PERSON>, spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> Hollywood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. `` The people heard the crash, heard the explosion, and had time to get out,'' Fire Capt. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Halpert </PERSON> said. `` It was a split-second decision.'' <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Barker </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> said the plane was a <ORGANIZATION> Piper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerostar </ORGANIZATION> that took off from the nearby <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Perry </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> about 3:30 p.m. The plane can seat six people. <PERSON> Halpert </PERSON> said rescuers, who were waiting for the fire to cool down, hoped that no one else was in the plane or the building. `` We know we're going to find people dead -LRB- from the plane -RRB-; we're hoping it's as few as possible,'' he said. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Saks </PERSON>, who works at the <ORGANIZATION> Pembroke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> across the street from the crash, said he heard the plane `` sputtering and misfiring up above us.'' `` Next time we turned around, the wing tip went right into the roof of Neway Printing on the other side of the street,'' <ORGANIZATION> Saks </ORGANIZATION> said. `` We had an immediate explosion and a fire that went up probably about 70 feet in the air,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Saks </ORGANIZATION> said he was worried because the print shop contained large amounts of chemicals. `` There is the possibility of toxic chemicals,'' Plant said, adding that hazardous waste teams were on the site. But he said the fire was under control and the situation was not considered dangerous. Police closed off all roads in the vicinity. The accident cut power to many homes in the neighborhood. <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> DiGiamo </PERSON>, who owns a nearby deli, said his son <PERSON> Joe </PERSON>, who worked at the the print shop, and the shop's co-owner, <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON>, were the two people who were slightly injured. The seriously injured woman was another worker, he said, but he did n't know her full name `` She's lucky she did n't get killed because she works right in that back end where the plane hit,'' said the elder DiGiamo. `` My son ran out the front door right away.''

 Masked Palestinians wielding axes killed an Arab farmer suspected of cooperating with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, witnesses said Thursday. Other masked men attacked Palestinian laborers defying a strike order and injured three. The attacks reflected growing divisions among Palestinians over the future of their 8 -LCB- - month uprising Israeli aircraft bombed a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> guerrilla base near the southern <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> port city of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>, the army command said. Israeli military sources and <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> police said rocket-firing helicopter gunships were used in the air raid, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 13th in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> this year. Lebanese police said 10 people, including one guerrilla, were wounded in the six-minute attack on targets in the Ein el-Hilweh refugee camp on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>. Two Israelis, including a 10-year-old boy, were slightly injured when attackers threw a firebomb at an Israeli passenger bus northeast of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, police said. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Yatta </LOCATION> south of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, masked men broke into the home of <PERSON> Saadi </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazaza </PERSON> late Wednesday, dragged him outside and hacked him to death with axes, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> witnesses and state-run <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> reported. Underground leaders have urged Palestinians to halt all cooperation with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities, including working for the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> military government, and have called for attacks on Palestinians who give <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> information. <PERSON> Hazaza </PERSON>, 32, was the third suspected collaborator to be killed since the uprising in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> began Dec. 8. His death brought to 253 the number of Palestinians killed, although most have been killed by Israeli gunfire. Four Israelis also have died. The army said <PERSON> Hazaza </PERSON> may have been killed as part of a longstanding family feud. But the radio and witnesses who spoke to <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> said he had carried a weapon _ a privilege <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> grants only to Palestinians who provide information to authorities. <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> also reported that the deputy chief of staff, Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Ehud </PERSON> <PERSON> Barak </PERSON>, severely reprimanded a senior officer for shooting and killing a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> after chasing him in a helicopter. <PERSON> Barak </PERSON> found that the officer, identified only as Col. G., did not shoot the Palestinian from the air, as had been reported, and convicted him of improper use of weapons, not manslaughter. The incident occurred in February near <LOCATION> Bani </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naim </LOCATION> village. Israeli newspapers have said the officer intended to resign from the army. Palestinians went on strike Thursday for the third time this week to protest the deaths of four prisoners in <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> jails. Merchants shut businesses and public transport was halted, but some Palestinians complained and others tried to reach work in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Two dozen were seen at a <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> archaeological site. Masked men trying to enforce the strike hurled stones at cars carrying Arab laborers from <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, injuring three. On Wednesday in the northern <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Azzun </LOCATION>, hundreds of villagers stoned two <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> brothers suspected of collaborating with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> as they passed in their car, <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> witnesses said. The two were identified as <PERSON> Tahseen </PERSON> <PERSON> Mansour </PERSON>, 43, an Israeli-appointed regional leader, and <PERSON> Basseem </PERSON> <PERSON> Mansour </PERSON>, 35. <PERSON> Tahseen </PERSON> <PERSON> Mansour </PERSON> opened fire, wounding a 20-year-old among the crowd, the witnesses said, adding that both men escaped. The Israeli army maintained curfews Thursday on six areas in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, confining some 255,000 Palestinians to their homes. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said in a message to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would `` continue its policy of selective deportations,'' a <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> aide said. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> sent his spoken message through <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON>. It came in response to criticism from the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which said continued Israeli deportations could threaten relations between <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Since the start of the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> uprising, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has deported 33 Palestinians and ordered another 25 expelled. `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> is not responsible for order here _ we are,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said in remarks broadcast by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio.

 A mobile home carrying American handicapped children slipped off a road in this <LOCATION> Nuevo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Leon </LOCATION> state capital Thursday, and two children and the driver were slighly injured, Federal Highway Police said. Police Commander <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Sandoval </PERSON> said the children, aged 6 and 11, and the 45-year-old woman driver were treated at <ORGANIZATION> Monterrey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> and released. <PERSON> Sandoval </PERSON> identified the woman as the director of the <ORGANIZATION> Hope </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, a home for handicapped children in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. He said he did not know her name and referred further inquiries to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Consulate. <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Consulate official, said her name was <PERSON> Rosy </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> <PERSON> McGarrigl </PERSON>, but he did not have the childrens' identities. He said the three were in fine condition and apparently would go home Thursday. The Americans were returning from a vacation trip to <LOCATION> Guadalajara </LOCATION>, capital of <LOCATION> Jalisco </LOCATION> state, about 600 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Monterrey </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sandoval </PERSON> said the mobile home, with four or five children aboard, was on a highway on <LOCATION> Monterrey </LOCATION>'s northeast when the driver attempted to turn into a gasoline station. The wheels of the vehicle apparently locked and it slid off the road into a 5-foot ditch. A small wheelchair was found at the scene. The accident happened shortly after 6 a.m., <PERSON> Sandoval </PERSON> said. `` She was driving very slowly. It's just that she had some mechanical problems,'' <PERSON> Sandoval </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. He said the mobile home was being followed by a bus carrying about 25 children from the same institute and both vehicles were heading toward the border at <LOCATION> Laredo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, about a three-hour drive from <LOCATION> Monterrey </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Democratic vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> last week ordered stocks in companies doing business in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> sold after finding his blind trust had invested in them, his spokesman said Thursday. `` He just did it'' without any prodding from anyone, spokesman <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Devore </PERSON> said, confirming a report Thursday in The Patriot Ledger of Quincy, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. The report said the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator saw the blind trust stock holdings for the first time on Aug. 12, about a month after his nomination for the vice presidency. The newspaper report said the trust had invested $ 120,000 to $ 400,000 in the companies. By selling the stocks, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> avoided a conflict with the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> platform, which calls for <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to be listed as a `` terrorist'' state and calls the nation a `` uniquely repressive regime.''. The Democratic platform also promises to set a date for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corporations to withdraw from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. According to <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s financial disclosure form, his blind trust included investments worth between $ 15,000 and $ 50,000 in each of the following companies, which the state says do business in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>: <ORGANIZATION> Caterpillar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Colgate </ORGANIZATION>, Palmolive, <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Manufacturing, <ORGANIZATION> Monsanto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>.

 A federal jury Thursday began deliberating the fate of 20 reputed organized crime figures in what is believed to be the nation's longest federal criminal trial. The jury in the 21-month-old trial faced a vast array of materials, including more than 40,000 pages of transcripts, the testimony of 89 witnesses and 850 exhibits. The 12-member panel, which retired for the night and was to return Friday morning, made its first request within 10 minutes of entering the jury room, seeking copies of the indictment and transcripts of opening arguments. Attorneys then began arguing about what portions of the opening arguments should be excised, only to have the jury send out another note two hours later canceling the request. Meanwhile, the indictment question was resolved when it was learned that the jury already had a copy of it _ along with a roomful of exhibits _ but did n't know it was there. The jury must decide 77 separate charges, basing its deliberations on the complex instructions it received Wednesday from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON>. The trial has exhausted participants and backed up the federal courts in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. One prosecutor became a father twice. An attorney who had been commuting from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> died of cancer, touching off a dispute over his replacement that went all the way to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. One witness was on the stand for four months. `` My marriage began and ended during this trial,'' said defense attorney <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Noto </PERSON>. `` The attention that I chose to devote to -LRB- it -RRB- rather than to my new husband had a great deal to do with it.'' `` It's a monster,'' Ms. <PERSON> Noto </PERSON> said. `` It's an amorphous, uncontrollable, confused monster.'' Jury selection began Nov. 20, 1986, when the first of 1,200 people were screened for the panel, and opening arguments began in March 1987. Since then, one defendant briefly attended court in a hospital bed until his moaning interfered. Another passed out. A third, acting as his own attorney and given to telling jokes to the jury, cross-examined his cousin _ who on the stand apologized for once shooting the defendant five times in the head. The case began in August 1985 with the unsealing of a racketeering indictment naming <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> `` Tumac'' Accetturo of <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, who authorities say is a captain in the Lucchese crime family, and the other defendants. Accetturo allegedly controlled the powerful <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> faction of the family, which authorities say ran loan-sharking, illegal gambling, drug-dealing and fraudulent credit card operations across the state. The government charges the group operated out of a <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> luncheonette called the Hole-in-the-Wall, where pictures of legendary gangsters <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Capone </PERSON>, <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> <PERSON> Lansky </PERSON> and <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> `` Lucky'' <PERSON> Luciano </PERSON> hung. Key witnesses, many of whom were criminals and onetime associates of the defendants, testified about the group's reputed mob traditions: kisses of respect and `` tribute'' payments for the boss; `` sit downs,'' meetings held to resolve disputes; and visits to mob hangouts by luxury-hotel manicurists to do the nails of defendants. Defense attorneys said the witnesses, their imaginations fired by movies and television shows, had manufactured the scenes. During a month of summations, they urged the jury to disregard testimony from criminals, confessed liars and drug-users _ many cooperating with the government in exchange for leniency and financial support. That support, the defense says, exceeds $ 300,000 _ just part of the millions of dollars invested in the case by the government. Court-appointed attorneys have received an estimated $ 3 million. Then there are the $ 175,000 paid to jurors; the salaries of three prosecutors, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> case agent, judge, and extra <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marshals for security; and copying costs for a mountain of documents. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Alito </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who started his job after the trial began, says the expense is worth it, although he acknowledges concerns about the trial's length. `` We will do everything we can to keep -LRB- future -RRB- trials at reasonable lengths,'' he said. According to the Administrative Office of the Courts in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the trial has exceeded what previously was thought the longest federal criminal proceeding, the `` Pizza Connection'' case, which ended in March 1987 after 17 months. The jury convicted 18 men for participating in a heroin ring that used pizzerias as fronts. <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> trial has been stressful. `` Because of its length, I've been rationing my strength,'' he said, calling the jury's patience `` absolutely astonishing.'' Two jurors were dismissed and replaced by alternates early in the trial, while a third was excused just last month after she told the judge the trial was `` making me crazy.'' Defense attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> has the unusual problem of handling his client's interests as well as those of the city of <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION>, of which he was elected mayor this spring. `` It has caused a lot of late nights at City Hall,'' he said.

 <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> is using a lethal mixture of Soviet-supplied mustard gas and nerve gases to flush out South African-backed Angolan rebels from their strongholds in remote areas, <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>'s Defense weekly reported Thursday Prof. <PERSON> Aubin </PERSON> <PERSON> Heyndrickx </PERSON>, head of toxicology at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ghent </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> and a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> expert on biological and chemical warfare, was quoted as saying his evidence that <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> is using the gasses is based on environmental samples taken from the Angolan battle zone in April. <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> weekly is an authoritative publication dealing with military matters worldwide. Soil, leaf and water samples showed clear traces of mustard gas and nerve gases, <PERSON> Heyndrickx </PERSON> was quoted as saying. The attack must have taken place in March or April, <PERSON> Heyndrickx </PERSON> was quoted as saying, because the nerve gases are extremely volatile and would not remain in the environment for longer than a few weeks. The professor was quoted as saying he could n't tell exactly which nerve gas was used, although he knows it is one of the three neurotoxins, <PERSON> Soman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Tabun </LOCATION> or Sarin. The report came as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mediators were working on a compromise timetable for a withdrawal of 50,000 Cuban troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> at talks in the <LOCATION> Congo </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has promised to pull out its troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> by Sept. 1 and grant independence to <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, also known as <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, on condition the Cubans leave. <PERSON> Heyndrickx </PERSON> was quoted as saying he is convinced the Cubans are continuing to uses gases in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> to help win the war against rebels of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> for the Total Independence of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-. `` I'm sure the Cubans will go ahead with this. This is the new military tactic,'' <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>'s quoted him as saying. The <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> rebels, backed by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, have been fighting since 1975 to force the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> - and Soviet-backed Angolan government to share power The rebel group controls large portions of southern <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. The professor was quoted as saying he has gas detection kits captured from <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> soldiers which are designed to measure whether levels of poison in the atmosphere are toxic for man. A <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ghent </ORGANIZATION> team examined patients in <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> field hospitals and found evidence of nerve gas attacks in 1986 and 1984, but none of those victims showed any trace of mustard gas, he was quoted as saying.

 More than 600 activists from East and West came together for an unofficial human rights conference Thursday, while the government confronted workers striking to legalize Solidarity. Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> was scheduled to give the opening address at the conference, one of the largest ever held in an <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc country. But he sent his apologies, saying he could not come because he was holed up with other strikers at the Lenin shipyard in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>. `` The highest necessity forces me to stay away,'' the 1983 Nobel Peace Prize laureate wrote to conference participants. `` I am taking part in a strike to defend human and workers' rights. `` I believe that the epoch of totalitarian systems based on violations of human rights seems to be coming to an end in this part of the world.'' Also at the conference Thursday, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> congressional staffer <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON> announced that the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would soon approve a $ 1 million grant to help Solidarity, which was outlawed by the Polish government in 1982. Solidarity was the first independent labor movement in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc. <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON>, general counsel to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which does research and provides support for Conservative members of the chamber, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> already has provided two such grants to Solidarity. He called on the Polish government to legalize the trade federation. `` Any improvement in relations between the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and the government of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> must be predicated on an improvement in the human rights situation in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON> said. `` I can tell you with authority that this means Solidarity must be legalized.'' The conference opened in a church in <LOCATION> Nowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huta </LOCATION>, an industrial suburb of <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, a region at the hub of the current strikes that began 10 days ago. <PERSON> Nowa </PERSON> <PERSON> Huta </PERSON> is also home of the sprawling <LOCATION> Lenin </LOCATION> steel mill, where police violently broke a major strike in May. The conference was organized by Solidarity's <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intervention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lawfulness </ORGANIZATION>, which monitors human rights in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, and the outlawed peace group Freedom and Peace. It is scheduled to end Saturday. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> was represented at the conference by filmmaker <PERSON> Andrzej </PERSON> <PERSON> Wajda </PERSON>, literary critic <PERSON> Jan-Jozef </PERSON> <PERSON> Lipski </PERSON> and senior Solidarity adviser <PERSON> Bronislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Geremek </PERSON>. Miner <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Giera </PERSON> came to deliver a message from striking miners in the city of <LOCATION> Jastrzebie </LOCATION>, about two hours away. American guests included <PERSON> Jeri </PERSON> <PERSON> Laber </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Helsinki </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Watch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>; and <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON>. Conference organizers invited government officials, including Interior Minister Gen. <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON>. But only a lower-level official from the ministry came, and he made no statements.

<HEAD>Chilean Journalist Arrested, Others Protest Government Treatment</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Authorities on Thursday arrested a journalist accused of slandering a military prosecutor, and other news people stopped work for one hour to protest their treatment by the right-wing government. About 60 journalists also rallied in front of the presidential palace to protest what they describe as persecution of journalists by the military government of President <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>. <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Herreros </PERSON>, director of the leftist weekly magazine <ORGANIZATION> Cauce </ORGANIZATION>, was arrested Thursday, according to records filed at a military court in <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>. He was held on a government-filed complaint of slandering a military prosecutor in an article published in June. Radio news broadcasts were suspended during the work stoppage from 11 a.m. to noon, and many print reporters and television journalists also joined the protest. The protest had been planned before the arrest. About 60 members of the <ORGANIZATION> Chilean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journalists </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which called the protest, gathered in front of the presidential palace for a brief rally. They released a letter of protest addressed to Interior Minister <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>. `` Persecution of journalists has continued,'' the letter said. It said 29 journalists now face criminal slander charges filed by the government in either military or civilian courts. The charges stem from articles critical of <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, government officials or the armed forces. In a presidential referendum to be held sometime in October, Chileans will vote `` yes'' or `` no'' on a single candidate to be picked Tuesday by <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, as commander-in-chief of the army, and by his counterparts in the navy, air force and national police. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> himself is considered virtually certain of gaining the nomination.

 Republican vice presidential nominee <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, countering suggestions that he is not mature enough to be president, said Thursday he is qualified `` if that situation arises.'' As for his youth, the 41-year-old <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator said, `` I'm very close to the same age as <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was when he was elected _ not vice president, but president. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> also said he had answered questions about his military record and that the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> public is `` getting a little bit sick'' of hearing about the issue. `` I've answered questions for seven days now,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told reporters as he arrived in <LOCATION> Colmbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION>. `` We're going to talk about the future. We're going to talk about jobs. We're going to talk about other issues that the American people are interested in.'' The <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator scheduled a series of stops in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, ending with an appearance in <LOCATION> Sedalia </LOCATION> at the state fair. A scheduled news conference there was canceled at the last minute along with another event because of what aides said were time constraints. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> took questions from farmers at the state fair but told them, `` I wo n't take any questions about the <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>.'' Most of the farmers' questions centered on Medicare reform, drought relief legislation and the newly-signed trade bill, which <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> opposed in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> debate but described Thursday as `` a good first step to send a message that we are serious about trade.'' Apart from the canceled news conference, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> allowed reporters to question him Thursday in an apparent shift in campaign strategy. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> had stayed away from the press on Wednesday so attention would focus on his speech to a group of <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guardsmen </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s campaign chairman. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was asked about remarks Wednesday by Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, his <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> counterpart, suggesting that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was not mature enough for a job that was a heartbeat away from the presidency. `` I am qualified, if that situation arises,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said, adding that he felt he had special expertise in national defense and security issues. He told reporters in <LOCATION> Boonville </LOCATION> that he did not regret his vote against establishing a <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> post. But he said he was `` a team player'' and would support the new Cabinet post since <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> favored it. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> had indicated Monday to a Veterans of Foreign Wars convention that his vote might someday be viewed as a youthful indiscretion. But Thursday, he insisted he did not regret the vote. `` I still believe my vote was correct,'' he said. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s aides insisted that the controversy over whether he pulled strings to enter the National Guard during the Vietnam War had faded, especially after a rousing reception from the Guardsmen Wednesday night. `` We think the issue is behind us,'' he said. `` We want to keep it behind us.'' <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s pollster, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Teeter </PERSON>, was doing regional polling to see if the American public agreed. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was greeted in <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> by a contingent of supporters, although some in the crowd chanted `` Quayle's a chicken.'' Some negative signs were sprinkled among the pro-Quayle signs, reading `` <PERSON> Sissy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Boy </PERSON>,'' `` Dump Quayle'' and `` War Wimp.'

<HEAD>Two of Israel's Main Political Parties Merge Formally</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two parties forming Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s rightist <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc formally merged Thursday into a single party that will take part in November general elections. The union was a formality because the two parties have fielded a joint list of candidates for parliament since 1965. But some political observers said it constituted a final victory for the right-wing views of the Herut movement over the more moderate <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The union of Herut and the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> also put an end to any hopes nursed by the left-leaning <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> that the Liberals might bolt the <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> and form a coalition with Labor. <ORGANIZATION> Herut </ORGANIZATION> has 28 seats in the present parliament and the Liberals 13. The Likud and Labor share power in the current coalition government but elections polls indicate a slight advantage for the new party, called the <ORGANIZATION> Likud-National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, and its right-wing allies, over the leftist parties headed by Labor. Before the official union, leaders of Herut and the Liberals signed a covenant stating that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> had an indisputable right to all of the Land of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, including the occupied territories. Former Prime Minister <PERSON> Menachem </PERSON> <PERSON> Begin </PERSON>, who founded the Herut movement in 1948 and was architect of the 1965 partnership with the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, sent a letter of congratulations to the participants. Three thousand <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> supporters attended the signing ceremony, where <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> delivered a speech attacking his <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> rivals. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> charged that <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> blamed <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> instead of the Arabs for the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> uprising that began last Dec. 8 and the failure to reach a peace settlement. `` I thought we had gotten rid of this cursed guilt complex a long time ago,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said.

 A high-ranking officer received a letter of reprimand and four other supervisory personnel were given nonpunitive letters of caution in the death of a rescue swimmer trainee, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said Thursday. The information was disclosed as proceedings began in the court-martial of Lt. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Torchia </PERSON>, former officer in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Swimmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> where Airman Recruit <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON>, 19, of <LOCATION> Appleton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, died March 2. Testimony at a June investigative hearing indicated <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> died from a fear-induced heart attack or drowning. Instructors allegedly pushed <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> back into a swimming pool and held his head under water after he had panicked, climbed out and shouted that he wanted to quit. <PERSON> Torchia </PERSON>'s former boss, now-retired Capt. C.L. <PERSON> Lavinder </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who headed the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schools </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION> at the time of <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON>'s death there, received a letter of reprimand for dereliction of duty from Rear Adm. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, said Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Hessler </PERSON>, a public affairs officer. <PERSON> Hessler </PERSON> said the letters of caution were issued to an officer and three enlisted men with ranks of chief petty officer or above, but their identities could not be disclosed because the punishment did n't go on their records. <PERSON> Torchia </PERSON> and an enlisted instructor scheduled for trial Monday are the only personnel facing court-martial in the case. Nonjudicial punishments against four enlisted rescue swimmer instructors, including reductions in rank for two of them and fines, were ordered by <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> on June 29 and made public then. The letters of reprimand and caution were not disclosed before Thursday because no one asked, <PERSON> Hessler </PERSON> said. He was asked Thursday after <PERSON> Lavinder </PERSON>'s punishment was mentioned during a hearing on motions to dismiss dereliction-of-duty charges against <PERSON> Torchia </PERSON>. <PERSON> Torchia </PERSON>, 32, of <LOCATION> Princeton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, was in his office overlooking the pool, talking on the telephone, at the time of <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON>'s death, witnesses have said. He had been offered unspecified nonjudicial punishment but requested a court-martial so he could have an opportunity to clear himself. Cmdr. <PERSON> Newell </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Krogmann </PERSON>, the military judge, denied a motion to dismiss the second of two counts against <PERSON> Torchia </PERSON>. The motion alleged insufficient evidence. The judge later Thursday heard testimony on a motion to dismiss both counts on grounds the chief of naval education and training, Vice Adm. N.R. Thunman, who convened the court-martial, was biased against <PERSON> Torchia </PERSON>. <PERSON> Krogmann </PERSON> said he would make a decision when proceedings reconvene Friday. The trial will begin if he denies the motion. He has two other options: dismiss the case or remove it from <LOCATION> Thunman </LOCATION> and shift it to another admiral of equal or higher responsibility for an independent decision on whether a court-martial is warranted. <PERSON> Thunman </PERSON> ordered the court-martial against the advice of the investigating officer, Cmdr. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. D'Alesio, who recommended no disciplinary action against <PERSON> Torchia </PERSON>. A guilty verdict could bring <PERSON> Torchia </PERSON> up to three months' confinement, loss of pay and a formal reprimand that could make future advancement in the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> extremely difficult Scheduled for trial Monday is Petty Officer 2nd Class <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Combe </PERSON>, 26, of <LOCATION> Tempe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz </LOCATION>. He is charged with involuntary manslaughter, battery and conspiracy to commit battery. <PERSON> Combe </PERSON> is accused of holding <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> under the water. If convicted he could be dishonorably discharged and sentenced to prison for more than three years. He was denied the option of accepting nonjudicial punishment.

<TEXT>
 Flamboyant defense attorney <PERSON> Percy </PERSON> <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON>, who bartered a guilty plea for the life of the man who assassinated the Rev. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, died Thursday at the age of 86. <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON> died of cardiac arrest, said <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>. Family members did not wish to release further details, she said. <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON> once estimated he had tried 1,500 death penalty cases, but of his clients, only one, a restaurateur named <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, was executed. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> was convicted in 1952 of shooting his wife, and <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON>, who consistently opposed the death penalty, said later <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> `` deserved to die.'' `` You ca n't win'em all,'' <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON> said of the case, but later confided he blamed himself. He persuaded <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> to plead guilty to the 1968 slaying of King, the Nobel Prize-winning civil rights leader, in exchange for a 99-year sentence. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> charged later that <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON> pressured him into the plea by saying the odds were 99 percent certain he would go to the electric chair if he faced a jury in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> contended he only purchased the rifle used in the <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> assassination and gave it to a man named `` Raoul.'' He charged <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON> failed to investigate two mysterious <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> men who, he contended, would have helped his case. But <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON> testified before a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> assassinations committee in 1978 that <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> admitted to him he faked the story of a conspiracy and thought the killing would make `` a hero to the white race.'' `` His style, his technique, his manner of handling himself before the jury had a dramatic effect on my career. Not only mine, but many other men and women in the state who practice law,'' said <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>'s other famous attorney, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> `` Racehorse'' <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON>, who used to skip law school classes to watch <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON> in court. `` I think his loss is a major loss in the quality of law. He's gone but will not be forgotten I believe he will be the yardstick from which we will judge the other lawyers,'' <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON> was born June 21, 1902, in a log cabin near the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> town of Coldspring. His first job was as a shoeshine boy in <LOCATION> Polk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, where his father was sheriff. He began studying law after World War I and kept the $ 5 bill he received as the fee for his first legal case _ drawing up a lease on a five-acre orchard. <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON> reacted in character April 30, 1982, when a woman whose divorce he had handled was arrested and charged with trying to hire someone to kill him. `` I'm too busy to die,'' <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON> growled when asked for comment. He built a practice based on unswerving loyalty to clients. `` They may not always be right, but they are never wrong,'' he once said. `` In a murder case, you should never allow the defendant to be tried,'' he explained. `` Try someone else _ the husband, the lover, the police, or if the case has social implications, society generally. But never the defendant.''

 Opposition legislators on Thursday stormed out of a session to certify a new national House of Deputies and accused the governing party of blocking inquiries into charges of voting fraud. `` We have to seek new ways -LRB- of protest -RRB-, because the official party is legitimizing fraud more and more every day,'' <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Noyola </PERSON> of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> said. The opposition parties, who had left before dawn Thursday after a nightlong debate, returned to the chamber when a new session began Thursday afternoon, and the lengthy wrangling resumed. The House of Deputies is sitting in as an electoral college to certify the deputies elected in July 6 nationwide balloting. Press sections were open at the new session Thursday afternoon, but public galleries were closed because opposition sympathizers had been chanting, whistling, and sometimes throwing coins and other objects. The July 6 elections were tainted by widespread accusations that the governing <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION>, won by tampering with voter registration rolls, packing ballot boxes and destroying ballots for opposition candidates. Since then, opposition leaders have accused the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> of bullying and steamroller tactics to speed up vote certification, especially in the House. That chamber must also certify the presidential election by the Dec. 1 inauguration day of President-elect <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>. The two major opposition candidates have barnstormed the nation urging Mexicans to reject the election results. After a heated nightlong debate, all 227 opposition deputies walked out of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> building early Thursday, temporarily paralyzing the 500-member electoral college. The body must finish its work in time to seat a new House by Sept. 1. On that date, both the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> are to meet in joint session to hear outgoing President <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Madrid </PERSON>'s state-of-the-union address The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, sitting as a second electoral college, continued hearings normally Thursday to certify the election for its 64-member body. The <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> had not lost a presidential election since it was founded in 1929. But the July 6 balloting marked the first time the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> won the presidency with less than 70 percent of the votes cast. Returns this time gave <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> victory and a single six-year term by 50.36 percent of the vote. <PERSON> Cuauhtemoc </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> leader that broke away to head the leftist <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> coalition </ORGANIZATION>, came in second with 31.1 percent. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clouthier </PERSON> of the conservative <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> came in third with 17 percent. For the first time also, the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> lost its complete domination of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Four opposition senators already have been certified for their posts. By law, the deputies - and senators-elect sit as separate electoral colleges to certify their own elections, and then the 500-member <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> sits as an electoral college to certify the presidential election Both <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> and <PERSON> Clouthier </PERSON> have been claiming the election was fraudulent and accusing the government of denying the electoral colleges access to documents from about half the 55,000 polling stations nationwide to conceal irregularities. The de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> administration has denied the charge. `` The <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> members are denying us a voice and are turning down all requests by the opposition -LRB- that fraud be investigated -RRB- in their hurry to conclude the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> electoral college -RRB- process,'' <PERSON> Noyola </PERSON> said Thursday in a telephone interview. <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Jimenez </PERSON> <PERSON> Morales </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> delegates to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> electoral college, denied the charge in a newspaper interview. `` In any case, the attitude adopted by the opposition shows clearly that we are living within a democratic framework and a free world, and each one can do what he wants with his freedom,'' he told the newspaper Excelsior. The House had voted unanimously to close the public galleries minutes before the opposition members walked out, college spokesman <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Trevino </PERSON> said. `` The decision was taken because several deputies were not only grossly insulted by sympathizers from opposition groups, but many had coins and other objects tossed at them,'' he said.

 Too many school lunches rate a `` C'' grade because of their high fat content, a consumer nutrition group said Thursday, urging cafeterias to serve `` healthfully modified'' meals such as chili atop baked potatoes instead of hot dogs. <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Haas </PERSON>, executive director of <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION>, said her group spotted encouraging trends toward fresh fruit and vegetables in a survey of school menus. But she said the main courses served in school cafeterias `` far too often are fried foods'' and other dishes high in saturated fat. `` Our young children are a captive audience. We have an opportunity here,'' <PERSON> Haas </PERSON> said. `` We've got to establish lifestyles that have healthy eating habits.'' The Denver-based <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> called the report `` shallow'' and said `` school lunch is again getting a bad rap.'' The $ 3.7 billion school lunch program, serving some 27 million children, is run by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Surplus commodities purchased by <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> account for 20 percent of the foods used in the program. Therein lies the root of the problem, according to <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION>, because the commodities `` are often high in fat, sugar or sodium.'' `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has compounded the problem by bowing to the milk producers' lobby and requiring that schools serve whole milk, with low-fat milk optional,'' it said. Public Voice recommended, among other things, that <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> set limits on the amount of fat, sodium and sugar permitted in school lunches and distribute healthier commodities to schools. But <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, deputy assistant secretary of agriculture for food and consumer services, said in a statement that `` it would be irresponsible'' to let commodities purchased by the government, as required by law, go unused. Furthermore, she said, `` the scientific community does not support setting absolute levels for sugar, fat or sodium at this time'' because current recommendations regarding children are controversial. `` Nutrition strategies warranted for the general adult population may actually be harmful to children, particularly low-income children, during periods of growth and development,'' <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Bayer </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> report offers a `` shallow view of research'' that is an overreaction to calls by the surgeon general to reduce fat intake. The association represents 65,000 school nutritionists and school lunch directors. `` I think that it is patently ridiculous to blame school lunch for obese <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' Ms. <PERSON> Bayer </PERSON> said. `` The fact is that school lunches are often the healthiest and most balanced meals some children receive all day.'' `` We just think school lunch is again getting a bad rap,'' she said. However, <PERSON> Haas </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> and the American <ORGANIZATION> Heart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> agree that fat should not constitute more than 30 percent of a child's daily caloric intake. And she said the average school lunch contains 39 percent fat. Public Voice listed several examples of traditional menus heavy on fried chicken and fish, mashed and fried potatoes and sweet, prepared deserts. The group compared those with `` healthfully modified'' menus adopted by some school districts. For example, in <LOCATION> Kennesaw </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, students got baked chicken breasts with lemon and garlic, steamed broccoli and carrots, a homemade whole wheat roll and fresh fruit. And in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, one meal was a baked potato topped with chili, accompanied by raw broccoli and carrots and sweet potato pie. `` We hear complaints that students wo n't eat this stuff,'' <PERSON> Haas </PERSON> said. `` We just do n't buy that.'' Some school districts won praise for serving lowfat milk and homemade lowfat salad dressings, buying the ingredients themselves to substitute for higher-fat commodities from <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Haas </PERSON> urged the department to help keep nutritious meals affordable by adapting the commodities program to more closely meet <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s own 1980 dietary guidelines. For example, she said, it could offer schools whole potatoes and plain chicken rather than potato rounds and breaded chicken ready for frying. <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> also recommended that: _ <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> establish a national food service management institute to train and help school systems serve higher-quality lunches <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> replied that the department has authorized $ 50,000 to study the feasibility of setting up such a program in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>. A report to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is due this fall. _ The department reinstitute a ban on the sale of snack foods on school grounds Sales now are banned only in cafeterias or during meal periods. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, citing court cases, said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would have to pass a specific law if more stringent federal controls are desired.

 The ashes of celebrated writer and wit <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> will be interred in a memorial garden at <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in a gesture of friendship between blacks and Jews, the director of the civil rights organization said Thursday. The dedication of the garden on Sept. 16 will put an end to the homelessness of <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>'s ashes, which have resided for years in a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> office file cabinet. <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, who was Jewish, was an outspoken civil libertarian. When she died in 1967, she left her estate to the Rev. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, and, on his death, to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> for the Advancement of Colored People. `` In celebrating Ms. <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, we proudly celebrate our relationship with the Jewish community, reaffirming and renewing our commitment to work hand in hand to erase the stain of all forms of racial, religious, sexual and ethnic injustice and intolerance from our society,'' said <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hooks </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION>. Rabbi <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> <PERSON> Saltzman </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Baltimore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hebrew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congregation </ORGANIZATION> called the memorial `` a testament of good will toward <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, and, through her, to the Jewish community.'' Hooks offered to have the ashes buried at the organization's national headquarters after learning this spring they were being kept in lawyer <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Dwyer </PERSON>'s office Hooks said most people know little more about <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> than her oft-repeated quip, `` Men seldom make passes at girls who wear glasses.'' `` There was much more to Ms. <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> than those sparse and not totally accurate two lines _ her short stories, her reviews, her essays, her plays, her movie scripts and her conversational gems,'' Hooks said. `` One of my favorites was her reported remark when one of her archrivals was described as her own worst enemy. ` Not while I'm around,' Ms. <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> retorted They do n't make them like that anymore.'' The memorial garden will be located in a tiny grove of towering white pine trees behind the chapel of a former monastery now occupied by the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION>. Its centerpiece will be a plaque on the ground surrounded by a circle of brown brick. Plans call for leaving a natural floor of soft pine needles. The circle represents the Round Table at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Algonquin Hotel, legendary for the gab sessions held there by <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> and a collection of the best-known literary figures of her time, said <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, dean of the <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Architecture </ORGANIZATION> and Planning. The architecture school provided the design and a minority-owned construction company will do the work, <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said. Hooks said he did not know how much the project would cost. The evening before the garden's dedication, a one-woman show about <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>'s life, written by and starring <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ollstein </PERSON>, will premiere at the Arena Playhouse in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>. The play is titled, `` Hope, Laughter and a Sock in the Eye.''

 Democratic vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, a decorated World War II bomber pilot, was booed by veterans on Thursday when he said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and the Democrats could be trusted with the nation's defense. `` The simple truth is this: Gov. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is a veteran, a patriot, and an advocate of American strength and steadiness,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> told the Veterans of Foreign Wars convention in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` He can be trusted as a defender of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> security _ and as a champion of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> values.'' While President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has been a strong advocate for the military, he `` has purchased military strength at the expense of national solvency,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said, warning of the threat of the huge national budget and trade deficits. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> himself was warmly received by the crowd and got a standing ovation. But in trying to make the case for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on defense, he was interrupted four times by boos or jeers _ once when he mentioned former President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s name. At one point, when <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> talked about <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` bringing fiscal responsibility and management competence to our national defense programs,'' the VFW's national commander, <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stock </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, had to stand and quiet the crowd. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> then asked for the `` courtesy to debate,'' and received applause. The booing of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> appeared to be led by the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> delegation to the convention. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, a retired veteran who said he was once the Democratic chairman in <LOCATION> Saugus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was `` anti-veteran'' and had appointed a non-veteran to head the state soldier's home. The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign staff brought out <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Halachi </PERSON>, the state commissioner of veterans affairs, to respond to the event and gave reporters papers on the governor's positions on veterans issues. <PERSON> Halachi </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veteran, said the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> delegation included a vice chairman of Veterans for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. He said the criticisms of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> were untrue, and that former Gov. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> had appointed the non-veteran. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> told reporters he had been prepared for some flak. `` I had a tough assignment and I fulfilled it. And I think I really gave them something to think about,'' he said. `` Obviously, some of them did n't want to hear it.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, in his speech, said the Republicans were circulating `` scurrilous charges.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> spoke before the VFW convention on Monday. `` At times, I'm afraid, our Republican friends have behaved as if the flag were a partisan and not a personal virtue,'' he said. He received applause when he asserted: `` My friends, if I believe that there was a thread of truth in that garish tapestry of partisan blame, I would not have joined <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on the Democratic ticket.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> wore his <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legion </ORGANIZATION> cap as he delivered the address. `` I have been in the crosshairs of the enemies of freedom,'' said the 67-year-old former bomber pilot. `` I have been there. And I yield to no person or party in my passion for freedom.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> cited <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' emphasis on improving non-nuclear weapons, maintaining a nuclear deterrent, and support of the Stealth bomber, the cruise missile and a new submarine-launched missile. While praising his running mate, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> blasted both Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, R-Ind., for supporting cuts in veterans health care programs `` Each time the Reagan-Bush administration proposed cuts, the Democrats fought them off,'' he said. From <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> went to an event to honor veterans at the <LOCATION> Gibson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> fair in <LOCATION> northwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, among them about 20 World War I veterans about the age of <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s father, a flier in the Great War. In a talk there, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> rejected a military spending bill because of partisan politics. `` The reason he vetoed it was because <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> came in with his pollsters and said they wanted to be able to charge the Democrats with weakness on defense,'' said <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. Some of the participants were angry with <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s appearance. `` I took my vacation to help my daddy do this,'' said <PERSON> Leanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Hutchison </PERSON>. `` We were told no politicians would be here, that this would n't be a political thing.'' `` This has turned into a political party,'' said <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> as she helped prepare the military staple `` SOS'' _ creamed chipped beef on toast.

 More than two and a half years after the Challenger exploded, relatives of the crew turned the astronauts' dream of teaching children about space into reality Thursday with the opening of the first Challenger Center The center at <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION>, paid for with a $ 150,000 private grant, will give students an opportunity to make a simulated space flight complete with a mission control center and scientific experiments. `` We knew we could n't launch a satellite. Discovery will do that for us, but we could continue scientific and education objectives of that mission,'' said <PERSON> June </PERSON> <PERSON> Scobee </PERSON>, widow of Challenger commander <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Scobee </PERSON> and chairman of the board of the Challenger Center. `` The Challenger Center mission began with the Challenger crew. The idea to continue it was a mission by the families,'' she said, accompanied at the opening by relatives of other crew members. `` This is a milestone event,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Barram </PERSON>, vice president of corporate affairs for <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which donated computers to the center. `` The center and its educational innovations are giant steps down new pathways to knowledge for our children _ and for us.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Scobee </PERSON> and the other Challenger relatives conceived the center as a memorial to the deceased crew and their educational mission. The Challenger carried <PERSON> Christa </PERSON> <PERSON> McAuliffe </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Concord </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, high school teacher who was to have conducted the first classroom experiments from space. The <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> center is expected to serve as a model for dozens of similar centers, or Mission Sites, planned for science museums throughout the country. The planned hub of the network will be the Challenger Center Space-Life Station, a $ 15 million facility to be built in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Throughout the summer, 580 Houston-area students have been training at the <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Site </ORGANIZATION>, which can accommodate 30 students at a time. `` It's confusing. It's very complicated to memorize everything,'' said 10-year-old <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, who sat in as captain of mission control during Thursday's simulated flight somewhere between <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and Mars. `` But I'm very interested in space and am learning things.'' The flight simulator is named `` 2061 Simulator'' and is designed to give children the impression they are on a mission in that year. <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Joels </PERSON>, director of educational facilities for <ORGANIZATION> Challenger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, said that year is significant because it will mark the 100th anniversary of spaceflight, the 75th anniversary of the Challenger, and the next visit to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>'s solar system of <PERSON> Halley </PERSON>'s Comet Museums in 31 cities and five foreign countries have expressed interest in participating in the program, with <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Alamagordo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>; and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> already taking part in planning sessions, Challenger Center officials said.

 President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> said Thursday that his first meeting ever with <LOCATION> Turkish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cypriot </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Rauf </PERSON> <PERSON> Denktash </PERSON> generated goodwill, `` but there is still a huge gap between our positions.'' `` We did not make an effort to narrow or to widen this gap. What we concetrated on was to get to know each other and agree on the procedure for future intensive negotiations,'' he told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in an interview. `` The fact that we did agree on the procedure so quickly is a good omen.'' Later, an anonymous bomb threat delayed <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON>'s return to <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, but a search of the Olympic Airways <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 proved the call to be a hoax, said the commander of the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> airport security force, Maj. <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Troyon </PERSON> <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> invited <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON> and <PERSON> Denktash </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> in an effort to break the nearly 3-year-old deadlock in negotiations for the reunification of the east Mediterranean island. In <LOCATION> Ankara </LOCATION>, an announcement by the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> expressed <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>'s pleasure that the two <LOCATION> Cypriot </LOCATION> leaders decided to start intercommunal negotiations to seek a settlement. <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> has been unofficially partitioned since a Turkish invasion in 1974 following an Athens-backed coup by supporters of union with <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> chief said Wednesday that after conferring with him, the two men agreed to embark on intensive negotiations in the island's capital, <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, on Sept. 15. They will meet him again in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> about six weeks later to review any progress achieved. <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON> was elected president last February as a non-party independent candidate with support from both the left and right. Four previous top-level meetings since the Turkish invasion, between <PERSON> Denktash </PERSON> and then-President <PERSON> Spyros </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyprianou </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kyprianou </PERSON>'s predecessor, the late Archbishop <PERSON> Makarios </PERSON>, all failed to achieve progress. The two sides have agreed on a settlement based on establishing a bizonal federation to reunify the island and dissolve the breakaway Turkish Cypriot state established in north <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> in Nov. 1983 and recognized only by <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. They disagree over constitutional arrangements and the implementation of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolutions on <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> ignored by <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. These demand withdrawal of the estimated 30,000 Turkish occupation troops and 50,000 settlers from <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> brought to north <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, and the return of 200,000 expelled Greek Cypriot refugees to their homes there. <PERSON> Denktash </PERSON> reiterated in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> his rejection of the troop withdrawal before the dissolution of the internationally recognized <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> government and the establishment of a joint Greek and <LOCATION> Turkish-Cypriot </LOCATION> interim administration. But <PERSON> Denktash </PERSON> indicated there were better prospects of a settlement in talks with <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON>, who has stated repeatedly he wants to settle the problem before the end of his first year in office. `` This is the sort of man I wanted, and I found him. He is the type I can negotiate seriously with,'' <PERSON> Denktash </PERSON> said.

 They boogied and stomped their way into the nation's living rooms in the 1950s when <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bandstand </ORGANIZATION> was filmed in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. Now they're back in the city where it began, rehearsing for a reunion. For the first time in 30 years, 27 of the original Bandstand dancers, including <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON>, <PERSON> Arlene </PERSON>, <PERSON> Carole </PERSON>, <PERSON> Flossie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jim </PERSON>, got together Thursday night to rehearse their steps for a show Sept. 4 at <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION>'s Landing. `` American Bandstand,'' with host <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, made its network debut on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> television Aug. 5, 1957. <PERSON> Bandstander </PERSON> <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Fusco </PERSON> of south <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Lis </PERSON> <PERSON> Braun </PERSON> of the Hot Foot Agency cooked up the idea of bringing the gang together again.

When he's not dancing, <PERSON> Fusco </PERSON> is a professional party organizer. `` You were like a big star. Girls chased ya; the guys hated ya,'' he said. The show was filmed near the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION>, across from the Pop Singers drugstore, where the dancers used to hang out to meet their fans. The drugstore is no longer there, but the steps the dancers invented are still given a whirl: the bunny hop, the chalypso and the stroll. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> emceed the show from its inception in 1952 until <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> took over in 1956. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> moved the show to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> in 1964, but the show's fans still remember it as a <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> phenomenon.

 <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> need not give up financial records of donations for her dying son's liver transplants, a judge ruled Thursday, dismissing contempt motions that could have landed her in jail. Forcing Ms. DeSillers to give the records and items allegedly bought with some of the $ 690,000 in donations to the court-appointed curator of her son <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON>'s estate `` would tend to incriminate her,'' said <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Probate Judge <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>. `` I'm very happy,'' said Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON>, who while awaiting the ruling gave her age as `` 33, the same as <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> when he was crucified.'' During the two-day contempt hearing, her attorney, <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, argued that Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> had a Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination because prosecutors in <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Broward </LOCATION> counties are investigating her for possible criminal violations. Lawyers for curator <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Gievers </PERSON> had no immediate comment on the ruling, but later received an emergency hearing Friday before <PERSON> Christie </PERSON> on their request to seize disputed properties and to strike Ms. DeSillers' $ 150,000 claim on her son's estate, said another of Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON>' lawyers, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> received massive publicity last year after the theft of $ 4,000 that her 7-year-old son's classmates had raised for the boy's liver transplant. Donations poured in, including $ 1,000 from President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and $ 200,000 from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> industrialist <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Posner </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> died in April 1987 while awaiting a fourth transplant at Children's Hospital in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON>' handling of the money came under question when the hospital sued for the $ 262,000 balance of the boy's bill. She refuses to pay, claiming <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> received improper care, a charge the hospital vehemently denies. Shortly before the ruling Thursday, Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON>' former fiance, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON>, was handcuffed and whisked away as he stepped out of the courtroom where he been accompanying Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON>. Metro-Dade Detective <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Garafola </PERSON> said <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> pawned two <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> computers, monitors and printers worth $ 4,000. One of the computer sets had been stolen in March, and the other has not been traced, the detective said. As he was led away, <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> called the charge `` ridiculous.'' His bail was set at $ 1,000 per count on a charge of grand theft and another of dealing in stolen property. Detectives said they could not say if Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> was involved. Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> was `` devastated'' by the arrest, said <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Gievers </PERSON>, a lawyer, was appointed by the court in March to oversee <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON>'s estate after the charges arose that the money might have been misspent by Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Gievers </PERSON> said Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> apparently spent some $ 200,000 of donations improperly, including $ 13,500 for a used BMW and $ 11,000 for jewelry. The curator had sought the records to confirm her findings. <PERSON> Christie </PERSON> froze the estate assets, which are to be used for outstanding bills or to help other needy, sick children. He also repeatedly ordered Ms. DeSillers to give up financial records and to hand over purchases allegedly made with the When she refused, Ms. <PERSON> Gievers </PERSON> sought the contempt of court citations, punishable by fines or jail time. <PERSON> Christie </PERSON> declined to elaborate on his brief order Thursday rejecting that request. <PERSON> Black </PERSON> portrayed his client as an unfairly maligned and generous woman who handled the publicity, money and her only child's death as best she could. He also said that some of the donations were meant for Ms. DeSillers' personal use. `` I'm not saying people gave it for <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> to buy jewelry. -LRB- But -RRB- if she bought a pickup truck for $ 20,000, which is what they cost today, nobody would have criticized her,'' he told the judge. `` You'd think this was ` Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous.' This is not a woman who deserves to be humiliated,'' <PERSON> Black </PERSON> said.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> says the controversy over her husband's service in the National Guard was created by bored, biased journalists who have `` gone too far.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> made her comments in an interview Wednesday with <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> for the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> program `` 20-20,'' set to air Friday night. Asked why she thought people are reacting so strongly to the question of whether <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> pulled strings to enter the National Guard at the height of the Vietnam War, Mrs. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> replied: `` I do n't think people are. I think it's a total creation of the media.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said it had `` crossed her mind'' that journalists are out to get the Republican vice-presidential nominee. `` I ca n't substantiate that,'' she said. `` I think part of it is just the fact that there were so many members of the media down in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> with nothing to do. And they decided they would find a story. And they looked wherever they thought they could and dug something up.'' She said the race is `` extraordinarily important to our country.'' `` And when you deal in rumors and innuendo instead of dealing with the issues that are important to the continuation of the success of our country, not only is that an insult to every voter in this nation, but it's not fair to the voters,'' she said. `` They've -LRB- the media -RRB- gone too far.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said her husband may attract more scrutiny from some members of the media because of his conservative views. `` I just have the feeling that there is in a great deal of the media a bias not only towards Republicans, but especially towards conservative Republicans,'' she said. `` And it's come out many times over, it's something we deal with all the time.''

<HEAD>Suriname, France Sign Agreement to Repatriate 10,000 Refugees</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARAMARIBO, Suriname (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Suriname </LOCATION> signed an accord Thursday paving the way for voluntary repatriation of about 10,000 Surinamese refugees who fled into <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guiana </LOCATION> to escape fighting between rebels and the army. `` This is a significant step to solve this grave human suffering and is cause to be hopeful,'' said <PERSON> Gaston </PERSON> <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Paudert </PERSON>, the French charge d'affaires in <LOCATION> Paramaribo </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> has pledged to help pay the cost of repatriation. The agreement did not specify how or when the refugees will be repatriated. It said, however, that as a first step the refugees will receive special identification cards. Also signing the pact were the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> High Commissioner for Refugees, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon-Lennox </PERSON>, who drafted the text, and <LOCATION> Suriname </LOCATION>'s foreign affairs minister, <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Sedoc </PERSON>. `` For the voluntary return of the refugees it is necessary that peace return in the eastern part of <LOCATION> Suriname </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Paudert </PERSON> said. Rebel leader <PERSON> Ronny </PERSON> <PERSON> Brunswijk </PERSON> has led a guerrilla war since 1986 against the army in <LOCATION> Suriname </LOCATION>, a former Dutch colony in northeast <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Brunswijk </PERSON> refused to stop the insurgency in the tiny country despite the election last November of civilian President <PERSON> Ramsewak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shankar </PERSON>, who replaced junta leader and present army commander <PERSON> Desi </PERSON> <PERSON> Bouterse </PERSON>. Under the accord, the refugees must return voluntarily and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, which now pays about $ 1.5 million a month to house and feed them, can not evict the refugees from <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guiana </LOCATION>. The refugees have said they will not go home until they have guarantees the fighting will stop. Meanwhile, 14 barefoot gold miners in a dug-out canoe arrived Thursday in a small village in <LOCATION> Brokopondo </LOCATION> province in central <LOCATION> Suriname </LOCATION>, and said nine rebels with machine guns had attacked their isolated camp two days earlier. They said the guerrillas beat them and stole all their valuables. The miners said the rebels took the small amount of gold they had, loading it onto two boats owned by the mine, and made off with their shoes, a refrigerator, cooking utensils and shotguns. The 14 men reached the village after paddling two days down <LOCATION> Sarakreek </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in a large canoe given to them by the rebels, who told them their mining camp was operated by <PERSON> Bouterse </PERSON> and ordered them to abandon it.

<HEAD>Bush: Deployment Decision Depends on More Research</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A decision on whether to deploy a full or partial Star Wars defense system must await more research into its capabilities and costs, Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in a published interview. `` We do n't know yet, which system is going to be the most effective, so my view is full funding of the research and then make the deployment decision when you have all the cards on the table,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in an interview published in Friday's editions of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. The vice president, in an apparent softening of earlier promises to deploy the Strategic Defense Initiative `` as soon as feasible,'' indicated that cost would be a factor in determining whether to deploy it. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has advanced SDI _ an anti-missile system using new, space-based technologies _ as a shield against nuclear missiles which could make those weapons obsolete. `` I do n't think we yet know what the price tag will be,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` If you went to a full deployment of a full strategic defense, it would be very expensive. What I want to do is to continue reserach at the levels of funding, essentially, that we have requested.'' The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has asked for more than $ 4 billion for SDI research this year. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also said that he recently has become interested in the concept of a limited system _ `` not a full shield, but a partial deployment.'' `` If I can get convinced by the experts that that would be a guardian, a safeguard against a weapon accidentally fired, or weapons in the hands of some terrorist state, then I'd be interested in this partial deployment,'' he said. `` At this juncture I am not prepared to endorse it, but I'm not prepared to totally reject it,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> added. The Times said the interview was conducted as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> after a rally in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> on Wednesday. In <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s speech accepting the Republican nomination for president last week, he said he would `` continue our policy of peace through strength,'' and added: `` I will modernize and preserve our technological edge and that includes strategic defense.'' A passage in the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> platform reads, `` We are committed to rapid and certain deployment of SDI as technologies permit ...''

<HEAD>Kennebunkport Residents Wary of Bush Presidency Impact</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KENNEBUNKPORT, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In this staunchly Republican town that Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> calls his summer home, bumper stickers are urging residents to `` Save <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, Vote Democratic'88.'' While <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is enjoying a surge in popularity in post-GOP convention polls, the stickers appearing on dozens of cars and trucks in this coastal resort community reflect the oft-heard grumbling that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s presidential candidacy is ruining the tourist trade _ and the town. `` A <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> presidency would make this place so busy it would be unbearable,'' says resident <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Wentworth </PERSON>. `` Already it's full of people streaming in to see his house.'' <PERSON> Wentworth </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, has printed and sold more than 750 of the anti-Bush bumper stickers in the past couple of months. He says they are intended to help save <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION> from the tourist traffic chaos threatened by a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> presidency as much as they are meant to be a political statement. When <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> effectively clinched the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination with primary victories last March, the 2,900 year-round residents looked forward to a busy summer tourist season because of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s occasional presence here. The crowds, indeed, are big. But they do n't stay, and they hardly spend any money. Instead, many of the tourists visit for only an hour or two, driving past the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> estate on picturesque <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>'s Point, stopping to snap a photo and then motoring back to Interstate 95. `` A lot of people come up to see where he lives,'' says <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Drake </PERSON>, owner of a downtown gift shop. `` They do n't come to shop.'' Nearly every hotel, inn and guesthouse in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION> has vacancies. Stores report declining sales, and many businesses say fewer tourist dollars are being spent than in any year in recent memory. Ask how business has been this summer, and the usual response is, `` Do n't ask,'' or `` It's so, so slow.'' Hopes for a profitable season have been cast aside like undersized lobsters, which are this town's other big money-maker. `` It's been really, really slow compared to the last couple of years,'' said <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> as she surveyed the empty <ORGANIZATION> Strudel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shop </ORGANIZATION> restaurant. `` When he -LRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> -RRB- is in town, for a couple days it's real busy, but then it slows down,'' she said. <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Treadwell </PERSON>, who works at the <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Whale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Watch </ORGANIZATION>, a tour boat company less than two miles from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s home, says there've been only two sold-out cruises so far this summer, even with excellent weather and numerous whale sightings Last year at this time, the figure was 20. At <PERSON> Mabel </PERSON>'s Lobster Claw Restaurant, where <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> frequently dines when he is visiting, <PERSON> Mabel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> bemoans the slow season but is reluctant to blame the vice president. `` I do n't think it has anything to do with Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, but we're having a terrible summer,'' she says Why? `` Everybody's got their own opinion,'' says <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Savell </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Kennebunk-Kennebunkport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>. Some say it's a sign of bad economic times. Others say it's been too hot, too cold, too rainy. But privately, many locals complain that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s presence has scared away tourists who fear nightmarish crowds and traffic jams. `` People are afraid to come up, but it's not like that at all. It's just dead,'' said <PERSON> Gerda </PERSON> <PERSON> Towne </PERSON>, owner of two downtown stores. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s seaside compound, situated at the end of a rocky peninsula in southern <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, has become the major tourist attraction in town. Traffic is nearly always heavy near his home. Motorists park next to no-parking signs lining the twisting, two-lane road, and clamber onto the shore to take pictures. <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION> Police Lt. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> confirms that traffic has been heavier around the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> estate this summer, but he says traffic became a serious problem about a decade ago. He would n't blame <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for that <PERSON> Wentworth </PERSON> says many Republicans have bought his anti-Bush bumper stickers to show their concern for the future of <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION> in the event of a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> presidency. `` The town was never meant to handle the kind of traffic that's already coming in,'' <PERSON> Wentworth </PERSON> said, `` I feel that much of that is due to him, and he's not even president yet.

<HEAD>ABC Documentary Examines Crisis in Foster Care</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON>, a teen-ager who feels unloved and unwanted after growing up in a series of foster homes, sums up the circular problem of foster care more succinctly than an army of experts: `` I would tell the people that want to put their kids in foster care that they should n't do it, because they should n't have brung their kids into the world if they ca n't take care of'em.'' As described in <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s documentary `` Crimes Against Children: Failure of Foster Care,'' airing Tuesday, an overburdened bureaucracy is forced to make extremely delicate choices: try to keep the family together and risk further neglect, abuse, even the ultimate horror of a child's death? Or break up the family and consign the child to a life of shuffling among foster homes, where abuse is not unknown? <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> previously examined the issue of foster care in 1979's `` Nobody's Children. Since then, reports of child abuse have skyrocketed, and there are more unwed mothers and poverty-stricken families putting even more pressure on the system. The documentary uses praiseworthy restraint; the stories of abused children, wrecked families and frustrated social workers need no embellishment. The reporter is <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> <PERSON> Chase </PERSON>. <PERSON> Av </PERSON> <PERSON> Westin </PERSON> is executive producer, <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> senior producer. Take the story of <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON>, a neglected <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> infant who was placed in a loving foster home but returned to his mother and her new husband _ an alcoholic with a history of child abuse _ after they underwent counseling. Not long afterwards, before a social worker could get the obviously battered 2-year-old out of the home, he was admitted to the hospital in a coma. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON>'s former foster mother, <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkens </PERSON>, recalled visiting him at the hospital in hopes he could hear her. `` We told him that we loved him, and that he had n't done anything wrong, and that we were very sorry, we thought his new parents were going to be able to love him too, and that <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> would be waiting to meet him.'' <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> never came out of the coma. On the other side are families torn asunder by hard times and put back together only after years of struggling through red tape. Bright, articulate 12-year-old <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON> was not abused. His mother voluntarily gave up her children when she was hospitalized and could n't care for them. `` My worst fear is never seeing my mother again,'' <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON> says. `` The foster care people are trying to tell my mother that she's not good enough right now She's good enough for me anytime.'' It took five years for <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON>'s mother to get her children back. <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON>, accompanied by his mother, testified before a congressional committee investigating foster care. Some foster parents seriously abuse the children they are supposed to care for. One <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> child was tortured to death by her foster parents after her case was lost in a bureaucratic maze and the couple moved her illegally to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. There are also stories of social workers strapped by lack of resources. <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillard </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> must enter dangerous neighborhoods trying to track down many of the dozens of families she oversees, 90 percent of whom do not have telephones. She complains that her agency gets attention only when one of its failures makes the news. The documentary concludes with more uplifting stories, most of them based on successful local programs _ educating foster parents, keeping families together in times of trouble and helping grown foster children adjust to life on their own. Most documentaries on social problems end with calls for more money. And obviously, money for more workers to ease caseloads would help enormously. But this is one problem that only human caring will eventually solve. As <PERSON> Chase </PERSON> concludes, `` The need for community involvement has never been greater. The system desperately needs more foster parents, adoptive parents, court advocates and just friends. How else are we going to put real caring into foster care?''

 Elsewhere in television: ` EXILES' IN PRODUCTION _ Academy Award-winning filmmaker <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaplan </PERSON> is making a two-hour documentary for PBS this season. `` The Exiles'' will tell the story of European artists, scholars and intellectuals who emigrated to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> shortly before the outbreak of World War II to escape fascism. <PERSON> Kaplan </PERSON> says the stories told by the immigrants were so compelling, he lets them tell their tales and dropped the narration. <PERSON> Kaplan </PERSON> won an Oscar for best feature documentary for `` The Eleanor Roosevelt Story.'' `` The Exiles'' will air sometime in the spring of 1989.

 Bankruptcy court officials predict the drought will force hundreds of Midwestern farmers who might otherwise have survived financially to abandon their fields after the coming harvest. After a sharp drop in bankruptcy cases in the first half of 1988, courts throughout the Farm Belt expect a surge in bankruptcy petition filings in the next six months, even with help from the huge federal drought assistance bill, according to officials in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. `` The figures looked so promising, but with what's happened this summer we're not going to bump along with this low figure,'' said <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Manley </PERSON>, chief clerk of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Duff </PERSON>, an assistant to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>'s assistant secretary for economics, said farm bankruptcies linked to the drought would increase nationwide later this year, stunting an economic upturn in the farm economy that began in late 1987. `` Last year debts were actually less than receipts and land values stabilized. But historically, anytime you have a drought the numbers go up and down,'' <PERSON> Duff </PERSON> said. `` There were probably a number of farmers on the line, having a make-or-break-you year and they probably will go bankrupt or quit. `` We do n't have any way of knowing how many, but it will be a national kind of problem,'' <PERSON> Duff </PERSON> said. The Madison court, which handles bankruptcy petitions involving individuals, businesses and farms for 44 of <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> 72 counties, received 154 petitions from farmers the first seven months of the year. That compared with 293 for the same period last year. Since 1985, farm bankruptcies have made up 13 percent to 16 percent of total cases in the <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION> district. There were 420 in 1985, 511 in 1986 and 448 last year. `` I'll predict filings will more than double by the end of the year,'' Ms. <PERSON> Manley </PERSON> said. `` We'll be around 400 again.'' <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Everly </PERSON>, chief clerk of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy court in <LOCATION> Cedar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rapids </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, said she expected a 20 percent increase in bankruptcies this winter. `` You're not only talking about farms, but it may be the final blow for implement dealers and service stations and the convenience stores in those small farm communities that have been on the edge,'' said <PERSON> Everly </PERSON>. As in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Everly </PERSON> said farm bankruptcies in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> so far this year have fallen well below previous levels. She said climbing land values in the state and an improving farm economy had eased financial woes. But now, with crops stunted or wiped out and many farmers still owing the costs of seed and fertilizer, `` I expect that lenders are getting terribly, terribly jumpy,'' she said. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> agriculture economist, called the drought `` a major setback'' to an agriculture economy that began improving late last year. `` A lot of them are just going to have to call it quits,'' <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, farm bankruptcies were down by almost 78 percent the first seven months of the year. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Naylor </PERSON>, deputy clerk for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.D. </LOCATION>, said 61 farm petitions had been filed through July, compared to 311 for the same period a year ago. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> was among the early states hardest hit by the drought. However, Judge <PERSON> Irvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyt </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON>, <LOCATION> S.D. </LOCATION>, said the number of farm bankruptcies would depend on the eligibility and timing of federal drought aid to farmers. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> signed the $ 3.9 billion drought assistance bill Aug. 11, and the government hopes to begin taking applications by Oct. 1. Under the law, aid to farmers who lose more than 35 percent of their expected harvest will cover 65 percent of that lost income. For farmers who suffer crop losses of more than 75 percent, the aid would equal 90 percent of the lost income. `` Until we know exactly ... when -LRB- aid -RRB- will be available, particularly for those in bankruptcy who must modify their plans, we wo n't know what's going to happen with filings,'' <PERSON> Hoyt </PERSON> said. Farmers generally file Chapter 11 petitions, which grant protection from creditors and create a plan for debt payment, or Chapter 12 petitions, which were created in 1986 in the Family Farm Act. Chapter 12 petitions generally resemble Chapter 11 petitions, but proponents say they give the debtor stronger control over the payment schedule and use a trustee, generally an attorney, to administer it. Chapter 11 and 12 debt payment plans can be modified to fit unexpected economic troubles and even allow payments to be temporarily suspended. But the huge financial losses anticipated in the drought may require payments to be reduced or suspended for so long that creditors might urge liquidation, said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Bromley </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Lancaster </LOCATION> attorney who handles farm bankruptcies. Creditors `` would have a strong argument that the -LRB- normal bankruptcy -RRB- plan simply wo n't work,'' <PERSON> Bromley </PERSON> said. `` My greatest concern would be for the people already in bankruptcy. In some cases, payment plans may have to be modified to drastically reduce or suspend payments for a year,'' <PERSON> Bromley </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bromley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hoyt </PERSON> also said that next spring's operational costs for feed, fertilizer and other items may be too high for some under present plans and reduced income. `` Buying at higher costs will throw those plans and cash flows back into court for modifications,'' <PERSON> Bromley </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bromley </PERSON> said he's had relatively few consultations with farmers about financial problems this summer. `` I think the reason is it's so hard out there, so beyond the experience of most farmers, that they want to wait and see where things fall,'' he said.

<HEAD>USDA Researcher Says Rural Population Decline May Be Easing _
Again</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Census figures show that living in rural <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> away from city clamor is not quite as attractive as it once was, but <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> experts say the countryside could beckon again when times improve. During the 1970s it seemed to many demographers, including <PERSON> Calvin </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Beale </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, that rural living was on a roll, that people flocking from the cities were turning the tide of decades of migration from farms and small towns. But the human tide weakened in the early 1980s as the economy faltered, farmland values plummeted and rural employment suffered. Quickly, says <PERSON> Beale </PERSON>, the `` exceptional rural and small-town growth of the previous decade ended.'' A study of `` metro'' and `` non-metro'' counties shows that during the years of the population turnaround, Americans once again began heading for the cities. The federal government says a metro area is one having a city of at least 50,000 as a nucleus and adjacent communities that have a high degree of economic and social integration with that city. <PERSON> Beale </PERSON> said that in the 1980-83 period, the non-metro population increased at the rate of 0.83 percent a year, which once again trailed the metro gain of 1.1 percent annually. Moreover, there were 720 non-metro counties with population declines, half again as many as in the low levels of the 1970s. Even so, the rural population balance looked pretty good by comparison with the 1950s and 1960s, when huge waves of people moved from farms and small towns to the cities. And then the situation worsened. From 1983 to 1986, despite a recovery in the national economy, the ability of rural areas to attract or retain people rapidly deteriorated, <PERSON> Beale </PERSON> said. The annual non-metro population increase dropped to 0.42 percent per year, only half as high as the 1980-83 rate, while the annual metro population increase rose slightly to 1.12 percent. It is this science of numbers, decimals and fractions that makes the lives of demographers exciting. And shifts in where people live can translate into huge meanings for the nation as a whole as economies of small towns, counties and cities gain or lose. <PERSON> Beale </PERSON>'s analysis is in the current issue of RDP, or Rural Development Perspectives, a periodical issued three times a year by the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. In his assessment, <PERSON> Beale </PERSON> said that the very low growth of non-metro population in the 1983-86 period was `` the most striking feature of post-1980 trends.'' During that time, 1,306 counties, or 55 percent of all non-metro counties in the country, lost residents between 1983 and 1986. `` The average loss per county was not large, but the incidence of loss was as widespread as when farm consolidation was at its peak in the 1960s, when 53 percent of the non-metro counties lost population, and in the 1950s, 54 percent,'' <PERSON> Beale </PERSON> said. But there are bright spots, too. Counties known as retirement havens continue to attract new residents, not just older people but younger workers who provide services and goods to the retired population. These counties grew annually by more than 1.78 percent from 1980 to 1986, more than double the national rate, <PERSON> Beale </PERSON> said. Also, non-metro counties with a fourth or more of their residents commuting to jobs in metro areas grew by 1.13 percent a year, a bit faster than the national growth rate, although a sharp decline from their 1.92 percent gains in the 1970s. `` After mid-1983, non-metro counties with any growth at all were a rarity throughout the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, Corn Belt and central and northern <LOCATION> Appalachia </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Beale </PERSON> said. `` In <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, the quintessential farm state, 84 of 88 non-metro counties lost population from 1983 to 1986, as outmovement more than offset any excess of births over debts.'' <PERSON> Beale </PERSON> said lower birth rates also help prompt the population decline in rural areas. During the 1950s and 1960s, the non-metro birth rate was considerably higher than the more recent rate. In the 1960s, it averaged more than 20 births per 1,000 people, with the death rate at less than 10 per 1,000. In 1980-86, the rural birth rate was 15.6 per 1,000 people, a decline of about a fourth from the 1960s, while the death rate was about the same at 9.6 per 1,000. But <PERSON> Beale </PERSON> said `` the worst may be over'' for non-metro areas in terms of economically related population declines. Farm income, supported heavily by federal subsidies, was at an all-time high in 1987, debts have declined somewhat, exports have improved, commodity surpluses have declined and 1988 cash income is expected to be second only to last year's. `` These positive factors do not presage an increase in the farm population, for there is no need for additional farmers,'' he said. `` But if the improved conditions are sustained, they should lead to resumed local investment and spending, and greater retention of population in farm counties.''

 The unassuming green building in this city's produce district looks like a warehouse and, like a warehouse, it's filled with row after row of boxes and cans of food. But <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Garvey </PERSON> sees it differently. `` This is a laboratory,'' she says. `` We're creating a new industry.'' <PERSON> Garvey </PERSON>, 31, is president of <ORGANIZATION> Grocery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>, a company that delivers just about anything you can find on a supermarket shelf to people who ca n't or do n't want to shop and who are glad to pay a little extra for convenience. `` People have less and less time. And that trend is not reversing,'' <PERSON> Garvey </PERSON> said in a recent interview. About 5,000 people in the city and the northern <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> save time by ordering groceries from <PERSON> Garvey </PERSON>'s 7-year-old company and having them delivered for a flat fee of $ 4.25. Prices are about 15 percent higher than at large supermarkets and about the same as at a corner grocery, <PERSON> Garvey </PERSON> said. Forty percent of her patrons are businesses, elderly and homebound people, but the rest are two-income couples, professional singles or families with young children. `` These are people who have no time but lots of demands on their time,'' she said. <PERSON> Katherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Craven </PERSON>, a writer and homemaker, first called Grocery Express 6 -LCB- years ago when she was pregnant and did n't want to climb stairs to her second-floor Victorian flat with bags of groceries. `` For me it's been a great thing, and particularly in the winter or if someone is sick, it's just a godsend,'' said <PERSON> Craven </PERSON>. Customers order from among several hundred items in Grocery Express' catalog, a 128-page guide that includes fresh flowers, restaurant meals and food gift baskets as well as fresh meat and produce and canned and packaged goods. Each item has a number, which <ORGANIZATION> Grocery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>' clerks punch into a computer, noting whether customers want their chicken boned or bananas barely ripe. Customers also can file orders through their home computers. Orders are put together in the company's 18,000-square-foot warehouse and delivered in one of seven vans. <PERSON> Garvey </PERSON>, who has an economics degree from <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, learned about business from her family's company, <ORGANIZATION> Garvey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION>, Kan.-based concern dealing in oil and gas, grain and real estate. Grocery delivery, while not a new idea, has not been a very profitable one. Over the past 15 years, other entrepreneurs have started companies like <ORGANIZATION> Grocery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> but failed, <PERSON> Garvey </PERSON> said. Grocery Express nearly became one of those failures after an enthusiastic beginning. <PERSON> Garvey </PERSON> was an original investor, but it was her former husband, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Meagher </PERSON>, and friend <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Coghlan </PERSON> who were the real founders, she said. <PERSON> Garvey </PERSON> became more involved in the business and took it over two years later. In 1984, the company's sales had leveled off at about $ 2 million, but the firm had yet to turn a profit. Grocery Express raised its prices, but lost customers and even more money. The next year, it came close to shutting down. But <PERSON> Garvey </PERSON>, who describes herself as eternally optimistic, was sure she could turn the company around. `` I was just certain this is a business people need,'' she said. `` I looked at it from a different point of view _ long term _ and was willing to spend the additional time and money.'' Since 1985, <PERSON> Garvey </PERSON> has put between $ 1.5 million and $ 2 million into the firm, reduced prices and used direct mail and radio ads to regain former customers and win new ones. In 1986, sales rose to $ 2.3 million with a loss of $ 330,000, and last year, sales increased to $ 2.7 million while the company's loss shrank to $ 75,000. <PERSON> Garvey </PERSON> expects to turn a profit this year. She's also planning to expand her delivery area and is considering opening another warehouse. Of her company's future, she said, `` It's going to be interesting to see.''

 A small <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> company and the local arm of international pharmaceutical giant F. <PERSON> Hoffmann-La </PERSON> <PERSON> Roche </PERSON> hope to profit from the fight against drug abuse, through their disposable drug testing kits. The kits are aimed at law enforcement agencies and businesses that engaged in on-the-spot drug testing, but can be hampered by the time consuming process of having to send samples off to a lab for analysis. <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Screening </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> Blackwood </LOCATION>, is marketing a system called InstaScreen that it says is as easy to use a brewing a cup of coffee _ which is where the idea originated. `` While making a cup of coffee in a Mr. Coffee machine, we said, ` Hey, why not do something like this?' And that was it,'' said <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Akers </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a founder of Drug Screening Systems. `` Quite honestly, it was one of those, ` ah hah!' things,'' he said in an interview. To use the company's device, a urine sample is poured through a disk-shaped filter that collects detectable amounts concentration of any illegal narcotics. The filter is chemically treated to hold any drug traces, and turns the color red if drugs are present. Drug Screening's device likely will face competition from the number of similar tests being created by other companies. One such competitor is <ORGANIZATION> Hoffmann-La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Nutley </LOCATION>, an unit of the Swiss pharmaceutical giant <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hoffmann-La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. <PERSON> Hoffmann-La </PERSON> <PERSON> Roche </PERSON> plans to put its <ORGANIZATION> Ontrak </ORGANIZATION> system on the market in October, said <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Seidner </PERSON>, director of drug abuse marketing for <PERSON> Hoffmann-La </PERSON> <PERSON> Roche </PERSON> subsidiary <ORGANIZATION> Roche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diagnostic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ontrak </ORGANIZATION> costs about $ 2 per test for a specific drug. Urine is placed on a channeled slide and a chemical is added to detect drug traces. The tests come in packages of 40 or 100 and are being tried by criminal justice agencies, said <PERSON> Seidner </PERSON>. Patents have been issued for the <PERSON> Hoffmann-La </PERSON> <PERSON> Roche </PERSON> product, he said. They have been approved for InstaScreen, said <PERSON> Akers </PERSON>' patent lawyer, <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Spivak </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, but not yet issued. InstaScreen kits, which cost about $ 5, contain gloves, two collection cups, strainer, chemical disk and vials. It also includes a bottle for sending positive samples to a lab for confirmation. On-site tests reduce the chance of a mix-up because the samples do not have to be sent to a lab. Also, the tester does not have to wait the usual days or weeks for the sample to be returned. InstaScreen and <ORGANIZATION> Ontrak </ORGANIZATION> also are immune to befuddlement by vinegar or salt, condiments commonly used to mask the presence of drugs. Salt flicked from under a fingernail or vinegar added from a hidden vial prevents most immunoassay tests from working, <PERSON> Akers </PERSON> said. In such tests, antibodies bind with the drug chemicals to register a positive result, but salt and vinegar interfere with the reaction. However, InstaScreen uses chemicals and not antibodies to identify a drug presence, <PERSON> Akers </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hoffmann-La </PERSON> <PERSON> Roche </PERSON>'s test, although it is an immunoassay, is a type that is not defeated by salt or vinegar, said <PERSON> Seidner </PERSON>. <PERSON> Akers </PERSON> founded Drug Screening with his father <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Akers </PERSON> Sr. in March 1987. The company went public in May with a $ 3 million stock offering. Drug Screening will report its first fiscal year earnings in several weeks, and expects a profit on a projected $ 3 million in sales, said <PERSON> Akers </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Sales Slip In Mid-August, But Incentives of Last Year Skew Numbers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Sales of domestically-produced cars slipped 18.5 percent in mid-August compared with the same period last year, but analysts said buyer incentives a year ago colored the latest figures. U.S.-made truck sales fell 1.8 percent during the Aug. 11-20 period, making for a 13.2 percent overall decline in sales of vehicles from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factories, automakers reported Wednesday. The companies reported selling 298,580 cars and trucks during the period this year, compared with 343,845 vehicles during the same time last year. There were nine selling days in both periods. `` Incentives were just coming in last year and there are no new incentive programs right now,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Healy </PERSON>, an auto industry analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Healy </PERSON> said the numbers were misleading because of the incentives, and that `` They -LRB- sales -RRB- are very strong.'' <PERSON> Arvid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jouppi </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, disagreed with the strength of the sales. `` The simple story is it's going to take incentives and an early influx of 1989 models to get the sales moving up again,'' he said. Car makers have scheduled their 1989-model introductions through the coming month. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> unveiled its 1989 lineup on Wednesday. `` I would say that there is every indication that the industry has to do one of two things _ get into a very intense share-of-market war or they have got to simply come up with innovative new incentives,'' <PERSON> Jouppi </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> showed the largest decline in the 10-day sales, a 30.3 percent decline to 88,394 cars from 126,887 during the period last year. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s sales fell 10 percent, to 60,184 cars from 66,907 cars last year, and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> sales fell 0.8 percent to 25,985 this month from 26,200 during the period last August.

During the Aug. 11-20 period, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s market share fell to 46.4 percent from 54.3 percent during mid-August of last year. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s market share rose to 31.6 percent from 28.6 percent and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s share moved up to 13.6 percent from 11.2 <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said it sold 9,259 cars during mid-August of this year compared with 7,563 cars in the same period last year _ a 22.4 percent increase. <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION>'s sales fell 4.5 percent during the period from 4,380 cars in mid-August 1987 to 4,182 in the same period this year <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sales </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> reported sales of 1,429 cars during the period this year compared with 1,188 last year, an increase of 20.3 percent.

 <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s 1989 model Thunderbirds and Cougars could help the nation's No. 2 automaker cut further into sales of industry leader <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, according to one analyst. `` Ford has been on a hot streak recently and I would n't be surprised if the new Thunderbird and <PERSON> Cougar </PERSON> allows them to eat some more of <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION>'s lunch as far as market share is concerned,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Healy </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday unveiled the redesigned Thunderbird and Cougar and said it hopes to sell about 1.6 million cars and 1.6 million trucks in 1989, a 6.7 percent increase over this year's projected 3 million total sales Overall, the industry is forecasting a drop from expected sales of 10.4 million cars this year. At a news conference held to coincide with an auto dealer convention in neighboring <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> executives said the company is targeting sales of about 130,000 each for the new Mercury Cougar and Ford Thunderbird, which underwent broad design changes in a five-year, multimillion-dollar development effort. Ten-day <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> automotive sales figures released Wednesday gave <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> a 31 percent market share compared with 28 percent last year at this time, while <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> slipped from 54 percent to 45 percent. `` <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s share has been slipping and I would n't be surprised if these new models keep that trend going,'' <PERSON> Healy </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> executives said the company will increase production capacity at some plants to meet higher demand for 1989. The sales targets for the new Thunderbird and Cougar mark a 30 percent increase over this year. The company said both cars would be priced under $ 20,000. `` We're convinced at <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> that the economy is going to remain as good as it is today,'' said <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, general manager of <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln-Mercury </ORGANIZATION> Division. `` We see nothing on the horizon, none of those black clouds you frequently hear about, that says business is going to be bad.'' The new Cougar is two inches shorter than current models, the wheelbase is nine inches longer and the car sits lower to the ground. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said the 113-inch wheelbase adds 10 cubic feet to the passenger compartment. It has just six carryover parts from this year, including the name and crest. The 1989 model Thunderbird, which led <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s move to aerodynamic styling five years ago, has a nine-inch longer wheelbase than this year's model, low profile headlamps, and larger wheels and brakes. Some of the new Cougars and Thunderbirds will be equipped with a standard 3.8-liter V-6 engine. `` These vehicles are going to come on strong with higher performance engines,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Grady </PERSON> of Integrated Automotive Resources, a market researcher in <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> earned $ 1.66 billion in the second quarter of 1988, setting an industry earnings record for the second straight three-month period In the first quarter, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> earned $ 1.623 billion. Aside from the Cougar and Thunderbird, other new <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> lines showed few if any changes for 1989, the 50th anniversary of the Mercury name. Production of Thunderbird and Cougar is to begin in October. The cars will be on introduced to the public Dec. 26 _ both late starts for a new model year, which officially begins Oct. 1. <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln-Mercury </ORGANIZATION> is targeting total sales of 717,000 cars next year, a 7 percent market share of a projected 10.25 million car sales. That would be an increase of 0.3 percentage points over this year and give the division its best year since 1978.

<TEXT>
 R.P. <ORGANIZATION> Scherer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s management said it plans to seek a review of the election of two directors who represent a group that favors selling the pharmaceutical capsule maker. Dissident shareholders led by the company founder's daughter, <PERSON> Karla </PERSON> <PERSON> Scherer </PERSON> <PERSON> Fink </PERSON>, elected the new directors to the 11-member <PERSON> Scherer </PERSON> board, according to proxy voting results announced Wednesday. The vote, which took place at the company's Aug. 17 annual meeting, left directors who back management and oppose selling <PERSON> Scherer </PERSON> with a 6-5 edge on the board, compared with 8-5 before the vote, the dissidents said. Scherer Chief Executive Officer <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Fink </PERSON>, <PERSON> Karla </PERSON> <PERSON> Fink </PERSON>'s estranged husband, said acknowledged the election of dissident candidate <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> to the board, but said the results of close voting in the seat apparently won by dissident <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Souris </PERSON>, who unseated incumbent <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Dow </PERSON>, would be reviewed <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> won 3,019,449 votes to <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION>'s 2,670,876. <PERSON> Karla </PERSON> <PERSON> Fink </PERSON> and her shareholders' committee disputed the need for a review, spokeswoman <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON> said. `` The election is final and official,'' she said. `` That is the certified count from the inspectors.'' But <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Fink </PERSON> said the company would insist on a complete review of proxy cards voted for <LOCATION> Souris </LOCATION> and Dow. In a statement to employees following the meeting, he said, `` Perhaps the most important fact for you to remember is that regardless of the outcome of the election, we have received no offers to buy the company.'' `` Furthermore, even if Mrs. <PERSON> Fink </PERSON>'s nominees for directors are both seated, she would still not have enough support on the board of directors to gain approval for her proposed sale of the company,'' <PERSON> Fink </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Karla </PERSON> <PERSON> Fink </PERSON> has said she would try to convince additional directors of the wisdom of putting the company up for sale, and launch another proxy fight at next year's annual meeting to try to elect additional directors backing her position. Scherer Chairman <PERSON> Wilber </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> adjourned the meeting until 10 a.m. Sept. 1, saying results of the review would be announced then. <PERSON> Karla </PERSON> <PERSON> Fink </PERSON> and board member <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Scherer </PERSON>, the son of company founder <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Scherer </PERSON>, disputed <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>'s authority to adjourn and stated they were accepting the voting results as announced. <PERSON> Scherer </PERSON>, with 2,800 employees, is a leading maker of soft gelatin capsules for drugs, vitamin supplements and similar products. It had record sales of $ 290.7 million and earnings of $ 15.1 million for its fiscal year ending March 31.

<HEAD>French Industrialist Tapie Candidate For Donnay Rescue</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 French industrialist <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Tapie </PERSON> wants to take over <ORGANIZATION> Donnay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION>, the Belgian tennis racket maker that went bankrupt last week, officials said Thursday. `` <PERSON> Tapie </PERSON> is welcome but if another serious candidate presents a more credible, more interesting offer, he will have priority,'' said <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON>, a union spokesman. The daily <ORGANIZATION> Le </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soir </ORGANIZATION> reported <PERSON> Tapie </PERSON>, 43, has already reached a `` tentative'' takeover accord under which 150 of the 350 jobs would be saved. In recent years, <PERSON> Tapie </PERSON> has bought a range of failing firms and made them profitable, becoming something of a symbol of French entrepreneurial spirit. <PERSON> Donnay </PERSON>, the world's number one racket maker a decade ago, was declared bankrupt last Friday by a Belgian court after failing to reach agreement with creditors on new funds and a restructuring of its debt. Hours later, Damaco International of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, became the first takeover candidate. <PERSON> Donnay </PERSON>, based in <LOCATION> Couvin </LOCATION> near the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> border, is majority-owned by the <PERSON> Donnay </PERSON> family. It reached its peak when <PERSON> Bjorn </PERSON> <PERSON> Borg </PERSON> advertised its rackets but began to lose money after the Swedish tennis ace retired in 1981. <PERSON> Donnay </PERSON> has debts of 1.4 billion <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> francs -LRB- $ 35 million -RRB-. In 1987, its revenue was 1.16 billion francs -LRB- $ 29 million -RRB-, down a third from 1986, and posted a loss of 80 million francs -LRB- $ 2 million -RRB-. Early in the decade, <PERSON> Donnay </PERSON> made over 1.5 million rackets a year and had a staff of 600. After <PERSON> Borg </PERSON> retired, its output of tennis rackets fell by 50 percent and its staff was cut to 350. Officials said this was because <PERSON> Donnay </PERSON> ignored the trend for rackets made of synthetic products and failed to sign a new tennis star to advertise its product.

<HEAD>Farmers Insurance Group Agrees to $5.2 billion Buyout by Batus
Inc.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GARTIES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to a $ 5.2 billion cash acquisition by <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, ending an acrimonious eight-month takeover battle. The agreement at a price $ 3 per share higher than <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION>' last publicly announced bid was revealed Wednesday night by the chairmen of Los Angeles-based Farmers and <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, Ky.-based, tobacco and retailing company. The agreement for a friendly merger at $ 75 a share would give <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION>' British parent, <ORGANIZATION> B.A.T </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, a foothold in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> financial services industry. The two sides began discussing a friendly buyout late last week when <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION> offered $ 72 per share, an increase of $ 9 per share over its previous best offer. Stock of Farmers, the seventh-largest property and casualty insurer, dipped 50 cents to $ 69.25 a share in active over-the-counter trading Wednesday. The agreement was announced hours after the market closed. `` In reaching its unanimous decision, Farmers' board of directors considered the concerns regarding this combination which have been raised during regulatory hearings, and has been satisfied that these concerns will be adequately addressed in the merger of the two companies,'' said <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Denlea </PERSON>, Jr. chairman and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` We firmly believe that Farmers and <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION> can work with the insurance regulators to give the assurances necessary to enable this merger to be accomplished to the benefit of all parties,'' <PERSON> Denlea </PERSON> added. Farmers' resistance to <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION> included suggestions that the company had suppressed research pointing to the dangers of smoking. Farmers also persuaded a number of state and national lawmakers to attack the British parent firm because it has operations in racially segregated <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. But the merger talks, which began last Wednesday, were strictly business, said <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheehy </PERSON>, chairman of both B.A.T and <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think often things that are said in court are much more acrimonious than one's true feelings,'' <PERSON> Sheehy </PERSON> said in an interview. `` When it came to sitting down and talking, we both decided we were going to do it in a spirit of trust and good will.'' <PERSON> Sheehy </PERSON> said Farmers was pursued because it was found to be the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> insurer most like <ORGANIZATION> B.A.T </ORGANIZATION>'s British insurance business. Attractions included similar lines of insurance and a company-operated network of 14,000 agents. <PERSON> Sheehy </PERSON> said negotiations were complicated by Farmers' structure. The Farmers group is made up of three policyholder-owned insurance exchanges and a company-owned life insurance business. Farmers has 68.4 million common shares outstanding. <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION> promised that Farmers' operations would be essentially unchanged under the new ownership and Farmers suggested it would drop its fierce resistance to <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION> in hearings before insurance regulators in several states. A joint announcement said that <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION>, Farmers, <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Truck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the reciprocal insurance exchanges managed by Farmers, have agreed to provisions that would assure that the exchanges and their policyholders would not be adversely affected in the merger.

 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s merchandise trade deficit spurted 72 percent to a record 2.65 billion pounds, the equivalent of $ 4.5 billion, in July, the government reported Thursday. Immediately after the report was released, the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> signaled a full percentage point increase in the British commercial banks' base lending rate to 12 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Barlcays </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Midland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Lloyds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Westminster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> quickly responded. That was the eighth time the central bank signaled an increase in the benchmark rate since early June when it stood at a 10-year low of 7.5 percent. All the previous increases had been half-point gains. Stock prices plunged, but the pound, uncertain, darted up and down on the news. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index, which had been down just about 3 points earlier, fell 50.6 points, or 2.8 percent, to 1,768.6 by 2:00 p.m. The pound was quoted at 1.6805 dollars after the news vs. 1.6915 dollars before. Chancellor of the Exchequer <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> said the interest rate hike was necessary and that interest rates would remain at current levels from some time. `` The import figures confirm that the economy has been growing too fast. We have to slow it down and that means higher interest rates,'' <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> said in a <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> radio interview. `` The government is determined to do whatever is necessary to keep inflation under control,'' <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> said. The deficit compared with a revised shortfall off 1.54 billion pounds -LRB- 2.6 billion dollars -RRB- in June and a 1.02 billion-pound -LRB- 1.7 billion-dollar -RRB- gap in July 1987, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> said. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s current account deficit spurted to 2.15 billion pounds -LRB- $ 3.6 billion -RRB- in July, compared with a revised deficit of 1.04 billion pounds -LRB- $ 1.8 billion -RRB- in June and a deficit of 323 million pounds -LRB- $ 546 million -RRB- in July 1987. The current account includes `` invisible'' trade, such as services, overseas investment earnings and official transfer payments, which was estimated to be in surplus by 500 million pounds -LRB- $ 845 million -RRB- in July. July's deficits were much larger than expected by the markets, which had anticipated a merchandise trade gap of 1.51 billion pounds -LRB- $ 2.6 billion -RRB- and a current account deficit of 1.01 billion pounds -LRB- $ 1.7 billion -RRB-. The department originally reported June's trade deficit as 1.52 billion pounds -LRB- $ 2.6 billion -RRB- and the current account deficit as 1.02 billion pounds -LRB- $ 1.7 billion -RRB-.

 Contract talks between ailing <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and its flight attendants union are at an impasse, and the airline is seeking federal mediation, according to <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> and union representatives. The union made a proposal countering the company's offer at a Tuesday meeting, but <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> rejected it without discussion, flight attendants union spokeswoman <PERSON> Lois </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> said Wednesday. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Loflin </PERSON> refuted that statement today. `` We were willing to negotiate,'' he said. <PERSON> Loflin </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> officials asked the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mediation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Wednesday to bring a federal mediator into the negotiations. New contract talks have not been scheduled yet. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> management has been seeking $ 90 million in wage reductions from the <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Attendants </ORGANIZATION> over three years, as part of its plan for financial recovery. The union's counter-proposal involved smaller wage cuts, Ms. <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> said. `` At this point, we're considering options,'' she said. The flight attendants' contract expires on Aug. 31. Under federal labor rules, the union could strike at the end of a 30-day `` cooling-off'' period following the declaration of an impasse by the mediator. <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, the union's president, issued a statement contending <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>'s latest action shows it intended to take labor relations `` back to the dark ages.'' She asked for a congressional investigation into <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> and its actions in the negotiations. Members of the largest union at <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>, recently rejected a wage freeze agreement that would have saved the company an estimated $ 81 million over three years. The <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> union also has asked for federal mediation. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> had a net loss of $ 265.3 million last year and is seeking about $ 540 million in pay cuts and other concessions over three years to turn itself around. Its chairman, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Plaskett </PERSON>, recently said the airline might sell its Latin American routes if labor concessions are not made. The two unions representing pilots and flight engineers at <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> agreed earlier this year to wage cuts totaling about $ 240 million over three years. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> also has imposed $ 35 million in cuts under federal labor rules on employees represented by the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> union.

 The stock market opened lower today, unable to extend the brisk rally of the previous session. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which climbed 37.34 points on Wednesday, was down 14.40 at 2,012.27 after 30 minutes of trading. Declining issues outpaced gainers by a margin of 7 to 2 among issues listed on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with 199 up, 713 down and 455 unchanged. <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> volume amounted to 19.69 million shares as of 10 a.m. on Wall Street compared with 18.09 million shares at the same point Wednesday. Analysts said interest rate worries continued to weigh upon the market. Before the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> stock market opened today, the West German central bank raised a key lending rate and banks in several other European countries followed suit. Those developments sent the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bond market lower in early trading. The 30-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bond, for instance, lost about $ 7.50 for every $ 1,000 in face value while its yield jumped to 9.47 percent from 9.40 percent. Analysts said the increase in European rates stirred speculation that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> rates could also be headed higher. That hurt stocks because higher rates could cut corporate profits and make government notes and bonds more attractive. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government's announcement today that it had revised its estimate of second-quarter economic growth upward to 3.3 percent rate from 3.1 percent had been anticipated and appeared to have little impact on the market. Today's activity comes on the first anniversary of the Dow Jones industrial average's peak of 2,722.42. Among the early active issues on the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> was off -RCB- at 112, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> fell -LCB- to 28 \ and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Relegraph </PERSON> was down \ at 24 -RCB- In over-the-counter trading, <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> was up -LCB- at 69 -RCB-. The company agreed to a $ 75-a-share takeover offer from B.A.T. Industries of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> index was off 0.95 at 146.98. On the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the composite market value index fell 0.64 to 293.42. On Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average climbed 37.34 points to 2,026.67, its biggest gain in nearly a month.

<HEAD>Survey Shows 95 Percent of Business Travelers Receive No Training</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A survey revealed that 95 percent of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s business travelers received no training on how to efficiently and effectively travel. In addition, 72 percent of the corporate travel planners said their companies did not provide formal training or orientation about business travel for their employees, according to the survey commissioned by the non-profit <ORGANIZATION> Marriott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Tierney </PERSON>, executive director of the institute, said American business spends more than $ 66 billion annually on business travel and $ 32 billion on training as a whole, but not on traveling. He said many business travelers are not properly prepared for the rigors of travel and become frustrated as soon as they pack their bags. `` This frustration leads to a tired, hassled traveler whose ability to be productive, and to conduct business on the road, can be seriously affected,'' he said. Those frustrations can come from wasted time at airports, hotels and car rental agencies. Untrained travelers often do not request advanced boarding passes for their flights, do n't know that they can ask for rental car express reservation, and fail to use express or video checkout at hotels. `` By understanding these and other basic ins and outs of business travel _ which can be communicated in employee training programs _ business travelers can improve their efficiency and effectiveness, and find the rigors of travel less stressful,'' <PERSON> Tierney </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> MBTI </ORGANIZATION> was established earlier this year to research, observe, monitor and report issues, trends and developments that have an impact on present day business travel. In the survey, the <ORGANIZATION> MBTI </ORGANIZATION> asked 75 business travelers if they had received any formal training or orientation from their employers before they took their first business trip. Those who had not received training then were asked about benefits they would have received if formal training had been offered. The benefits mentioned most were reductions in stress and cost, better use of time, greater productivity and more enjoyment. The corporate travel managers questioned agreed with the benefits and added that a well-trained traveler projects a more professional image.

 <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said it has secured $ 1.2 billion in credit for the stock repurchase program it created as part of a settlement with a dissident shareholder group that fought for control of the toiletry company. A syndicate of banks will supply the credit, including $ 730 million to buy back stock from shareholders, <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. The stock repurchase plan was announced earlier this month as part of an out-of-court settlement that ended a bitter proxy fight between <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investment firm. <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> wanted control of <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION>'s board to sell the company to the highest bidder. Both sides sued each other, charging violations of of federal securities laws during the proxy fight. Under the stock buyback plan, stockholders will be able to sell one-seventh of their shares to <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> at or above a market price of $ 45. Stockholders also have the right to sell their options. <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> said it plans to repurchase 16 million shares of its 112 million outstanding shares. <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION>'s largest shareholder, would net a profit of about $ 14.4 million before expenses by selling back 1.1 million shares.

<HEAD>Consumer Price Inflation Continues Slide</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Consumer prices continue to ease under a tough government anti-inflation program, with prices rising 0.7 percent in the first half of August, the <ORGANIZATION> central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mexico </ORGANIZATION> announced Wednesday night. It predicted smaller increases in consumer prices for the remainder of the month once sales taxes are reduced and other measures taken under the government's Economic Solidarity Pact. The central bank attributed most of the rise in the consumer price index to `` residual effects'' of price hikes for meat and services in the final days of July. `` Without this influence, the Index would have remained practically stable,'' the bank said in a statement. Prices for fruits, fresh vegetables, sugar, personal items and electric appliances actually fell between Aug. 1-15, while rents, at two percent, and clothing, at 1.2 percent, led price gains. The bank forecast even lower inflation for the rest of August because of reductions in the value added tax for basic goods and medicines that went into effect Aug. 18. The government enacted its Economic Solidarity Pact in December as inflation was reaching a record 159.2 percent for all of 1987. A freeze on the peso currency exchange rate, the federal minimum wage and prices for government-regulated goods and services forms the centerpiece of the program. Under the pact, inflation reached 43.3 percent for the first seven months of 1988, while the annual rate since July 1987 was 122.3 percent. On Aug. 14, the government announced modifications to the pact and extended it to Nov. 30, President <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>'s last day in office. While maintaining the freezing of wages, official prices and the peso exchange rate, the government said it would reduce sales taxes from six to zero percent on processed foods and medicines by Sept. 1. It also ordered retailers to reduce prices for their goods an average of 3 percent compared to prices in effect between July 7 and August 7. On Saturday, <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> inspectors closed several <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> pharmacies for failing to abide by the new price guidelines. Commerce Secretary <PERSON> Hector </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Cervantes </PERSON> said Wednesday the government will launch a national media campaign reminding consumers that savings from the sales tax reductions must be reflected in prices at the cash register. The ads will urge consumers to report suspected violations to authorities. The government also plans to publish lists of retailers' prices for thousands of consumer items to compel compliance with the pact, <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Cervantes </PERSON> said.

 The economy expanded at a brisk annual rate of 3.3 percent from April through June in spite of a severe shock from the drought that seared much of the country, the government reported today. The gross national product, the broadest measure of economic health, expanded at essentially the same rate as in the first quarter, when the GNP rose at an annual rate of 3.4 percent. But inflation in the second quarter, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said, was accelerating at its fastest pace in almost six years. `` The economy is growing much too fast and if it is n't reigned in quickly, it is surely going to mean that inflation will be much more pronounced,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dederick </PERSON>, chief economist for <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` It is nice to grow fast in the early stages of an expansion when you have a lot of unemployemnt, but at this stage we just ca n't afford it,'' he said. The robust 3.3 percent growth rate occurred despite the fact that the impact of the drought on farm production shaved a full percentage point from second quarter growth, the government said today. Without the drought, the GNP would have shot up at a 4.3 percent annual rate in the April-June period. The government estimated that the drought will reduce farm output by $ 14.3 billion in 1988, shaving about 0.4 percentage point from growth for the full year. Even with the troubles in the farm belt, however, the economy continued to show its resiliency, propelled by a sharp turnaround in the country's trade deficit and strong growth in business investment and consumer spending. But inflation accelerated as well, with a GNP price index that measures a changing market basket of goods rising at an annual rate of 5.1 percent, the fastest increase since a 5.8 percent rise in the third quarter of 1982. The big surge in inflation, which followed an increase of 1.7 percent in the first quarter, was blamed on higher consumer prices for clothing, food and gasoline. The burst of inflation served to emphasize the problems facing the expansion, which has already lasted a peacetime record of 69 months. With growth so robust, the economy is beginning to see rising inflationary pressures from tight labor markets and demand outstripping production. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> since March has been pushing interest rates higher to dampen demand, but many economists are worried that unless growth slows in the coming quarters, the central bank will have to clamp down even harder and risk pushing the country into a recession in 1989. In good news for Republican presidential chances, however, economists see no likelihood that economic growth will slow appreciably before the Nov. 8 election. Many analysts believe the economy in the current quarter may be expanding at an even faster rate than in the spring. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has already boosted its economic growth projection for the full year to 3.5 percent, which would be the best performance since 1984. Today's GNP estimate of 3.3 percent for the second quarter represented an upward revision from a month ago, when the government put GNP growth at a lower 3.1 percent during the quarter. The improvement came from higher spending by the federal goverment, consumers and businesses than previously estimated. The trade deficit shrank at an annual rate of $ 18.9 billion in the second quarter, the best showing since 1980. This coupled with a 2.7 percent rise in consumer spending and a sharp 17.9 percent advance in business investment provided much of the economy's strength during the quarter. This strength was offset somewhat by the drought. Originally, the government had estimated that the drought reduced GNP growth by one-half percentage point in the second quarter. With farm losses mounting, however, the government has doubled the adverse impact, saying that farm losses totaled $ 9.5 billion at an annual rate in the second quarter. Analysts estimated that figure would rise even higher in the third and fourth quarters. The various changes left the GNP, after adjusting for inflation, at an annual rate of $ 3.99 trillion in the second quarter. In other good news, the government said today that after-tax corporate profits shot up 11.5 percent in the second quarter following a 2.5 percent rise in the first quarter. The performance was the best showing since a 14.5 percent rise in the second quarter of 1983. Many private economists believe that the administration's growth estimate for the entire year is too low. The monthly survey of 51 top economists by <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indicators </ORGANIZATION>, a financial newsletter, put the consensus estimate of GNP growth for this year at 3.8 percent. The economy has shown surprising strength this year. In the wake of last October's stock market collapse, many analysts were forecasting a recession this year. However, growth has stayed at strong levels, propelled by a big turnaround in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit which has boosted the fortunes of American manufacturing companies. Consumer spending and business investment to expand production facilities also have contributed to the strength this year. This rapid growth has helped push unemployment down to 14-year lows. But the rapid growth also has begun to push up against supply restraints because of tight labor markets and high operating rates in many industries. This often translates into rising inflationary pressures as workers demand higher wages and businesses boost prices. To fight the inflationary pressures, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> since late March has been boosting interest rates to dampen demand. Earlier this month, it hiked its discount rate one-half percentage point to 6.5 percent. This credit tightening, many economists believe, will slow growth starting in the fourth quarter and extending into next year. Some analysts are worried that if inflationary pressures continue to increase and the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> is forced to clamp down further, the risks of a substantial slowdown and possibly even a recession will rise for 1989.

<HEAD>West Germans Raise Key Interest Rates; Other Europeans Follow</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s central bank raised a key interest rate today to 3.5 percent from 3 percent because of the stronger dollar, and central banks in several Western European countries quickly followed. The action marked the latest in a round of higher interest rates worldwide and came a few weeks after the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> tightened credit in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by pushing interest rates higher. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency slumped in response to the action today by the West German <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> and other European banks. The dollar was quoted at around 1.8660 West German marks at midmorning in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, down sharply from 1.8820 marks late Wednesday. In <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> signaled a full percentage point increase in the British commercial banks' base lending rate to 12 percent, following a government report on the country's trade deficit in July. The report showed the July trade gap soared 72 percent to a record 2.65 billion pounds, or about $ 4.5 billion. The central banks of <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> announced interest rate hikes shortly after the <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> move. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, however, a senior <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> official said there is `` absolutely no need to consider an adjustment in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s monetary policy just because the <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> raised their base rates.'' The higher West German discount rate goes into effect on Friday, the <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. The discount rate is the interest the <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> charges on loans to other banks. The <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> was selling dollars in the open market shortly after making its announcement, according to currency dealers in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> <PERSON> Poehl </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION>, cited the weakness of the West German mark against the dollar as a reason for lifting the key rate, which makes mark-denominated investments more attractive. `` Today's step is an important signal which will be understood by the foreign-exchange and capital markets,'' <PERSON> Poehl </PERSON> said. `` It should lead to stabilization of the -LRB- currency -RRB- and capital markets and the first reactions should show this is the case.'' Following the <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> action, the dollar slid to 1.8640 marks at the <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> currency exchange in early afternoon. Earlier, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency had fallen to an official <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> fixing of 1.8764 marks from Wednesday's official level of 1.8960 marks. <PERSON> Poehl </PERSON> told reporters that the dollar's strength against the mark endangered efforts to adjust trade imbalances between the world's major trading partners He also said the <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> will `` continue to do everything to stem the decline of the mark against the dollar.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> president also said the discount rate increase was aimed at curbing West German inflation and bringing the country's above-target money supply growth back into the proper range. The <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> has adjusted domestic interest rates upwards three times in the past eight weeks.

 Stock prices fell broadly today, weighed down once again by worries about interest rates. But the pace of trading remained sluggish. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which climbed 37.34 points on Wednesday, was down 18.31 at 2,008.36 after 90 minutes of trading. Declining issues outpaced gainers by a margin of 3 to 1 among issues listed on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with 273 up, 956 down and 439 unchanged. <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> volume amounted to 48.32 million shares as of 11 a.m. on Wall Street compared with 42.58 million shares at the same point Wednesday. Analysts said stocks suffered from renewed interest rate worries. Before the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stock market opened today, the West German central bank raised a key lending rate and banks in several other European countries followed suit. Analysts said the increase in European rates stirred speculation that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> rates could also be headed higher. That hurt stocks because higher rates could cut corporate profits and make government notes and bonds more attractive. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government said today it had revised upward its estimate of second-quarter economic growth to 3.3 percent rate from 3.1 percent. While that revision was in line with expectations, analysts said a simultaneous upward revision in an inflation measure tied to the gross national product worried some traders. Prices in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> credit market moved lower in the early going, pushing interest rates higher. The 30-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bond, for instance, lost about $ 7.50 for every $ 1,000 in face value while its yield jumped to 9.47 percent from 9.40 percent. Today's activity comes on the first anniversary of the Dow Jones industrial average's peak of 2,722.42.

 <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s economy and corporate profits expanded briskly this spring, the government said today, but the news was overshadowed by higher inflation, rising interest rates, slumping financial markets and a slowdown in home sales. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the gross national product, the broadest measure of economic health, rose at an annual rate of 3.3 percent from April through June despite severe shock from the drought that seared much of the country. The GNP rate of expansion was unchanged from the first quarter. Without the drought, the GNP would have shot up at a 4.3 percent annual rate in the April-June period. The government also said after-tax corporate profits shot up 11.5 percent in the second quarter following a 2.5 percent rise in the first quarter. The performance was the best since a 14.5 percent rise in the 1983 second quarter. But April-June inflation as measured by a GNP price index rose at an annual rate of 5.1 percent, the fastest increase since a 5.8 percent rise in the third quarter of 1982, the department said. The surge was blamed on higher prices for clothes, food and fuel. Further obscuring the GNP and corporate profit news was that key West European nations raised interest rates today, blaming the move on the stronger <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar and consequent weakness in their own currencies. The increases signaled another round of higher interest rates worldwide. Those developments helped incite a selloff in the bond market, a sensitive barometer of interest rates and the economy. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s key 30-year issue fell nearly $ 7.50 per $ 1,000 in face amount and its yield rose to 9.46 percent from 9.39 percent late Wednesday. On Wall Street, where traders were recalling the stock market peak a year ago today, prices slid as well. The Dow Jones industrial average was down about 18 points to the 2,008 level by late morning. Rising interest rates also played a key role in a 5 percent drop in existing single-family home sales last month, a real estate trade group said today. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION> said the decline was partly the result of higher mortgage costs. The developments came a day after the government reported <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s trade deficit shrank 15 percent in the April-June quarter, which heartened Republicans fighting to retain the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> but did n't impress the financial markets. The difference between what the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> spends and sells abroad narrowed to a deficit of $ 29.9 billion in the second quarter, compared with a $ 35.2 billion deficit in the first quarter. Many economists regard the trade deficit as one of the most visible weaknesses in the economy, reflecting a relentless addiction to cheap imports and consequent difficulty for domestic companies trying to compete. Democrats have attempted to make the trade deficit an issue in the presidential campaign. But the improvement reported Wednesday suggested <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturers were making strong gains in selling abroad. Some economists are predicting the trade deficit will drop by nearly 25 percent for the entire year, marking the first annual improvement since President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> took office. Republicans are hoping voters will focus on the improvement, which already has shown up in the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s monthly merchandise trade reports. In other economic news, major automakers said Wednesday that mid-August sales of U.S.-made cars and trucks fell by 13.2 percent from the same period a year earlier, when sales were inflated by buyers taking advantage of dealer incentives.

 Grain and soybean futures prices opened mixed today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. Traders started out looking for confirmation of rumors that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> was planning a big soyoil purchase that would be subsidized under the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> export bonus program.

That pact, the first step in what is anticipated to result in another five-year deal between the superpowers, still is expected to be complete sometime soon. On the opening, wheat was 3 cents to 4 -LCB- cents higher, with the contract for delivery in September at $ 3.94 a bushel; oats were -LCB- cent to 1 \ cents higher, with September at $ 2.54 -LCB-; corn was -RCB- cent to 2 -LCB- cents higher, with September at $ 2.85 a bushel; and soybeans were 6 cents lower to 7 cents higher, with September at $ 8.35 a bushel Livestock and meat futures prices opened mixed at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>.

 A federal judge today denied motions for a new trial for a <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> entrepreneur, the former president of the <ORGANIZATION> Seven-Up </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and a soft drink bottler who had been convicted of price fixing. <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lapides </PERSON>, 57, chairman of the board of <ORGANIZATION> Alleghany </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beverage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Cheverly </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Harford </PERSON>, former president of <ORGANIZATION> Mid-Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bottling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Silver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Spring </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Alleghany </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bottling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> were convicted following a six-week trial in April and May. <PERSON> Lapides </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harford </PERSON> face a maximum three years in prison. <ORGANIZATION> Alleghany </ORGANIZATION> faces a maximum $ 1 million fine. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Doumar </PERSON> was expected to impose sentences today. `` I am very concerned with restitution to the public,'' <PERSON> Doumar </PERSON> said. `` People who believe money is the answer to any crime because they are a corporation should think differently when they enter this court.' At the time of his conviction, <PERSON> Harford </PERSON> was the president of <ORGANIZATION> Seven-Up </ORGANIZATION>, but resigned that post three days after the conviction. <PERSON> Harford </PERSON>'s conviction was the result of actions while heading the <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> bottling firm, and did not involve Seven-Up. The convictions were part of an on-going <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> probe of the soft drink industry, which has resulted in 11 grand jury investigations in eight other states. <PERSON> Lapides </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harford </PERSON> were convicted of rigging the wholesale price of their respective products in 1983 and 1984. <ORGANIZATION> Alleghany </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beverage </ORGANIZATION> was the parent company of <ORGANIZATION> Alleghany </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi-Cola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bottling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> until 1985 when <PERSON> Lapides </PERSON> sold the subsidiary for $ 160 million. During the trial, the defense contended that neither man knew of the scheme and that if the allegations were true, then it was the work of lower level employees who made decisions without their bosses' knowledge. Federal prosecutors argued that the two bottlers reached an accord to halt the previous bitter competition by fixing the wholesale price of their products sold to schools, motels, hotels, and other commercial buyers in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virgina </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Mid-Atlantic </LOCATION> pleaded guilty to earlier, similar indictments and agreed to pay $ 2 million in fines for price rigging in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, markets. In March, both bottling firms also agreed to rebate $ 45,000 to <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> to be distributed to school districts for overcharges on their soft drink purchases. The agreement drawn up by Attorney General <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> called for <LOCATION> Mid-Atlantic </LOCATION> to pay $ 30,000 and <ORGANIZATION> Alleghany </ORGANIZATION> $ 15,000. Prior to the April conviction, several other soft drink executives have been found guilty or pleaded guilty to a variety of charges. In February 1987, <PERSON> Armand </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gravely </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> division manager for <ORGANIZATION> Alleghany </ORGANIZATION>, was convicted of price fixing and obstruction of justice. He was sentenced to four months in jail and fined $ 15,000. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wynns </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Mid-Atlantic </LOCATION> vice president, pleaded guilty in May 1987 to charges he lied to the grand jury investigating the price fixing. The former president of <ORGANIZATION> Alleghany </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bottling </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheridan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Timonium </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, was given a 3-year sentence, with all but 120 days suspended, and fined $ 45,000 in August 1987 after pleading guilty to price fixing.

<HEAD>120,000 Alligator Skins Smuggled Into Japan, Report Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 More than 120,000 skins of a protected species of alligator were smuggled into <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> during the past seven months using stolen or falsified export documents, a wildlife protection organization said Thursday. Traffic <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the wildlife trade monitoring group of the World Wide Fund for Nature, said the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> caiman skins were shipped by a complex route involving at least seven <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> countries before they arrived in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. At least 46 tons of the skins, from more than 120,000 alligators, entered <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in the first seven months of this year through <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> alone, the group said. It said it believed the skins were part of a larger shipment that was loaded onto Asia-bound ships off the coast of <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> at the end of last year. The declared customs value of the skins was about 427 million yen -LRB- about $ 3.2 million -RRB-, `` but retail value would be four to five times more,'' spokeswoman <PERSON> Cecila </PERSON> <PERSON> Song </PERSON> said. The skins are used in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> mainly for belts and watchbands. Permits are required for the export of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> caiman skins under the regulations of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species -LRB- CITES -RRB-, an international treaty regulating trade in protected plants and animals, Song said. Japanese officials allowed the shipments to enter the country without proper verification of the export documents, the group said in a statement. `` Traffic's 8-month investigation has revealed a serious lapse of CITES administration in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, and has uncovered a long paper trail of illegal CITES documents and other ploys involving <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> to mask the illegal origins of the poached skins,'' the statement said. It said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> had responded to evidence of illegal caiman trade by instituting a new voluntary check system on all imports of the skins. `` But unless they come up with a system involving legal penalties, we do n't think there will be any improvement, especially with the high profits involved,'' Song said. Ministry officials were not available Thursday night for comment.

 The stock market retreated broadly today, weighed down by worries about rising interest rates a year to the day after the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average closed at its all-time high. The level of trading was up from the previous session, but was still relatively sluggish. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which climbed 37.34 points on Wednesday, was down 27.56 to 1,999.11 at noontime. Today's decline comes on the first anniversary of the Dow Jones industrial average reaching its record close of 2,722.42 last Aug. 25. Declining issues outpaced gainers by a margin of 5 to 3 among issues listed on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with 287 up, 1,044 down and 443 unchanged. <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> volume amounted to 67.45 million shares as of noon on Wall Street compared with 59.85 million shares at the same point Wednesday.

Northeast Utilities was the most active issue on the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> with more than 11.7 million shares traded by midday. It was unchanged at 19.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Upholds CNW Sale</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal appeals court has ruled that <ORGANIZATION> CNW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> may sell 208 miles of railroad without giving labor unions a voice in the sale. The decision by the 7th <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> affirms an earlier <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling. The decision also bars a threatened strike against <ORGANIZATION> CNW </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> railroad by unions opposed to the proposed track sale. The <ORGANIZATION> Railway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Executives </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> had filed a motion to stop the railroad from closing the sale to <ORGANIZATION> FRVR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> Itel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The association said Wednesday it was considering appealing the circuit court decision to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. The labor group, citing the Railway Labor Act, had argued that the railroad was obligated to negotiate over the effects of the sale on its employees because it will result in changed pay, seniority and working conditions. <ORGANIZATION> CNW </ORGANIZATION> contended the labor issues involved constitute a minor dispute that should be resolved in binding arbitration. `` We are free to sell branch lines to regional line operators,'' said company spokesman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Foote </PERSON> after the ruling. `` The decision means the unions ca n't strike over the sale because it's a minor dispute.'' The section of track, which runs from <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, will be called the <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> River </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> after the sale to FRVR is complete, <PERSON> Foote </PERSON> said. Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> CNW </ORGANIZATION> is the holding company for the railroad, a leading <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> freight hauler that also operates area commuter trains used by 41,000 people. The sale of the line is not related to a contract dispute over train crew size that caused a brief strike at C & amp; NW earlier this month. The walkout was halted by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, which extended a cooling-off period until Sept. 9.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said today it believes the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s jet fighter program has benefitted from the diversion of <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> milling equipment in a case of illegal exporting that rivals the wrongdoing by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said a French concern by the name of <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> is under investigation by authorities in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` The investigation involves the alleged diversion of dozens of very sophisticated milling machines to military users in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> added. `` We believe the machines were used in the Soviet MiG -LRB- jet fighter -RRB- program.'' <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> was asked about the investigation after another top <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> official, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryen </PERSON>, told a group of <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> reporters Wednesday that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities have been deeply involved in investigating a `` serious'' technology diversion case. <PERSON> Bryen </PERSON>, the deputy undersecretary of defense for trade security policy, refused at the time to identify the company under investigation. He said only that American investigators were receiving `` splendid cooperation'' in the matter; that some individuals already had been charged and other arrests would follow, and that he hoped to make more information available in a few months. Other government sources then disclosed Wednesday the investigation concerned a French company known as Forest Line that once went by the name of <PERSON> Ratier-Forest </PERSON>, and that information was subsequently acknowledged by <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>. `` The case ... involves a French company which is currently under investigation by the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> government,'' said <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>. `` The company name is Forest Line.'' The other sources, who insisted on anonymity, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence agents tipped the French early this year about alleged Forest Line sales of heavy milling equipment to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` There has been good cooperation,'' said one source. `` We shared information with them and they moved quickly.'' The French case surfaced last spring but attracted little notice then. French authorities disclosed in April that four people had been arrested under anti-espionage laws, including <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Tardy </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francaises </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lourdes </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Jean-Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamouton </PERSON>, president of Forest Line. Machines <PERSON> Francaises </PERSON> <PERSON> Lourdes </PERSON>, now bankrupt, was the parent company of <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION>, which specialized in manufacturing heavy tool equipment. No trials have been held, and the status of the cases is unclear. The <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> scandal came to a head earlier this year when the <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a majority-owned subsidiary, was found guilty in a Japanese court of illegally trading high-tech items with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The firm was convicted of selling sophisticated milling machines to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in the early 1980s. The machines can be used to fashion quiet submarine propellers. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military experts claim the <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> sale has complicated dramatically the task of locating Russian subs. <PERSON> Bryen </PERSON>, while never naming the company now under investigation, drew attention to the matter Wednesday when asked if the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> had become involved in any other major export probes since <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION>. `` There's even a bigger one, but it's different,'' <PERSON> Bryen </PERSON> replied. `` It's a different kind of case because, first of all, we've had splendid cooperation on it. There's more, much more involved than the <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> case. `` It's certainly serious and it's in a different field; it's in the aerospace area,'' he said. `` It's under investigation and there have already been some equivalent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> indictments on the case, in another country. There's going to be some others. `` But I'm going to be real cagey on this because I do n't want to spring it yet. But I think in the next few months we should be prepared to describe it in more detail.'' Asked if any <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizens were known to be involved, he replied: `` Not that I know of at the moment.'' The Toshiba incident helped lead to enactment of new trade legislation and sanctions against that company in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as well as a Japanese government overhaul of export licensing procedures. Last fall, when revelations about the <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> case were surfacing, a Norwegian police investigation found that several <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> companies _ including <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> _ had conspired to divert sensitive technology to the Soviets dating back to the 1970s. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sources said Wednesday, however, that the current investigation involved equipment sales that continued at least through 1986 and possibly 1987 _ long after the last <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> transaction. `` That's what makes it serious,'' one source said. The Forest Line equipment, said to include huge milling machinery that can be used to fabricate aircraft fuselages and jet engine turbine blades, was allegedly sold to the Soviets after corporate executives submitted fraudulent applications for export licenses, the sources said. <PERSON> Bryen </PERSON> told reporters the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has made great strides in clamping down on the exports of sensitive military technology to the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc and in convincing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allies to do the same.

<HEAD>Americans Sing for Success in Japan</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 If the thought of giving an after-dinner speech makes you nervous, singing in a foreign language for prospective clients might cause you to lose your appetite. <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> <PERSON> Fujiyama </PERSON> did not like the idea, but after socializing with Japanese clients, he realized American business skills were not enough to assure success in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. He spoke Japanese, but, he says, he needed to learn to sing it. `` If you're going to succeed as a businessman, you have to do business the way they do it, and in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, everybody sings,'' says <PERSON> Fujiyama </PERSON>. `` Everybody from the ordinary salary worker to the corporate presidents and executives.'' The songfests usually begin after a business meeting or social gathering, he says, when the company's executives take their turn at the microphone singing popular Japanese tunes. After they are finished, their guests, such as <PERSON> Fujiyama </PERSON>, are invited to give it a go. `` For you to refuse is a great insult, but to sing badly is even worse,'' he says. So <PERSON> Fujiyama </PERSON> began to practice, first by singing along in his car with `` karaoke'' tapes, which are high-quality instrumental versions of popular songs. Later, one of his Japanese clients gave him with an elaborate sound system for his downtown <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> office, complete with laser disk, two tape players and an oversized video screen so he could watch his technique. A star was not quite born, but <PERSON> Fujiyama </PERSON> swears he is improving. `` I still do n't want to sing out in public, but I've gotten better. I can carry a tune now,'' he says. <PERSON> Fujiyama </PERSON> can not explain the cultural differences that cause Japanese _ young and old _ to sing at home along with variety shows -LRB- which flash the lyrics on the television screen -RRB- and at `` karaoke'' bars with professional equipment, light shows and audiences; while Americans tend to sing in their cars with the windows rolled up and are relieved when they manage `` Happy Birthday'' without embarrassing themselves. But <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Feltz </PERSON>, who specializes in Japanese culture at the <ORGANIZATION> East-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> here, has some ideas. `` Japanese, as in many countries, are not as ashamed of singing as we are in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' says <PERSON> Feltz </PERSON>, who as an ethnomusicologist studies music of <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> cultures. `` There you're not expected to sing like <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Springsteen </PERSON> or <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> <PERSON> Sills </PERSON>. In many <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> cultures, <PERSON> Feltz </PERSON> says, people have a common repertoire and sing songs they learned as children for their entire lives. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, he said, more emphasis is put on the quality, so elementary school students who once belted out `` My country' t is of thee ...'' with abandon learn to be self-conscious and clam up as they grow older That's what happened to <PERSON> Adrian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mangiboyat </PERSON>, 32, who left his job as a reporter for the <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> here to teach English in a Japanese village. `` I guess I sang at school as a little kid, but I outgrew that. I never sang along with the radio, in the shower, nothing like that,'' he says. `` But when I applied for the job -LRB- in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> -RRB- they said singing was an integral part of Japanese culture, and I knew I was in trouble.'' <PERSON> Mangiboyat </PERSON> earned the teaching position in a program sponsored by the Japanese government, but before he departed for <PERSON> Yabuki-Machi </PERSON>, a small town 100 miles north of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, he enrolled at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hawaii </ORGANIZATION>. In a nine-week course called `` Voice Training for the Tone Deaf,'' Mangiboyat and other would-be warblers spent two hours a week learning scales, pitch and simple songs. Their homework included taking the stage at a local `` karaoke'' bar popular with Japanese tourists. `` The Japanese officials said being able to sing will give me an edge with my students and the other villagers. It will show them that I really tried to learn about their culture.'' <PERSON> Fujiyama </PERSON> agrees. `` By asking you to sing with them, they're saying ` let's be friends.'''

<HEAD>West German Central Bank Raises Key Interest Rate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s central bank raised a key interest rate Thursday to defend the value of its currency and fend off inflation, leading a round of rate hikes in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> raised its discount rate, which it charges on loans to other banks, by half a percentage point to 3.5 percent. <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> <PERSON> Poehl </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION>, cited the weakness of the mark against the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar as a main reason for lifting the discount rate. The higher discount rate should cause other interest rates to rise. That would support the exchange value of the mark by making mark-denominated investments more attractive. The dollar eased more than a pfennig to level around 1.8650 marks soon after the <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> followed the <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION>'s lead and raised rates. `` Today's step is an important signal which will be understood by the foreign exchange and capital markets,'' <PERSON> Poehl </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Poehl </PERSON> told reporters that the dollar's strength against the mark endangered efforts to adjust trade imbalances between the world's major trading partners He also said the <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> will `` continue to do everything to stem the decline of the mark against the dollar.'' <PERSON> Poehl </PERSON> also said the discount rate increase was aimed at curbing inflation and bringing the country's above-target money supply growth back into the proper range. The mark's weakness has contributed to inflation by raising import prices. The <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> decided to keep its Lombard rate steady at 5 percent, and indicated no change in its rate on securities repurchase agreements. The <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> has adjusted German interest rates upwards three times in the past eight weeks. It raised the Lombard rate to 5 percent from 4.5 percent on July 28, following a hike in the discount rate to 3 percent from 2.5 percent on June 30.

<NOTE>Eds: New throughout with closing index.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Stocks fell sharply Thursday following news of a British trade deficit in July that was nearly double market expectations and a subsequent hike in British interest rates. A sagging start on Wall Street also depressed share prices. The <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times-Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> 100-share index fell 39 points, or 2.1 percent, to close at 1,780.2. Earlier in the afternoon, the index was down more than 50 points. Volume was a relatively strong 399.3 million shares by midafternoon. Following the trade figure release, the Bank of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> signaled a 1 percentage point hike to 12 percent in the British commercial banks' base lending rate. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s merchandise trade deficit spurted to a record 2.65 billion pounds, equivalent to $ 4.5 billion, in July, compared with a revised shortfall of $ 1.54 billion in June. The country's current account deficit, which includes invisible trade such as overseas investment earnings as well as merchandise trade, spurted to 2.15 billion pounds in July, compared with a revised deficit of 1.04 billion pounds in June.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The British government, trying to curb inflation, on Thursday pushed up interest rates to a 2 -LCB- - year high after announcing a record trade deficit for July that was nearly double the previous record The July deficit and the interest-rate hike, both unexpectedly large, rocked British financial markets. Share prices plummeted on the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> and trading volume picked up. The British pound first fell on the trade news, and then had a mixed reaction to the interest-rate hike. The British rate rise came amid a round of key interest-rate increases in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s central bank, raised its discount rate by half a percentage point to 3.5 percent. The central banks of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> followed the <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION>, hiking their own key rates. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times-Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> 100-share index, which plunged more than 50 points before recovering some of its losses, closed 39 points, or 2.1 percent, lower at 1,768.6, amid moderate trading volume. The pound soared to $ 1.6995 late Thursday from $ 1.6788 late Wednesday, but it fell to 3.16 West German marks from 3.17 marks. The Bank of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> signaled a full percentage point increase in the commercial banks' base lending rate to 12 percent, soon after the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> reported that <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s merchandise trade deficit soared in July to a record 2.65 billion pounds, or about $ 4.5 billion The previous record trade gap was 1.7 billion pounds, or around $ 2.9 billion, in May. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s four leading commercial banks _ <ORGANIZATION> Barclays </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Midland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Lloyds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Westminster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> _ quickly responded to the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>'s signal. Many market watchers had anticipated an increase of only half a percentage point in the base lending rate. It was the eighth increase in the benchmark rate since early June, when the rate stood at a 10-year low of 7.5 percent, and it brought the base lending rate to its highest level since January 1986. The previous hikes were half-point increases, with the most recent coming on Aug. 8. `` The import figures confirm that the economy has been growing too fast. We have to slow it down and that means higher interest rates,'' Chancellor of the Exchequer <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> said. Spurred by <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s strong consumer spending, imports jumped 13 percent, across the board, to 9.43 billion pounds, or about $ 16 billion, in July, while exports fell 0.9 percent to 6.78 billion pounds, or $ 11.5 billion. `` The government is determined to do whatever is necessary to keep inflation under control,'' <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> said in a <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> radio interview. `` The economy as a whole is doing extremely well,'' he added. The full-point interest-rate hike was viewed as a major additional tightening of monetary policy to help reduce the growing inflationary pressures in the economy. Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> has repeatedly said that reducing such pressures is her top economic priority. Inflation in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> increased to an annual rate of 4.8 percent in July from 4.6 percent in June. A spate of recent economic reports has confirmed faster-than-expected growth in the British economy. On Tuesday, for example, the goverment reported that <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s inflation-adjusted gross domestic product, measured by the output of goods and services, rose 1.3 percent in the second quarter from the first The markets had expected a rise of only 1 percent. Recent weakness in the pound, exacerbated by the latest trade report, has given the <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> government room to increase interest rates without pushing the pound dangerously high, which would hurt British exports even more. `` We now have a genuine balance-of-payments crisis. These figures are appalling,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepperd </PERSON>, director of the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Warburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>, referring to the July trade report. The latest trade deficit compared with a 1.02 billion pound, or $ 1.7 billion, gap in July 1987. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s current-account deficit jumped to 2.15 billion pounds in July, up from a revised deficit of 1.04 billion pounds in June and a deficit of 323 million pounds in July 1987. The current account includes `` invisible'' trade, such as services, foreign investment earnings and official transfer payments, which was estimated to be in surplus by 500 million pounds in July.

<HEAD>Grand AM Is No Typical 4-Cylinder</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto and LaserGraphic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN M. JOB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>For The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 It's not often that a compact car with a four-cylinder engine can offer a decent sporty-car ride. But the 1988 Pontiac Grand AM SE is no typical four-cylinder compact. For starters, the standard 2-liter, fuel-injected engine is turbocharged and can produce 165 horspower. <LOCATION> Pontiac </LOCATION> adds it can go from 0 to 60 in a brisk eight seconds. The Grand AM SE's standard suspension package includes <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eagle </ORGANIZATION> GT +4 all-season radial tires and stabilizer bars that make for a firm, stable ride Inside, there's a sporty feel with the thick, leather-wrapped steering wheel, contoured front bucket seats _ molded to hold your body in place _ and turbo boost gauge set amid a sporty driver area. Outside, the Grand AM SE is one of the prettiest of <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s cars, with bumpers and front, side and rear skirts that match the body so there's no gaudy chrome. In fact, the styling, which debuted in the 1985 model year, helps explain why the Grand AM is the <LOCATION> Pontiac </LOCATION> Division's volume leader. From the buyer's perspective, it has snazzy styling, said <LOCATION> Pontiac </LOCATION> spokesman <PERSON> Reggie </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>. Exterior styling and cost are the two main reasons cited by buyers, he added. The lowest-priced Grand AM is $ 10,269, including $ 400 for shipping, <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said. But the SE test car totaled just under $ 15,000. That $ 10,000 - $ 15,000 price range encompasses many of the Grand AM's competitors, such as the <ORGANIZATION> Buick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Skylark </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Dodge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lancer </ORGANIZATION>, which start around $ 10,400, and the <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> Prelude, which starts around $ 13,600 <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> noted the Grand AM _ which comes in three versions, the Grand AM, the LE and the SE _ is particularly adept at luring young buyers. Median age of buyers is 32, with 63 percent under age 35, <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said. Forty-even percent are male, 55 percent are married and 38 percent have college education. Median income is $ 40,000 annually. The test car, an SE, was fun to drive. The suspension and engine, linked to a three-speed automatic transmission, offered somewhat of a muscle-car ride complete with throaty rumble from under the hood during hard accelerations. Handling was admirable, even at high speeds. There was no roll, no sway. The trunk was roomy, and the rear seats split and folded down for more storage space. There were nice touches inside for driver and passengers. Map lights were available in front and rear. Front visors had slits in the material to slip paper, maps, etc., and netting on the back of the front seats offered spots for newspapers, magazines for rear-seat passengers. Controls for the AM-FM stereo and cassette player as well as ventilation were conveniently located at the front of the center console. Fit and finish inside and out was excellent. I noticed a few problems, too. At 5-foot-4, I found it difficult to put the seat belt into its latch alongside the driver seat once I had the seat moved up to where I could touch the pedals comfortably. The seat belt latch was jammed between the driver seat and the center console storage area. It was also difficult to unlatch the belt without first moving the driver seat back a ways, for the same reason. The Grand AM has a cruise control system found in many other <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> cars that is mounted on the turn signal stalk. As with the other <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> cars, I sometimes discovered the lever in the on position even when the cruise was n't actuated. Still, it's unsettling to glance down and see it on. Rear seating, for three, might be snug. The car also gulped down the gasoline. Fuel economy is rated at 20 miles per gallon in the city and 27 mpg on the highway, but in my demanding city-highway driving I did n't get 20. Lastly, the center console had yellow spots that would light up to indicate what gear the automatic transmission was in. But in bright sunlight, it was murder trying to see what gear the shifter had settled in. Consumer Reports says the 1986 Grand AM with four-cylinder engine, the latest model it has information for, had an average record for trouble, up from worse-han-average for the 1985 model. Still, 1988 looks to be the best year for Grand AM yet, with projections of 220,000 sales compared with 216,065 in the 1987 model year and 190,994 in the 1986 model year. We're in great shape for that car line, <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said, noting sales have been on target. He said even <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Kay </PERSON>, the cosmetics company, has ordered a fleet of 5,000 Grand AMs for its employees. But he quickly added they wo n't be pink.

 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airplane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> today announced an order for six 737-500 jetliners, which helped the aircraft manufacturer break the industry record for new plane orders in a single year. The order by <ORGANIZATION> Linjeflyg </ORGANIZATION>, a Swedish domestic airline, sent <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s orders for the year to $ 20.7 billion for 466 planes, breaking the Seattle-based company's own record of 461 orders set in 1978. <ORGANIZATION> Linjeflyg </ORGANIZATION>'s order, including spare parts, was valued at $ 175 million. The airline, a new customer for <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>, also took out an option for six more 737s. The twin-engine jet is designed to carry 108 passengers. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayhurst </PERSON>, vice president of marketing for <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airplanes </ORGANIZATION>, said the outlook for further strong orders for <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> is good. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> is predicting that airline traffic growth will grow by 5 percent a year through 2005, when it will be about 2 -LCB- times busier than today, <PERSON> Hayhurst </PERSON> said. Future traffic growth translates into a need for 7,400 new airplanes between now and 2005, said <PERSON> Hayhurst </PERSON>, who added <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> is well-positioned to get a good share of those orders. Both <ORGANIZATION> GPA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rolls </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, of <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> have said they may be interested in ordering large numbers of <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> planes, possibly this year. `` With the possible order of up to 50 757s pending with <ORGANIZATION> GPA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rolls </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> order and another possible 75 jets which could be used in the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s long-range anti-submarine warfare patrol aircraft program, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> could keep going like gangbusters,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Nisbet </PERSON>, an aerospace analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Longridge </PERSON>, vice president of sales at <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airplanes </ORGANIZATION>, said today's order gives <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> a commercial jet backlog of 1,036. `` This is the highest backlog we have ever had at <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'' and is the highest in the industry, <PERSON> Longridge </PERSON> said. Presently at its <LOCATION> Renton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION> plant, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> is turning out 14 737s and four 757s every month. The production of 757s will increase to five a month next February, <PERSON> Longridge </PERSON> said. At <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> plant, five 767s are being produced a month and three 747s, but plans are to boost that rate to five of the jumbo jets by mid-1989, <PERSON> Longridge </PERSON> said. He declined to say whether these plans mean additional hiring at <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> employment in the Puget Sound region currently stands at about 92,000.

 Stock prices posted some broad losses today, weighed down by worries about rising interest rates. The level of trading was up from the previous session, but was still relatively sluggish. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which climbed 37.34 points on Wednesday, was down 26.31 to 2,000.36 with two hours left in the session. Today's decline comes on the first anniversary of the Dow Jones industrial average reaching its record close of 2,722.42 on Aug. 25, 1987. Declining issues outpaced gainers by a margin of nearly 11 to 3 among issues listed on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with 324 up, 1,071 down and 483 unchanged. <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> volume amounted to 91.26 million shares at 2 p.m. on Wall Street compared with 84.44 million shares at the same point Wednesday.

Analysts said the increase in European rates stirred speculation that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> rates could also be headed higher.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Grain and soybean futures prices ended mixed to slightly higher Thursday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. Analysts described the day as `` featureless'' because few signs of confirmation could be found for a pair of rumors that strongly influenced trading one day earlier. Soybeans were pressured at the opening as speculation that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> was planning a big soyoil purchase under the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> export bonus program failed to gain support. There was some firming up late, however, as the beans closed mostly higher. Wheat climbed across the board on talk of increased export bonus business, despite the fact that reports Wednesday of a completed one-year extension of the grain accord between the Soviets and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> appear to have been premature. On the close, wheat was 2 -RCB- cents to 4 cents higher, with the contract for delivery in September at $ 3.93 -LCB- a bushel; corn was 4 -RCB- cents lower to 1 -LCB- cents higher, with September at $ 2.81 a bushel; oats were 1 cent lower to -LCB- cent higher, with September at $ 2.54 -LCB-; and soybeans were 5 cents lower to 6 cents higher, with September at $ 8.35 a bushel.

<TEXT>
 Gamblers lost a record $ 4.07 billion in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> casinos in fiscal 1988 to give the clubs a 9.8 percent revenue gain over the previous year, a report released Thursday found. <ORGANIZATION> Gaming </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Harlan </PERSON> <PERSON> Elges </PERSON> called the results for the 12 months ended June 30 good, although he noted that 1987 revenue had been a bit higher, 10.2 percent, when compared with 1986. `` There are no downturns, nothing is slowing the casino industry down at this point,'' <PERSON> Elges </PERSON> said. In the <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> area, clubs grossed $ 2.83 billion, or about 70 percent of all winnings, up 10.2 percent from 1987, the board said. In the Reno area, the take was $ 729.3 million, up 7.2 percent from the prior year. In <LOCATION> Douglas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, including clubs on <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tahoe </LOCATION>'s south shore, resorts grossed $ 336.2 million, an 11.2 percent increase. And in <LOCATION> Elko </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, resorts took in $ 94.7 million, up 13.3 percent. <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> <PERSON> City </PERSON> showed the only decrease, with the $ 36.5 million taken in by clubs here reflecting a 2.2 percent decline in the money won from gamblers the year before. That's a slight improvement over fiscal 1987 revenues which were off 2.5 percent.

 <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s agreement to be bought by <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 5.2 billion ends a bitter eight-month battle that included unusual skirmishing over the evils of smoking and investment in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Spokesmen for the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> insurer and the <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, tobacco and retailing conglomerate could n't say Thursday just how many lawsuits and administrative proceedings have been spawned by their fight. But the merger deal, which was announced late Wednesday, calls for the companies to cooperate in unraveling the tangle and cooperating in pressing for approval of the purchase by insurance regulators in various states. Farmers agreed to be bought by <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION> for $ 75 a share, $ 3 a share higher than <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION>' highest previous publicly announced offer and $ 12 more a share than <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION> has been offering stockholders on the market. No date has been set for a needed vote on the merger by shareholders of Farmers, the nations' third-largest home and auto insurer and seventh-biggest property and casualty insurer. <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION>, the American subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> BAT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, owns <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Williamson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, maker of <LOCATION> Kool </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Viceroy </PERSON> and other brands, Appleton Papers and retailiers including <PERSON> Sak </PERSON>'s Fifth Avenue and <LOCATION> Marshall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION>'s. The deal requires the approval of insurance regulators in nine of the states where Farmers does business, and hearings before those regulators were the forum for the most acrimonious accusations in the takover battle. Farmers representatives maintained that <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION>, as a tobacco producer, would end non-smoker discounts for Farmers policy holders. When <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION> vowed to continue the discounts, Farmers suggested ownership by <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION> would prevent it from crusading against smoking as strongly as it has in the past. Farmers also lined up numerous local, state and national elected officials to blast <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION>' British parent, <ORGANIZATION> BAT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, for maintaining businesses in racially segregated <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. After the deal was cut, <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheehy </PERSON> said the earlier acrimony had n't effected the week-long negotiations. `` I think often things that are said in court are much more acrimonious than one's true feelings,'' <PERSON> Sheehy </PERSON> said in an interview. One or the other of the companies has challenged or threatened to challenge the seven state regulatory decisions issued to date, some in court and some in appeals to the regulators. By dropping various lawsuits and jointly appealing regulators' decisions, the companies said, officials believe they can clear the regulatory path to a merger as early as the end of the year The merger won the approval of insurance regulators in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, and was given conditional approval in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> have rejected the deal and decisions or hearings are pending in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> regulators rejected the merger, but that decision was overturned by a state court.

 <ORGANIZATION> Insilco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday it accepted a $ 1.1 billion buyout offer from two <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> oilmen, tossing aside a previous takeover agreement with a management-led group. Under the latest arrangement, <ORGANIZATION> INR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, headed by <PERSON> Cyril </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, will pay $ 31.75 in cash for each of <ORGANIZATION> Insilco </ORGANIZATION>'s outstanding 25.6 million shares. Including debt, the deal has an indicated value of about $ 1.1 billion, <ORGANIZATION> Insilco </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. In active trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Insilco </ORGANIZATION> closed up $ 1.12 -LCB- a share Thursday to $ 31.12 -LCB-. Two weeks ago, <ORGANIZATION> Insilco </ORGANIZATION> agreed to a management-led leveraged buyout with <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. But <ORGANIZATION> Insilco </ORGANIZATION>'s board said Thursday that it had withdrawn its support of the $ 29-a-share offer, which valued the company at about $ 950 million. <ORGANIZATION> Dissenting </ORGANIZATION> shareholders last week filed lawsuits against <ORGANIZATION> Insilco </ORGANIZATION>, charging that management's offer was too low. In a leveraged buyout a company is acquired largely through borrowed funds that are repaid through the target company's profits or asset sales. Anaylysts had said higher bids would increase the chance a buyer would have to sell at least some divisions of <ORGANIZATION> Insilco </ORGANIZATION> to finance the purchase. Once a leading silver operation known as <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Silver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Insilco </ORGANIZATION> restructured itself into an industrial holding company and producer of specialty consumer and high technology products. Several subsidiaries have wide brand-name recognition, including Rolodex desktop equipment, <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Devil </ORGANIZATION> paints and <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> school yearbooks. <ORGANIZATION> Insilco </ORGANIZATION> reported a flat overall earnings for the first half of 1988, $ 21.7 million, or $ 1.02 a share, vs. $ 21.5 million, or $ 1.02, a year ago. But its profit from ongoing operations increased about 11 percent and sales rose almost 21 percent. <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> and <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> are engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas, the operation of gas pipelines, real estate development and other businesses. Earlier this year, the pair launched a hostile tender offer for <ORGANIZATION> USG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a Chicago-based building products concern. But <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> and <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> terminated their offer in June, a month after they lost a bid for six seats on <ORGANIZATION> USG </ORGANIZATION>'s board in a heated proxy contest. To finance the <ORGANIZATION> Insilco </ORGANIZATION> acquisition, <ORGANIZATION> INR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> said it has obtained commitments totaling $ 980 million from <LOCATION> Wagner </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co. The deal received the unanimous endorsement of a special committee of outside directors, <ORGANIZATION> Insilco </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> INR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> will begin a cash tender offer within five business days of the execution of a definitive merger agreement.

 In the latest round of higher interest rates worldwide, the central banks of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and several other European countries hiked their key rates Thursday. The actions rekindled fears of a global interest-rate spiral and unnerved financial markets. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, up 37.34 points on Wednesday, dropped 15.82 to 2,010.85. The European interest-rate hikes also had the intended effect of knocking the dollar lower, especially against the West German mark. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency was quoted at around 1.8645 marks in late afternoon trading in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, down sharply from 1.8820 marks late Wednesday. Some analysts believe the rate hikes by <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> and other European central banks could prompt another sharp tightening of credit in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ where the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> pushed rates higher only a few weeks ago `` There's some danger that we could get'' an increase in the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s discount rate, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Brusca </PERSON>, chief economist for investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` The dollar is really looking like it's made a turn for the worse. Other experts, however, deem it unlikely that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> would take such dramatic action again to raise rates so close to the presidential election in November. Instead, they expect the central bank to nudge rates gently higher by using its routine operations in the money markets _ even if inflationary pressures heat up and the dollar slumps. `` The farther we get along on this process of leapfrogging -LRB- interest rates -RRB-, the more reluctance starts to grow,'' said <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a senior vice president of <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Albany </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` In some ways, it's like a poker game and everyone starts raising the ante _ and some people start dropping out.'' In a surprise move Aug. 9, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> central bank announced a half-percentage point increase in its discount rate to combat inflation. That put the fee the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> charges member banks for short-term loans at 6.5 percent, its highest level in more than two years. It was the first rise in the key rate since September 1987 _ the month preceding the stock market crash _ and sparked a half-point increase in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> prime lending rate to 10 percent. After the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> increase, many market watchers believed it was only a matter of time before the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' major trading partners responded in kind. `` We had been more or less anticipating'' a European rate rise, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Redding </PERSON>, an international economist for <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` It's more of a catch-up on the part of the foreigners.'' The Bank of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> signaled a full percentage point increase in the British commercial banks' base lending rate to 12 percent, following a government report on the country's trade deficit in July. The report showed <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s July trade gap soared 72 percent to a record 2.65 billion pounds, or about $ 4.5 billion. British Chancellor of the Exchequer <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> said the rate was boosted to keep inflation under control. The <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> raised its discount rate to 3.5 percent from 3 percent, citing the dollar's recent strength against the mark. The central banks of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> quickly followed suit with rate hikes. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, however, a senior <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> official said there is `` absolutely no need to consider an adjustment in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s monetary policy just because the <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> raised their base rates.'' While the increases may have been foreseen, experts did find surprising the ferocity of the West Germans' verbal attack on the dollar. <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> <PERSON> Poehl </PERSON> said the bank will `` continue to do everything to stem the decline of the mark against the dollar.'' <PERSON> Poehl </PERSON>'s strident remarks seemed to overreach the February 1987 `` Louvre'' agreement on the value of the dollar informally adopted by the major industrial countries, <PERSON> Redding </PERSON> suggested. `` It makes you wonder about the coordination,'' he said. He noted contrasting statements recently by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials indicating that the dollar could rise a bit more before its advance would need to be stemmed.

<TEXT>
 The dollar fell Thursday in heavy trading sparked by a round of interest rate increases in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and a tough statement from the head of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s central bank. Gold prices were mixed. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> said gold was bid at $ 432.60 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, down from $ 434.60 an ounce late Wednesday. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> raised its discount rate by half a percentage point to 3.5 percent to defend the value of the mark and guard against the inflation that comes from having a weak currency. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> also raised official rates, and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> signaled an increase in commercial rates. In a strongly worded statement, <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> <PERSON> Poehl </PERSON> said the central bank `` will continue to do everything to stem the decline of the Deutsche mark against the dollar.'' <PERSON> Poehl </PERSON> said exchange rates had gotten out of line with those agreed upon by the Group of Seven major industrialized nations and added that `` it's not in the mutual interest if the current trend continues.'' The West German central bank continued to sell dollars in the open market. `` The Germans have shown us pretty clearly that they really have n't been happy with the mark at the level it's been,'' said <PERSON> Derek </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, an economist at <ORGANIZATION> Midland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. Higher European rates make it more attractive to hold securities denominated in the <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> currencies. But the dollar found some support from news that the second quarter <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> gross national product was revised upward to 3.3 percent growth from 3.1 percent. Traders said that the strong growth indicates that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates may rise to match Thursday's increases in European rates. The dollar fell most sharply against the West German mark, sinking to 1.8657 in late <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> trading after briefly touching as low as 1.8575. It closed at 1.8820 Wednesday and 1.9128 Tuesday, meaning its two-day decline was about 2.5 percent. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the pound rose to $ 1.6995 from Wednesday's late $ 1.6788. Later in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the pound rose to $ 1.6965 from $ 1.6869 late Wednesday. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where the business day ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s begins, the dollar fell 0.54 yen to a closing 133.76 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 133.30 yen. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the dollar fell to 133.44 yen from 133.83 yen late Wednesday. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late Wednesday's rates, included: 1.5705 Swiss francs, down from 1.5855; 1.2360 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2339; 6.3413 French francs, down from 6.3960; 1,385.00 Italian lire, down from 1,396.50. Late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Wednesday's rates: 1.8630 West German marks, down from 1.8915; 1.5715 Swiss francs, down from 1.5950; 6.3275 French francs, down from 6.4250; 2.1030 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1370; 1,384.13 Italian lire, down from 1,403.50; and 1.2342 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2321 In <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold rose $ 2.10 a troy ounce to close at a bid $ 436.10. Gold fell in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a late bid price of $ 433.50 an ounce, compared with Wednesday's late bid of $ 433.90. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, gold closed at a bid of $ 433.50 an ounce, unchanged from late Wednesday's bid. On the Commodity Exchange in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, gold bullion for current delivery fell to $ 432.80 a troy ounce from $ 434.90 late Wednesday. Silver bullion prices fell on the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> market. Silver was trading at a late bid price of $ 6.77 a troy ounce, compared with Wednesday's $ 6.81. On <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Comex, silver bullion for current delivery fell to $ 6.708 a troy ounce from $ 6.782 an ounce late Wednesday.

<HEAD>Stocks Retreat on First Anniversary of Dow Jones Industrial Peak</HEAD>

 The stock market retreated in sluggish trading Thursday, as concerns about rising interest rates resurfaced on the first anniversary of the all-time peak in the Dow Jones industrial average. `` People's attitudes are not as positive as they were a year ago,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Garry </PERSON>, manager of institutional trading at the brokerage <ORGANIZATION> Butcher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Singer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. A round of interest rate increases overseas and a new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic report that contained an upward revision in one measure of inflation for the second quarter were cited by analysts as reason for the price slide. They said the combination stirred worries that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates could be headed higher, making returns on <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> securities more competitive with those expected from stocks. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which climbed 37.34 on Wednesday, lost 15.82 to close at 2,010.85. One year ago, the market's best-known barometer had closed at 2,722.42, its record high. Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 2 to 1 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 453 issues up, 998 down and 501 unchanged. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> index fell 0.99 to 146.94. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> came to 127.64 million shares, compared with 127.80 million in the previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trading at regional exchanges and on the over-the-counter market, totaled 148.23 million shares. The market opened lower and the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average extended its decline through midafternoon. The blue-chip index was off 26.31 points at 2 p.m. before recovering some lost ground in the last two hours of the session. Before the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stock market opened, the West German central bank raised a key lending rate and banks in several other European countries followed suit. Also in advance of the opening, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> revised upward its estimate of second-quarter economic growth to 3.3 percent from 3.1 percent, and simultaneously boosted its estimate of an inflation measure tied to the gross national product to show a rise of 5.1 percent, up from 4.1 percent. Analysts said the combination of European rate hikes and the revised inflation estimate stirred speculation that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> rates could be headed higher. Investors expect that if the economy continues to expand rapidly and inflation rises, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> may encourage higher interest rates. Prices in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bond market slipped Thursday, nudging rates up. The 30-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bond, for instance, lost about $ 5 for every $ 1,000 in face value, while its yield rose to 9.45 percent from 9.40 percent Wednesday. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Helfand </PERSON>, manager of retail sales at <ORGANIZATION> Rodman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Renshaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, said the rising rates were offering `` some stiff competition for the stock market.'' He noted that yields on one-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills are above 8.2 percent, and are proving attractive for investors looking for a haven for their money in a volatile financial climate. `` We wo n't make much headway until there is a sign that higher interest rates have begun to slow the economy,'' he said. Butcher & amp; Singer's <PERSON> Garry </PERSON> said he expects trading to remain sluggish until after the Labor Day holiday. `` We are in a drifting pattern,'' he said. Northeast Utilities was the most active issue on the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> with more than 12.1 million shares traded. It fell \ to 18 -RCB-. Friday is the deadline to qualify for the company's quarterly dividend. <ORGANIZATION> Insilco </ORGANIZATION> rose 1 -LRB- to 31 -LRB-. The company's board approved a $ 31.75-a-share buyout offer from two <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> oilmen. Among active blue-chip issues, <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> fell 1 -LRB- to 111 |, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> slipped \ to 45 -RCB-, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> fell | to 28 -LRB- and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> edged up -LRB- to 40 -LRB- In over-the-counter trading, <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> rose -RCB- to 70. The company agreed to a $ 75-a-share takeover offer from B.A.T. Industries of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, but some obstacles remain to completing the deal. The Wilshire Associates Equity Index, the market value of <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>, American and OTC issues, fell $ 16.52 billion, or 0.63 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's industrial index fell 2.14 to 297.36, and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P's 500-stock composite index was off 1.95 to 259.18. At the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the market value index fell 0.85 to 293.21. The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market fell 1.99 to 374.04.

 The two broadest measures of the nation's money supply fell in the week ended Aug. 15, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said the measure known as M2 fell to a seasonally adjusted $ 3,027.5 billion in that week, from $ 3,028.2 billion the previous week. An even broader measure, M3, fell to 3,823.4 billion from $ 3,825.2 billion. The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, fell to $ 780 billion from $ 782 billion the previous week. M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts such as savings deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations of $ 100,000. In judging monetary policy, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has indicated it is monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the difference between short - and long-term interest rates It also has shifted attention from M1 to the two broader money supply measures For the latest 13 weeks, M1 averaged $ 778.1 billion, a 6.4 percent rate of gain from the previous 13 weeks, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said, although it has not set a specific target range for that figure since early last year.

<HEAD>Petroleum Futures Hurt by Reports of Overproduction, Iran-Iraq
Squabbling</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES LITKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Petroleum futures prices fell broadly Thursday, plunging sharply at times amid reports of overproduction by <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> and renewed saber-rattling between member nations <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. `` Instead of fighting on the battlefield, they seem to want to fight in the press,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritterbusch </PERSON>, vice president of trading and research for <ORGANIZATION> Carson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in suburban <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` And all that posturing just makes people nervous.'' In other markets, copper futures prices extended recent gains as demand remained strong, platinum joined gold and silver in a precious metal decline, cocoa futures continued plunging, and grain futures prices were mixed while soybeans were mostly higher. Petroleum futures came under pressure at the opening and moved steadily lower as the market absorbed its first blow when a report pegged production by members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries at between 19 million and 20 million barrels. A second blow came later in the day as Iranian oil minister <PERSON> Khazempour </PERSON> <PERSON> Ardbelli </PERSON> was quoted as saying his nation would refuse any attempt to allot <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> to the same 2.36 million barrel-per-day share of <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> production granted <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has been outside <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> production quotas since 1986, when it claimed the economic drain of the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> necessitated the extra production. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s current output is estimated at 2.6 million barrels per day. `` <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> calls <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> ` obstructionist' and it makes some people edgy,'' said <PERSON> Ritterbusch </PERSON>. Crude oil prices on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> settled 34 to 41 cents lower, with the contract for delivery in October at $ 15.31 per barrel; heating oil was 1.17 cents to 1.30 cents lower, with September at 42.45 cents a gallon; and unleaded gasoline was 1 cent to 1.10 cents lower with September at 46.44 cents a gallon. Copper futures, meanwhile, were .55 cent to 1.65 cents higher at the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with August at 102.35 cents a pound. But the precious metals, which made some gains Wednesday, retrenched Thursday. Platinum futures on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> slipped $ 3.50 to $ 6.20, with October at $ 547.70 a troy ounce. At the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, gold dropped $ 2 to $ 2.20, with August at $ 432.80 a troy ounce; silver lost 7.4 cents to 7.7 cents, with August at 670.8 cents a troy ounce. Cocoa futures took another beating as traders, already unnerved by the size of the worldwide surplus, left the market after rumors that the <LOCATION> Ivory </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, the world's leading producer, was back selling after a long absence. `` People who held long positions just bailed out because they are n't seeing any turnaround,'' said <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevenson </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` The <LOCATION> Ivory </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> rumors, if true, would be very, very negative.'' Cocoa futures settled $ 33 to $ 45 lower on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coffee </ORGANIZATION>, Sugar and <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with September at $ 1,303 per ton. Grain futures prices were mixed while soybeans were mostly higher at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. On the close, wheat was 2 \ cents to 4 cents higher, with the contract for delivery in September at $ 3.93 a bushel; corn was 4 cents lower to 2 -RCB- cents higher, with September at $ 2.80 -RCB- a bushel; oats were unchanged to 1 cent lower, with September at $ 2.54; and soybeans were 5 cents lower to 5 \ cents higher, with September at $ 8.35 -LCB- a Livestock and meat futures finished mixed to mostly higher at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle settled .02 cent lower .80 cent higher, with October at 72.10 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .83 cent higher, with August at 81.80 cents a pound; live hogs were .10 cent lower to .62 cent higher, with October at 40.85 cents a pound; and frozen pork bellies were .60 cent to 1.20 cents higher, with February at 55.15 cents a pound.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Skid on GNP Report, Overseas Interest Rate Hikes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Bond prices slumped Thursday after a round of interest rate hikes overseas and a government report that inflation accelerated during the second quarter. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s bellwether 30-year bond fell 17-32 point, or about $ 5.30 for every $ 1,000 in face amount. Its yield, which moves inversely to its price and is an indicator of interest rate trends, rose to 9.45 percent from 9.40 percent late Wednesday. The central banks of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and several other European countries raised key interest rates Thursday in response to the dollar's recent strength. The coordinated steps pushed the dollar downward, and set a negative tone as trading opened in the bond market, said <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reiners </PERSON>, vice president for money market research at the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> recently raised its discount rate, the interest it charges its member banks, and traders feared the overseas rate hikes might prompt the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> to increase the rate again. That would force bond prices lower. The bond market was dealt a bigger blow, however, when the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> issued its revised gross national product figures for the second quarter. The department said the economy expanded at a robust annual rate of 3.3 percent from April through June despite the severe impact of the drought on farm production. That was up from an earlier estimate of 3.1 percent. What hurt bonds was a GNP price index, which rose at an annual rate of 5.1 percent during the quarter, the sharpest increase since a 5.8 percent rise in the third quarter of 1982. The 30-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> issue fell nearly a point on the news, Mrs. <PERSON> Reiners </PERSON> said. The market has been sensitive to reports about inflation because the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> has tightened credit in an attempt at keeping inflation in check. Prices recovered, however, as traders had second thoughts about the GNP report, Mrs. <PERSON> Reiners </PERSON> said. `` Most people realize it's second quarter data, only through June,'' she said. And with the recent interest rate hikes in this country, `` possibly there'll be some abatement in the economy,'' she said. In the secondary market for <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> securities, prices of short-term government issues were -LRB- point to 7-32 point lower, intermediate maturities ranged 9-32 point to -RRB- point lower, and 20-year issues were 13-32 point lower, according to figures provided by <ORGANIZATION> Telerate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a financial information service. The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $ 10 in the price of a bond with a $ 1,000 face value. The <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Bond Index, which measures price movements on all outstanding <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> issues with maturities of a year or longer, fell 2.66 to 1,123.07. Corporate bonds also were down. <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>'s Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, was down 0.60 to 281.51. Municipal bonds slipped as well. The Bond Buyer Municipal Bond Index slipped 7-32 point to 88 16-32, while its yield rose to 8.16 percent from late Wednesday's 8.14 percent. Yields on <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills moved higher. Three-month bills rose 3 basis points to a discounted rate of 7.28 percent and a yield of 7.51 percent. Six-month bills were up 3 basis points to a discounted rate of 7.48 percent to yield 7.87 percent, and one-year bills rose 4 basis points to a discounted rate of 7.71 percent and a yield of 8.27 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the annualized return on an investment in a <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bill. The discounted rate is the interest rate the market uses to price bills. The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was quoted at 8 \ percent, up from 7 13-16 percent late Wednesday

 A prominent <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> entrepreneur and the former president of The <ORGANIZATION> Seven-Up </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> each were sentenced to the maximum three years in prison and fined $ 100,000 Thursday for their part in a price-fixing conspiracy. <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lapides </PERSON>, 57, chairman of the board of <ORGANIZATION> Alleghany </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beverage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Cheverly </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Harford </PERSON>, former president of <LOCATION> Mid-Atlantic </LOCATION> Coca-Cola Bottling of Silver Spring, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, were convicted in May following a six-week trial. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Doumar </PERSON> suspended all but 179 days of <PERSON> Lapides </PERSON>' sentence and all but six months of <PERSON> Harford </PERSON>'s sentence. <PERSON> Doumar </PERSON> also placed both men on three years' probation after the completion of their sentence, with each required to perform community service during that period. <PERSON> Harford </PERSON> has appealed his conviction and <PERSON> Lapides </PERSON> is expected to do so. The federal jury had found that <PERSON> Harford </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Alleghany </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bottling </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Lapides </PERSON>, as head of <ORGANIZATION> Alleghany </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bottling </ORGANIZATION>'s parent company, conspired to fix the wholesale price of <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi-Cola </ORGANIZATION> products. Sentencing for the corporation will continue Friday, and <PERSON> Doumar </PERSON> said proceedings could take several days. When convicted, <PERSON> Harford </PERSON> was the president of <ORGANIZATION> Seven-Up </ORGANIZATION>, but resigned that post three days later. <PERSON> Harford </PERSON>'s conviction was the result of actions while heading the <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> bottling firm and did not involve Seven-Up. The convictions were part of an on-going <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> probe of the soft drink industry, which has resulted in 11 grand jury investigations in eight other states. <PERSON> Lapides </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harford </PERSON> were convicted of rigging the wholesale price of their respective products in 1983 and 1984. <ORGANIZATION> Alleghany </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beverage </ORGANIZATION> was the parent company of <ORGANIZATION> Alleghany </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi-Cola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bottling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> until 1985 when <PERSON> Lapides </PERSON> sold the subsidiary for $ 160 million. During the trial, the defense contended neither man knew of the scheme and that if the allegations were true it was the work of lower level employees who made decisions without their bosses' knowledge Federal prosecutors argued the two bottlers reached an accord to halt the previous bitter competition by fixing the wholesale price of their products sold to schools, motels, hotels, and other commercial buyers in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Mid-Atlantic </LOCATION> pleaded guilty to earlier, similar indictments and agreed to pay $ 2 million in fines for price rigging in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, markets. In March, both bottling firms also agreed to rebate $ 45,000 to <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> to be distributed to school districts for overcharges on their soft drink purchases. The agreement drawn up by Attorney General <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> called for <LOCATION> Mid-Atlantic </LOCATION> to pay $ 30,000 and <ORGANIZATION> Alleghany </ORGANIZATION> $ 15,000. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> had argued <PERSON> Harford </PERSON> be given the maximum sentence because `` he is the highest culpable official at <LOCATION> Mid-Atlantic </LOCATION>. `` We should not allow this case with such tremendous damage to the public to be a source of cynicism to the public'' by giving <PERSON> Harford </PERSON> a light sentence, he said. During the hearing, <PERSON> Doumar </PERSON> said he had received numerous letters from friends, relatives and business associates on <PERSON> Harford </PERSON>'s outstanding achievements in the community In his sentencing, the judge commended <PERSON> Harford </PERSON> for his work in the community, and for his persistent urging of <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> to become more involved. `` Your company did a lot of good for the community through your urgings, but you were being charitible to the public with money you took from the public,'' he said. Prior to the conviction, several other soft drink executives have been found guilty or pleaded guilty to a variety of charges. In February 1987, <PERSON> Armand </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gravely </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> division manager for <ORGANIZATION> Alleghany </ORGANIZATION>, was convicted of price fixing and obstruction of justice. He was sentenced to four months in jail and fined $ 15,000. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wynns </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Mid-Atlantic </LOCATION> vice president, pleaded guilty in May 1987 to charges he lied to the grand jury investigating the price fixing. The former president of <ORGANIZATION> Alleghany </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bottling </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheridan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Timonium </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, was given a 3-year sentence, with all but 120 days suspended, and fined $ 45,000 in August 1987 after pleading guilty to price fixing. A third executive indicted along with <PERSON> Lapides </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harford </PERSON>, <PERSON> Odis </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Mid-Atlantic </LOCATION> vice president, pleaded guilty to price fixing in March.

 Sales of existing single-family homes, jolted by rising mortgage rates, dropped 5 percent in July, the first decline since January, a real estate trade group said Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION> said that sales of existing homes dropped to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.63 million units last month, following a 6.4 percent increase in June. The decline was the first since a 4.8 percent drop in January with analysts blaming the setback on rising mortgage rates. Fixed-rate mortgages climbed to a nationwide average of 10.5 percent at the end of July and have risen even faster in August, topping 10.71 percent last week. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuccillo </PERSON>, chief economist for the Realtors, said even with the July drop in demand, sales were still at the second highest monthly level of the past year. `` Even with the recent and prospective increases in interest rates, sales in 1988 will almost certainly be higher than we anticipated at the beginning of the year,'' he said. The median price of a home rose from June to July by $ 1,400 to $ 91,600, up 3.7 percent from a year ago, when the median sales price for an existing home was $ 88,300. For the first time in a decade, the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> led in year-over-year price changes, with an increase of 7 percent to a median price of $ 70,600. The Northeast remained the highest-priced region of the country, with a median price of $ 146,700 last month, up just 0.6 percent from a year ago. The median price in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> was $ 123,500 last month, 4.2 percent higher than a year ago, while the median price in the South of $ 85,600 was 5.7 percent higher than a year ago. <PERSON> Tuccillo </PERSON> said that the big jump in home prices in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> reflected a rebound in the region's rust belt industries because of the boom in manufacturing caused by rising export sales. He said the smaller price increase for the <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> reflected some softening in demand after two years of strong sales. All regions of the country except the West suffered sales declines in July. The sharpest decline occurred in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, where sales were down 7 percent in July to an annual rate of 1.32 million units. In the Northeast sales dropped 6.8 percent to an annual rate of 690,000 units while sales in the Midwest fell by 5.1 percent in July, compared to June, but were 4.4 percent higher than a year ago. The West saw sales rise 3.2 percent to an annual rate of 690,000 units in July.

<HEAD>Expert: Recent Rains Limit Damage To Christmas Tree Industry</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Recent rains have <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> tree growers dreaming of a green Christmas. The drought killed more than 10 million seedlings in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, but the rains should help keep Christmas tree prices about the same as last year, said <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Koelling </PERSON>, a forestry professor at <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` From the consumer standpoint, I do n't expect a change in quality, quantity or price this year,'' <PERSON> Koelling </PERSON> said Thursday. `` Retailers should n't use the drought as justification for price increases.'' <PERSON> Koelling </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> is the nation's biggest producer of Christmas trees, followed by <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> produced 55 million Christmas trees in 1987, and should be at or above that level this year, depending on demand. Millions of trees have been spared from drought damage since rains began in mid-July, <PERSON> Koelling </PERSON> said. `` Those rains came exactly when they had to come,'' <PERSON> Koelling </PERSON> said. `` We would have lost a significant number of large trees without the rains.'' Many trees up to 6 years old died, he said. Most Christmas trees are harvested after about 10 years' growth. Scotch pines, the mainstay of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s Christmas tree crop, have fared better than fir trees, <PERSON> Koelling </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Woodworkers Union Ratifies Simpson Pact</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Woodworkers at three <ORGANIZATION> Simpson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Timber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> mills in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> have ratified a new labor agreement, ending a strike that began June 24, union leaders said Thursday. The agreement covering 1,300 workers is similar to contracts ratified earlier by woodworkers at <ORGANIZATION> Willamette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Boise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cascade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, making <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> the region's third timber company to end a summer walkout by settling with its union. <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Macrae </PERSON>, a vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Woodworkers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America-U.S. </ORGANIZATION>, said picket lines came down immediately after the vote was counted Thursday. The 800 <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> employees at <LOCATION> Shelton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, and 500 at northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> mills at <LOCATION> Arcata </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Korbel </PERSON> will begin returning to work immediately, said <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartley </PERSON>. Like the Willamette and <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION> settlements, the <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> deal includes a $ 1,400 signing bonus, plus wage increases of 3 percent next year, 4 percent in 1990 and 4 percent in 1991. <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> woodworkers also got a new productivity-based incentive plan. <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>'s logging crews have had successful productivity incentive plans for two years, <PERSON> Hartley </PERSON> said. The <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> walkout was part of a larger regional timber strike that began June 6 and eventually affected about 7,900 workers in five states. About 3,400 workers remain on strike at mills operated by <ORGANIZATION> Champion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> DAW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> WI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Lakeview </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lumber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>. As negotiations began this year, workers demanded restoration of wages and benefits cut two years ago when the companies were struggling to get out of an industry-wide recession The industry wanted to limit raises to bonuses, avoiding costly increases in basic wage rates. Champion International officials say local issues have been resolved at all but two of their six struck Pacific Northwest plants. Once the local issues are settled, <ORGANIZATION> Champion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> representatives want to meet with union leaders to negotiate remaining economic issues, they said Wednesday. Some 2,400 Champion workers have been affected by the strike, including 450 at a plant in <LOCATION> Roseburg </LOCATION>. Results still are pending from ratification votes being taken this week on tentative agreements affecting 1,200 non-striking workers at <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> mills in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Union leaders expected to complete the <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION> tally by Monday.
