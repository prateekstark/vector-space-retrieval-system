<TEXT>
 Tropical Storm <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> strengthened into a hurricane Saturday night in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>, boasting maximum sustained winds of nearly 75 mph, forecasters said. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> was expected drop 5 to 10 inches of rain on <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> by Sunday, the National Hurricane Center said. At 10:30 p.m. EDT Saturday, <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> was centered 225 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Santo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Domingo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. It was near latitude 16.0 north, longitude 67.3 west. Forecasters expected the storm to continue to strengthen. `` The system is becoming better organized,'' said <PERSON> Lixion </PERSON> <PERSON> Avila </PERSON>, hurricane center meteorologist. `` The convection is becoming concentrated in the center.'' The storm was expected to continue moving west at near 15 mph for the next 24 hours. The government of the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> issued a hurricane warning for the <PERSON> Barahona </PERSON> peninsula. Two weeks ago, a depression that later became Tropical Storm <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> dumped 6.6 inches of rain on <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, causing mudslides and flooding blamed for three deaths and damage to more than 100 homes. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> came ashore Aug. 28 at <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, destroying more than a dozen mobile homes, killing one person, and leaving thousands temporarily without power before losing steam over land. Meanwhile, the remnants of hurricane <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION> moved into <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> on Saturday while thousands of evacuated <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> residents returned to their homes. Most found little damage from the storm's 80 mph wind. Officials blamed <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION> for one death.

 A black bear and a mule deer buck are the first large animals confirmed killed by the forest fires in and near <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, and firefighters have been warned to avoid any injured animals. Yellowstone National Park officials had repeatedly said that larger animals such as deer, elk, bison and bear can easily sidestep fires that advance normally. However, fires in the <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> area have not behaved normally. Veteran firefighters in and around the park say they have never seen fire move so far, so quickly. The black bear was suffering from deep burns on its feet and was unable to do more than lift its head Friday evening, said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Safford </PERSON>, a highway patrolman who was given permission by state and local officials to shoot and kill the suffering animal about a half mile east of Silver Gate. `` All four pads were burned off the feet and down to the bone. He must have run through a bunch of hot coals. It looked to me like he would have been permanently immobile,'' <PERSON> Safford </PERSON> said. The bear, about 4 years old, had been seen lying in a marsh about 200 yards above a highway for about 24 hours before it was killed. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Folenius </PERSON>, safety officer on the Storm Creek fire, told firefighters at Saturday's 6 a.m. briefing that there had been sightings of some hurt bears and cautioned firefighters to be careful around them if they were spotted. About seven miles west of where the bear was killed, the charred carcass of a mature buck deer lay beside the road to <LOCATION> Daisy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pass </LOCATION>. Fire scoured the area Wednesday. Another carcass was reported to be nearby, but could not be located.

 A Burmese rebel leader was quoted today as saying his group would provide military support to student protesters if fighting broke out with the armed forces in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Brang </PERSON> <PERSON> Seng </PERSON> said the support would include weapons, training and sanctuary if needed, according to a report in the English-language <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> Standard. <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> has been wracked by weeks of unrest. Students have led demonstrations seeking to replace one-party rule with a democratic government. In the <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> capital of <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> today, the ruling party announced it would end its 26-year monopoly on power and hold general elections under a multiparty system. The newspaper said <LOCATION> Brang </LOCATION> Seng, a key figure in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, had predicted today's action in an interview in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> earlier this week. `` The fact is that they have to abdicate, to leave, to relinquish,'' he was quoted as saying. He said the <ORGANIZATION> Burma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> could not stay in power much longer. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> is an alliance of 10 rebel groups, all ethnic minorities, fighting the <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> government. <PERSON> Brang </PERSON> <PERSON> Seng </PERSON> told the Standard that the front had adopted a `` wait and see'' attitude as anti-government demonstrations swept the country. But he said student leaders had been promised support from the rebels. `` We will provide provisions, we will accept them in areas that are totally liberated by us, and we will, if the need arises, train and equip them to be ready for that eventuality -LRB- of military confrontation -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Brang </PERSON> <PERSON> Seng </PERSON> was quoted as saying.

<HEAD>Sale of Satellites to China Seen Harming U.S. Security, Space

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 If the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration wins final approval of its plan to allow <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to launch U.S.-made communications satellites, national security will be damaged and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commercial space industry will be `` cut off at the knees,'' a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> congressman says. Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., whose district includes the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> space launch center at <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION>, told reporters that chances to overturn the decision in the few remaining days of the 100th <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are `` very slim. `` We'll give it the old college try, but it will be very difficult to beat them back,'' <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said. Friday's announcement represented a victory for the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which overrode contentions by the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and private industry that the deal will place <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> producers of satellite launchers at a competitive disadvantage. The plan was denounced by <ORGANIZATION> Martin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marietta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which makes rockets for commercial use. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said the transaction is the first of its kind involving a `` non-Western'' destination. Another official, speaking only on condition of anonymity, said President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> made the final decision because of the inter-agency conflict. The transaction is subject to approval by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and by a group of Western allies that monitor high-technology transfers. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said he believes national security will be damaged if the deal goes through because `` when we allow them to integrate one of the most sophisticated satellites known to planet <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> onto a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> rocket we have just given away a great part of the American advantage.'' He said the sale will enable the Chinese to learn technology in which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has the world's leading edge. `` We're giving away American jobs and the technology needed to keep those jobs,'' the congressman asserted. `` The nation is ill served by this decision because it cuts the fledgling American rocket industry off at the knees.'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said a license application was submitted by <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> for the Chinese launch of two of its satellites which have been ordered by an Australian consortium, <ORGANIZATION> AUSSAT </ORGANIZATION>. He also announced the conditional approval of a license for the launch of a third U.S.-made satellite on a Chinese launch vehicle. Known as AsiaSat, the satellite will be launched on behalf of a <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong-based </LOCATION> consortium with Chinese and British ownership. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said that in reaching its decision, the administration was trying to assure the ability of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commercial launch industry `` to compete on an equal footing with launches from a non-market economy, while continuing to promote increased U.S.-China trade.''

<HEAD>Postal Window Service Restored</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Postal Service today is restoring the window services it cut last February in a move that saved $ 40 million and helped cushion an expected $ 500 million deficit this year for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mail system. Hours at post offices wo n't necessarily be the same as before the cuts were imposed, however, with local managers allowed to make changes that they think best serve their customers. Ordered by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to cut out $ 160 million in spending, the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> made a series of changes, including reducing window hours at most offices by a half-day per week. The reduction in hours drew heavy criticism, coming just two months before postage rates were increased. Postmaster General <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> has struggled to explain that the two events were not related. The rate increase was in response to a rising deficit, and had been in the works for more than a year. The service cuts were necessitated when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> unexpectedly ordered the spending reduction. It was part of an effort to reduce the overall federal budget, even though the post office no longer receives a taxpayer subsidy. In restoring the window hours, local managers were given the option to adjust hours to suit the needs of their communities. For example, Saturday hours will not be restored in heavily Jewish sections of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, where little business was done on that day anyway because of the sabbath. Instead, managers will experiment with staying open later some days or perhaps having some Sunday office hours. In other areas, instead of extending hours overall, managers will add more clerks to handle business during peak times. While the hours of window clerk service are returning, other money-saving cuts imposed in February remain in effect, including curtailment of Sunday mail collection and sorting and a moratorium on construction of new post offices. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, is considering bills to remove the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> from the federal budget as a way to avoid similar service reductions in the future. The window closings saved about $ 40 million, officials reported. Unless action is taken, the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> faces another $ 270 million in spending cuts in the fiscal year that starts Oct. 1. That will not mean that hours will be cut again, however. Postal managers say they have found ways to cut spending _ although at the cost of slower service _ by such things as switching some mail from airplanes to trucks, changing trucking schedules, reducing management travel and training spending and cutting research and development. The <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> expects to finish the current fiscal year at the end of this month with a deficit of between $ 500 million and $ 550 million. Higher postage rates which took effect April 4 are expected to help boost the agency into the black in fiscal 1989, however. The <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> has managed to break even over the last decade, losing money in some years and showing a surplus in others.

 Small spenders were out in force for the final day of an auction of <PERSON> Elton </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON>'s belongings, purchasing the rock star's soap dish, chamber pot and even the posters advertising the sale. The sale, which ended Friday, reaped a total of $ 8.17 million. `` A lot of this stuff was cheap, and small private buyers could afford it,'' said <PERSON> Fiona </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <PERSON> Sotheby </PERSON>'s auction house. `` Lots of them were <PERSON> Elton </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> fans.'' The sale started Tuesday and consisted of 1,922 lots, including <PERSON> Rembrandt </PERSON> etchings, an umbrella with a large `` E'' for the handle, a replica of Egyptian <PERSON> Pharoah </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutankhamun </PERSON>'s throne, and the singer's stilt-like boots from the 1975 film `` <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Sotheby </PERSON>'s had expected the sale to bring in $ 5 million. Ms. <PERSON> James </PERSON> said the final two days brought in $ 2.63 million, but she could not provide a figure for Friday alone. Small and unusual items went on the block Friday, Ms. <PERSON> James </PERSON> said. Among them were a pair of silver Cartier bowls, one of which <PERSON> John </PERSON> used as a soap dish in his bathroom. They sold for about $ 1,030. A chamber pot fetched $ 270. One American fan paid about $ 930 for the plastic banners advertising the sale. <PERSON> John </PERSON>'s cassette-tape player, in a miniature grand piano, sold for $ 1,765 while a penny-operated amusement machine fetched $ 820. Top prices went to statuettes by the French artist <PERSON> Erte </PERSON>. One, of a woman holding a globe, sold for $ 14,315, almost five times the expected price. <PERSON> John </PERSON>, 41, has said he wants to make room in his mansion near <LOCATION> Windsor </LOCATION>, west of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, to start new collections. <PERSON> Sotheby </PERSON>'s said he kept up with the auction proceedings by telephone from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>New Effort To Amend Medicaid Abortion Rules Seems Doomed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The first attempt to liberalize Medicaid abortion restrictions in seven years appears doomed to failure in the wake of a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> vote to continue paying for abortions only when a woman's life is endangered. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted 216-166 Friday to stand by existing policy rather than go along with a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> plan to permit government-financed abortions for poor victims of rape and incest. The abortion controversy arose in connection with a $ 140 billion spending bill for the departments of labor, education and health and human services that also included funds for AIDS and student financial aid. House and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiators came to agreement on every other element of the massive fiscal 1989 appropriations bill, but were stymied on abortion. The House action added to mounting pressure on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to back off its amendment. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has said repeatedly he would veto the entire spending bill if abortion policy is liberalized. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> could act on the bill and the abortion question as early as Monday, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, indicated `` We are disappointed but not defeated,'' said <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> Michelman </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abortion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, in a statement after the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> vote. Apparently anticipating a similar setback in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, she added, `` we shall redouble our efforts with the new <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the new administration and we'll try again.'' Under an amendment authored by Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>., Medicaid pays only for abortions needed to save the life of a woman It had been seven years since either chamber had voted to liberalize the policy until the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> adopted the rape and incest provision on July 27. Specifically, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> measure said Medicaid would pay for abortions in cases of promptly reported rape or incest. States still would have the option of barring payments for all abortions except those necessary to save a woman's life. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, legislative director for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Right-to-Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, issued a statement saying `` the groups pushing for these changes really want to restore federal funding of abortion on demand.'' Much of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> debate centered on the fundamental morality of abortion, despite the narrow focus of the amendment. `` You ca n't avoid injustice in a rape situation. You ca n't avoid injustice in an incest situation. But why compound the injustice by putting on top of it exterminating an innocent human life?'' <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON> said. `` Do n't make us a part of that double tragedy. ... Out of great, great tragedy, some good can come.'' Lawmakers on the other side argued with equal passion that poor women victimized by brutal crimes are entitled to a full range of medical options. `` The consequences to individuals are very substantial,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Steny </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyer </PERSON>, D-Md. `` This is the appropriate and sensitive and humane step for us to take.'' <PERSON> Faye </PERSON> <PERSON> Wattleton </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Planned </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parenthood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, accused the House of treating poor women callously. `` To force a woman to bear her rapist's child because she is poor is the cruelest insult imaginable,'' <PERSON> Wattleton </PERSON> said in a statement. However, some <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON> allies noted that medical procedures are available to prevent conception after rapes or incest. Others said the proposed exceptions would create problems for law enforcement officers confronted with reports of rape. `` What we're going to do is make liars out of women so that they can get an abortion funded by the government,'' contended Rep. <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Volkmer </PERSON>, D-Mo. Before moving to the abortion debate, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted 335-60 to approve the other portions of the three-agency spending bill. The measure includes $ 1.2 billion for AIDS research, treatment, prevention and education; $ 4.3 billion in education grants for disadvantaged students; $ 5.5 billion in college student financial assistance, and $ 3.7 billion for the Job Training Partnership Act.

 <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> has spent 12 years fighting to prove he did n't kill the policeman for whose murder he nearly was executed. The key witness now supports him, and a new movie based on <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' case has prompted petition drives demanding his freedom. `` The Thin Blue Line,'' directed by <PERSON> Errol </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, strongly suggests the wrong man was tried and petitions are circulating in theaters calling for a pardon. <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> District Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> said he is unimpressed by the film, which is now playing in more than 200 cities, and sees no reason to reopen the case. `` Nothing in there convinces me we have the wrong man in jail,'' <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> said this week. However, evidence <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> gathered in nearly three years of investigation, including prosecution witnesses who told him on camera that they lied in <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' 1977 trial, is being used by attorneys to prepare a motion for a new trial. `` The Thin Blue Line'' uses both real interviews with most of the key people in the case and re-enactments of the shooting from the perspectives of different characters. `` I'm not a reporter,'' <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> said, adding he prefers to call the movie a `` non-fiction feature.'' On Nov. 28, 1976, <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, then 27, ran out of gas driving home from work. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, a teen-ager who'd stolen a car and driven to <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, helped <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> get gas and the pair spent the rest of the day drinking and smoking marijuana. That night, <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> policeman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> was shot and killed after he and a partner stopped a car being driven with only its parking lights on. A month later, when police arrested <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> for an unrelated crime in his hometown of <LOCATION> Vidor </LOCATION>, in southeast <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, they learned he had bragged to friends about killing a <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> police officer. But when questioned by <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> police, <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, who had no criminal record. With <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> the star prosecution witness, <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> was convicted of <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>'s slaying in 1977 and sentenced to die in the electric chair. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> received a stay three days before his May 1979 execution date. In 1980, his death sentence was commuted to life in prison after the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled that his trial jury had been improperly selected. The film ends with <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, now on death row himself for another murder, saying <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> did not kill <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>. In recent weeks, <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> made similar statements to <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> news organizations. After <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>' statements appeared in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> newspapers, <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said, `` Maybe now people will start to listen a little closer to what I've been saying for 12 years.'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> has not seen the movie. `` The ball is now in <PERSON> Vance </PERSON>'s court,'' said <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaffer </PERSON>, <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> lawyer. He said he expects to hear within two weeks whether the prosecutor will contest a motion on <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' behalf or seek a pardon from the governor. The motion `` basically has to do with suppression of favorable evidence, perjury by witnesses, favorable documents and reports that were supposed to be turned over to defense that were not,'' said <PERSON> Schaffer </PERSON>. `` And we have evidence with regard to -LRB- <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' -RRB- innocence.'' <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> said, `` It's not unusual for a man on death row to say the things <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> is saying.'' He wo n't say how he'll respond to the motion. Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clements </PERSON> was out of town Friday, but his aide, <PERSON> Knox </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzpatrick </PERSON>, said the office has gotten a number of letters about the case. He would not say what the governor's opinion was of the case. Petitions seeking a pardon initially were distributed by <PERSON> Miramax </PERSON>, the film's distribution company, said <ORGANIZATION> Miramax </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Christina </PERSON> <PERSON> Kounelias </PERSON>. Now the petitions are being handled by an Albany-based group called Solace, a support group for murder victim's families and a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>. There was no immediate tally on how many signatures had been collected. Solace is also spearheading two fund-raisers for <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, one in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> next week and another in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> the following week. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> met <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> while interviewing inmates for another project. Intrigued, he arranged to meet <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, before <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> was arrested and convicted. `` That first night <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> told me that he would never forget the look in that cop's eyes, which was completely to the contrary to what he'd said at the trial, where he said he'd been in the passenger's seat slumped way down,'' <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> said former District Attorney <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> `` provided me with evidence that <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> did not receive a fair trial in 1977, that it was an illegal trial.''

 A man convicted of murdering his 20-year-old daughter asked a judge to confirm his death sentence as soon as possible so he can watch television in his cell, a prison spokesman says. `` Please bring me in and sentence me,'' <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Starr </PERSON>, 47, of <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> <PERSON> Township </PERSON> said in a letter filed with <LOCATION> Allegheny </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Judge <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Manning </PERSON>'s office Friday. `` I thought the jury already sentenced me to death.'' <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> requested the quick action because it will put him in a section of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> where televisions are permitted, according to prison spokesman <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Seiverling </PERSON>. A jury Aug. 23 sentenced <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> to die for the Feb. 19 stabbing death of daughter <PERSON> Wanda </PERSON> <PERSON> Starr </PERSON>, also of <LOCATION> Moon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Township </LOCATION>. The murder occurred after <PERSON> Starr </PERSON>, a former apartment complex manager, confronted his daughter about stolen rent money.

<HEAD>Consumption Of Dogs, Snakes And Worms Continues Despite Ban</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> gourmets continue to enjoy dog stew and Korean Olympic stars have been consuming barrels of snake soup despite government attempts to ban the traditional delicacies during the Summer Games. The government has outlawed sales in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> of dog meat, snake, blood worm soup and other exotic dishes to avoid offending foreigners during the Olympics, which begin Sept. 17. Officials said visitors might be disgusted by the unusual culinary offerings and Koreans would be called barbaric. But the ban has had little or no effect on <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> restaurants or the eating habits of their customers. Dog meat is still a lunchtime favorite in many backstreet eateries. `` Even the government officials eat it. They just tell us not to let foreigners see,'' said one restaurant owner who spoke on condition of anonymity. `` The number of customers for dog has not dwindled. Not at all,'' he said with a big smile. Korean athletes training for the Olympics have been eating dog, snakes and deer antlers to help build up their strength and stamina. Boxers, wrestlers and others believe eating dog and snake will give them the endurance and strength of the animals. <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> newspapers reported the <ORGANIZATION> Korea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amateur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hockey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> provided the country's womens' Olympic team with $ 28,000 worth of snake soup. Association officials declined to comment. Star player <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Kye-sook </PERSON> was quoted by <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Korea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> as saying, `` I was so surprised when the association officials brought the snake soup to us. But after taking the soup, I felt much stronger.'' Olympic soccer star <PERSON> Choi </PERSON> <PERSON> Soon-ho </PERSON> was quoted as saying he ate 500 snakes as part of his summer training. The Korean Amateur Wrestling Federation provided funds to the Olympic wrestling team to buy snake soup and `` kaesoju,'' a mixture of dog meat and herbs that builds strength, newspapers reported. Officials say a ban was imposed on dog meat in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> about five years ago because the government feared dog restaurants would offend Westerners and create an image of Koreans eating lovable pets. Sales continued, and restaurant owners say city officials recently repeated warnings not to serve dog during the Olympics. But they said officials told them restrictions would be eased after the Games. A senior official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the ban backfired by focusing attention on the dog meat issue. He said it also stirred protests from many Koreans about ridiculing national tradition. `` The French eat snails and horses and everyone says they are great eaters. Why should n't we eat dogmeat?'' he said. Koreans say dogs used for eating are specially raised just like cattle. They bridle at suggestions that pets are eaten and say they love and care for dogs as much as anyone. A restaurant owner, who takes pride in his own special recipe for dog stew, said the food was a traditional part of Korean cooking and a part of the nation's culture. The meat is seasoned with garlic and other spices and usually served as stew. `` How can our indigenous habits be cast away in a day,'' the man said. `` I'm sure this will not perish forever by any means.'' <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> municipal officials conceded the ban was very difficult to impose and it has had little impact. Dog meat restaurants are still legal in the rest of the country. Restaurant owners caught selling dog meat three times in a year have their licenses confiscated, officials said. No statistics were available on the number of cases prosecuted by the city. `` You tell us where they are selling dog food and we will send an inspector,'' said a Health Department official. Some foreigners, far from being appalled by dog meat, have tried the dish and found it agreeable. `` It's good. Much better than roast pork,'' said one visiting journalist.

 <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> says it's time Americans `` start caring'' about the educational needs of all citizens, and he is promising to put the focus on the issue if confirmed as the next education secretary. `` I know this wo n't be turned around in a decade. We ca n't wait any longer. We've waited too long,'' <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> as it considered his nomination Friday to replace outgoing Education Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>. If sworn in, <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> would become the first Hispanic member of a president's <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON>, 61, appeared headed for an easy confirmation, with senators praising the son of a cattle foreman on the King Ranch in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> who went on to become president of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. He became the first Hispanic and the first graduate of the school to hold the post with his selection in 1980. `` He is eminently qualified for this appointment with considerable experience in higher education,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION> `` And in view of the fact that he has 10 children between the ages of 21 and 31, he has also had a central investment in elementary and secondary education.'' <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., said he was impressed and reassured by <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON>' testimony that he would fight for increased spending and for making the <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> a vigorous advocate of education for all `` Your responses have been enormously helpful and I look forward to supporting you now,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. `` I'm going to do everything we can to assure an early confirmation.'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said a vote by the committee may be taken Tuesday. `` It seems like you're the type of person who can come in here and heal any wounds that might exist, and build that consensus,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> last month nominated <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> to replace the often-confrontational <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>. <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON>, during questioning by <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, said he disagreed with some of <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s positions, including the secretary's claim that bilingual education had been a failure. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> declared in 1985 there was no evidence that the Bilingual Education Act had helped children, but <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> said: `` I believe there has been a tremendous amount of success across a long period of time.'' <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> praised <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> and the administration's leadership in education, however, saying that in the past seven years `` we have arrested the decline in American education, but ... we still have much to accomplish.'' `` We must do everything in our power to help each student reach his or her potential,'' <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> said. `` To remain a great nation, we must ensure that no human resource is left untapped. ... We must keep our young people in school, make our citizens literate, provide opportunity to our minority students, and foster independence for handicapped students. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> needs the full participation of every individual and the only way to ensure this is through quality education.'' <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> has a bachelor's degree in zoology and a master's degree in cytology _ the study of cells _ from <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tech </ORGANIZATION> and a 1954 doctorate in physiology from <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Koch Seeks Compromise on Sludge-Dumping Bills</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> has characterized as `` savage'' and `` less savage'' a pair of bills that would call for an end to sludge dumping in the ocean by 1993, but he urged the two be rolled into one to make the city's fight easier. `` We hope that when the bill comes to the floor it will be one bill, the two -LRB- committee -RRB- chairs will compromise out their differences and that we do n't have to fight on every level, front and back and on all sides,'' <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said Friday. `` We would like to be able to deal with one bill.'' The mayor met with <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, and Rep. <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>. Pepper is chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rules </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which could order that the two bills be combined <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and Pepper indicated `` they will consider the request on merits,'' <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said. The two bills _ one sponsored by Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, the other by Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Nowak </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION> _ both mandate that <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and eight other sewage authorities stop dumping sludge in the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> by Dec. 31, 1992. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, which produces 3.8 million wet tons of sludge a year, has said it can not meet that deadline and needs until at least 1998 to find disposal alternatives. The other authorities that are dumping sludge 106 miles offshore are: <LOCATION> Nassau </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Westchester </LOCATION> counties in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>; and in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Middlesex </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Passaic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Meeting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Essex </ORGANIZATION> and Union Counties; <LOCATION> Bergen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Rahway </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Linden-Roselle </PERSON>. Those authorities that fail to meet the deadline would be fined on a scale that could subject <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to paying somewhere between $ 146 million and $ 730 million a year, according to <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Chesser </PERSON>, the city's <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> representative. The city does not like either bill; <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> called the Hughes version `` savage'' and the <PERSON> Nowak </PERSON> bill `` less savage.'' The key difference between the two is the <PERSON> Nowak </PERSON> bill would allow the city to enter a consent decree with the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> which could stipulate that the dumping end by a date later than 1992, although the fines would still go into effect, <PERSON> Chesser </PERSON> said. `` We would be negotiating a consent decree on a schedule we felt we could meet,'' she said of the <PERSON> Nowak </PERSON> bill. `` EPA, of course, would be pushing us to have the most expedited schedule possible.'' The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has stopped negotiating with <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> over the city's compromise offer to stop dumping by 1998, said <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, a regional <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> `` We're not negotiating any deadline yet because we're waiting to see what <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is going to do,'' he said. Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> last month passed a similar bill to stop the dumping of sewage sludge by January 1992. Under that bill, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> could end up paying up to $ 152 million in fines, according to <PERSON> Chesser </PERSON>. City officials arehoping a later deadline will be worked out when the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bills move to conference for reconciliation.

 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration is disappointed that negotiations on military bases in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> have broken down, but Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> says <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials will be patient. He said the demands <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> had made on <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> were `` out of bounds.'' `` We will be patient, and we will be persistent,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said Friday. `` But we'll also stick to our basic ideas.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> will meet in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> next week with <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> and again in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> at the end of the month when they attend the special session of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said `` we seemed to have things on a pretty good track'' when he saw <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> on a trip to <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> last July. `` But, subsequently, it did n't work out that way,'' he said. `` I am a little disappointed right now,'' he told the board of directors of the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION>'s Clubs. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> spoke to the group about various foreign policy issues.

The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is paying the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> $ 180 million a year for use of the <ORGANIZATION> Subic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Air </PERSON> <PERSON> Base </PERSON>. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials have not said what the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has offered to extend the agreement past 1991 and what the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> demanded. <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON>, in a news conference Friday in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had offered $ 502 million for use of the bases and four smaller installations. <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> sources told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had offered to double the yearly payment to $ 360 million as part of a $ 489 aid package. According to the sources, who spoke only on condition of anonymity, the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> requested more than $ 1 billion a year in overall aid. Asked if he would insist on the same figure when he meets with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> replied, `` Oh, yes. We shall be clarifying that our position is reasonable.'' `` We frankly think that what the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> seems to be asking is out of bounds, `` <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said, without referring to any specific figure. `` We are saying that to them and trying to convince them.'' He said the two bases were `` very useful to us'' and `` we believe they are very useful for the security of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>.''

 The Serbian <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief's public defiance of the national leadership has thrown this <LOCATION> Balkan </LOCATION> country of competing ethnic groups into its most explosive political crisis of the postwar era <PERSON> Slobodan </PERSON> <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON> on Tuesday rejected a call from the federal <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presidium </ORGANIZATION> to put an end to nationalist rallies in the southern province of <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>, where minority Slavs contend they are harrassed by ethnic Albanians who form 90 percent of the province's population. On Tuesday, more than 100,000 Serbs and Montenegrins, who are Slavs, staged protest rallies. Demonstrators shouted, `` Give us arms'' and `` Army to <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>,'' underscoring the Serbian leadership's demand to send the army to <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> to restore order. <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> is an autonomous region within the republic of <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON> and other Serbian leaders want to change the federal constitution so the republic can assert control over <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> and the autonomous province of <LOCATION> Vojvodina </LOCATION>. Under the 1974 constitution, <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION> can not interfere in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>'s judiciary, police or other institutions Leaders of other republics oppose the idea. Newspaper editorials have said that the foundation of the Yugoslav state is threatened. Commenting on the showdown, the daily Vjesnik of <LOCATION> Zagreb </LOCATION>, capital of <LOCATION> Croatia </LOCATION>, warned that an increasing number of Yugoslavs were questioning the 1943 agreement that gave birth to communist <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>. The nation is made up of six republics, each of which has its own constitution, assembly and president. `` We witness a sharpening of nationalism and chauvinism on the entire <LOCATION> Yugoslav </LOCATION> territory,'' the editorial said. <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>'s supporters planned weekend rallies in the city of <LOCATION> Jajce </LOCATION>, where the agreement was worked out, but local officials rejected the plan. The organizers then said they would hold a `` solidarity meeting'' there Sept. 17. <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON> has lashed out at the national leadership by saying the <LOCATION> Serbs </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Montenegrins </ORGANIZATION> have `` shown patience for the inefficiency of this country and the incompetence of its representatives.'' In Tuesday's speech, he asserted <LOCATION> Yugoslav </LOCATION> leaders failed to bring peace to <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>. Referring to Slavs living there, he said, `` This summer their patience came to an end.'' <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON> defended the fast-spreading Serbian discontent as justified expression of popular sentiment, while opponents say it will result in anarchy. Within hours, the <ORGANIZATION> Yugoslav </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> scheduled a session for late September to take action on <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>, who enjoys popular support in <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> press. On Friday, the <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> news agency said a police unit from another part of <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION> would leave for <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> to reinforce local police. On Thursday, more than 10,000 Serbs and Montenegrins assembled at the <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Vucitrn </LOCATION> to protest what they called `` aggressive assaults of Albanian chauvinists and separatists,'' the <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> Politika </ORGANIZATION> reported. The rally followed an attack last week on the home of a Serbian woman. Two ethnic Albanians, convicted of damaging the house, were sentenced to 30 days in jail. The ethnic <PERSON> Albanian </PERSON> judge involved was dismissed and the terms were increased to 60 days. Demonstrators were heard singing a folk song that boldly compares <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON> to the late President <PERSON> Josip </PERSON> <PERSON> Broz </PERSON> <PERSON> Tito </PERSON>, the virtually uncontested leader of non-aligned <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> for three decades. Most Belgrade newspapers give a lopsided view of what is going on in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>, scene of bloody rioting for greater autonomy in 1981. They keep reiterating that more than 30,000 Serbs and <PERSON> Montenegrins </PERSON> left the province in recent years because of arson and other attacks blamed on Albanians. Ethnic Albanians are rarely given a chance to respond in public to what appear to be grossly distorted accounts. In the regime-controlled press, the Slav exodus is entirely blamed on the Albanians, an estimated 500 of whom are in jail. The <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported Friday that authorities in <LOCATION> Duesseldorf </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, warned Albanian families from towns in <LOCATION> Macedonia </LOCATION> they would be turned down as political refugees because `` their true motives ... are purely economic.'' Conversely, <LOCATION> Serbian </LOCATION> media have had practically no reports that Slavs have relocated for economic reasons from <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s most underdeveloped region

 A 13-ton stash of marijuana was discovered aboard a Honduran-registered freighter stopped in British waters last week, a customs official said. `` There's tons of it coming out,'' <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Biles </PERSON> of the Customs and <ORGANIZATION> Excise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Friday of the discovery on the ship, identified as the <LOCATION> Salton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. `` It's ... a big pro job.'' <PERSON> Biles </PERSON> said the ship's Dutch captain, three Dutch crewmen and four Colombian crewmen were charged with illegally importing cannabis into <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and were being held in police custody. The Honduran-registered ship was captured Sept. 3 after a chase across the English Channel from the northeast coast of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, where it had failed to stop for a routine check by <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> customs officers.

 It's time for a clean sweep in this east-central <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> town _ and in most places, say promoters of the annual Broomcorn Festival in the self-proclaimed Broomcorn Capital of the World. <PERSON> Broomcorn </PERSON>? The stuff that brooms are made of _ actually a form of sorghum. And it does n't last forever. `` People always say, ` I've got to buy a new broom,' but they do n't,'' said <PERSON> Alvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Winger </PERSON>, whose <ORGANIZATION> Warren </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> _ one of seven broom makers around this town of 2,700 _ has been in business since 1900. `` You ca n't do much with an old broom except sweep rocks off the driveway,'' he said. So the highlight of this year's festival is a broom-burning _ come one, come all. Those who chuck a broom into a bonfire today receive a discount on a new one. The fiery event has a message: A new broom sweeps clean. `` Take a look at a new broom. The straws are split into little feathery ends. That's what picks up the dust and dirt,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Libman </PERSON>, whose family owns <ORGANIZATION> Libman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the biggest of the area producers. Brooms provide 250 jobs in the broomcorn capital, although much of the broomcorn _ which must be hand-harvested _ is imported from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Arcola </LOCATION> goes all out to celebrate its industry. In addition to the bonfire, the three-day festival ending Sunday features a parade, a miniature corn palace, broom-making demonstrations, folk crafts and country cooking. It has drawn as many as 50,000 visitors in past years, said spokesman <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hines </PERSON>.

 Only in <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> could a $ 200,000, chauffeur-driven <ORGANIZATION> Rolls-Royce </ORGANIZATION> be considered an eyesore. But that's the problem facing <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Spellerberg </PERSON>, who says he has gotten nothing but complaints _ and threat of prosecution _ for parking his 1954 black Rolls in front of his art gallery on Rodeo Drive. He says his neighbors are n't just mad about the car, but the people it attracts: namely thousands of tourists in the last six months who have posed in front of the sleek black beauty while their pictures were being taken. `` Anyplace else in the world and people would be happy to have a <ORGANIZATION> Rolls-Royce </ORGANIZATION> parked in front of their business,'' said <PERSON> Spellerberg </PERSON>. `` But not <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Spellerberg </PERSON> readily admits he leaves the car in the one-hour metered space as a tourist attraction at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gallery </ORGANIZATION>, which sells seascapes and other traditional-style paintings and sculptures. His chauffeur stands by, reading a book and feeding the meter with $ 15 in quarters each day. `` After all, was n't it the public and tourists that made <LOCATION> Rodeo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Drive </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> famous?'' he asks in a full-page ad taken out Friday in a local paper. `` This magnificent vintage <ORGANIZATION> Rolls-Royce </ORGANIZATION> has allowed thousands to capture a touch of the ` glitter and glamour' that <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> is famous for.'' But the city does n't see it that way. In fact, the city attorney wrote to <PERSON> Spellerberg </PERSON>'s attorney saying that the matter has been passed to the `` litigation-prosecution department.'' There was no answer at city hall offices Friday, which was a state holiday. But in general, parking meter regulations in the region do not allow motorists to keep their cars indefinitely in one spot, even if they return periodically to feed the meter. <PERSON> Spellerberg </PERSON>, however, says he wo n't give up. His advertisement in the <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Courier </LOCATION> urges people to phone City Hall and speak up in support of the Rolls. `` This is just one of those crazy things your hear about,'' he said. `` I did n't think it would happen to me.''

 Vietnamese officials are willing to allow the excavation of 100 sites to search for the remains of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> servicemen missing since the Vietnam War, says a member of a congressional delegation who was in <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> earlier this month. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military officials had been scheduled to begin a round of meetings on the MIA search Friday in <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>, but the talks were called off after a Vietnamese jetliner crashed minutes before landing in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, said Lt.

The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military team was to have taken the Friday afternoon return flight to <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> for the technical talks, said <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Petzing </PERSON>, spokesman for the embassy in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kudla </PERSON> said the talks could begin as early as next week.

There are 2,398 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> personnel still unaccounted for in the war, <PERSON> Bustamante </PERSON> said.

 Miss <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> played a classical piano piece and <LOCATION> Miss </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> wore a `` supersuit'' to victory in preliminary competitions for the <ORGANIZATION> Miss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pageant </ORGANIZATION> on Friday night. Miss <PERSON> Utah </PERSON> <PERSON> Sophia </PERSON> <PERSON> Christine </PERSON> <PERSON> Symko </PERSON>, 21, of <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, played an energetic version of `` Spanish Rhapsody.'' She has studied piano for 17 years. `` There were always times when I wanted to quit playing and my parents encouraged me to continue,'' she said in an earlier interview. `` Now I'm so glad I did. I use my piano playing as a part-time job to earn money for my schooling. I would n't trade that for anything.'' For her performance Miss <PERSON> Symko </PERSON> wore a classical Spanish dress of black satin trimmed in large red satin ruffles that hung off the shoulders and with a ruffled red petticoat. She wore a matching red flowered headpiece. Miss Symko, born in <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, is a graduate student at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> pursuing her masters in physics.

<HEAD>Andrei Sakharov Says Party and Gorbachev Back Away From Some
Reforms</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, the Nobel laureate and leading Soviet dissenter, says he sees signs that the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> hierarchy and <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> himself are retreating from some areas of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reform program. Asked Friday if <PERSON> Yegor </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>, a member of the ruling Politburo, was behind the opposition to perestroika, or restructuring, <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> said <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>'s speeches show he is `` a reactionary, dangerous force, but by far not the only one.'' Regarding <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> said he believed the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> chief's speeches have `` become more radical and show a deeper understanding of the situation,'' but he saw elements of backtracking. The 67-year-old nuclear physicist, winner of the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize, said foes of perestroika are behind the continued defense here of the Soviet-led invasion of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> in 1968 that crushed a liberal communist government. He said the reforms in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> that led to the invasion are similar to programs now being pushed in the Soviet republic of <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> spoke with reporters after he was presented with a certificate by <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Matlock </PERSON> making him an honorary member of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> and Letters. The scientist, a key figure in developing the Soviet hydrogen bomb, later helped found the Soviet human rights movement. He was exiled to Gorky in 1980 for criticizing the Soviet military intervention in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and was only allowed to return to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in December 1986. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> called perestroika a `` historical inevitability,'' but added, `` In May, perestroika reached a very different period which could be called a reversal.'' He did not specify what happened in May, but remarked that the change `` showed at the 19th -LRB- Communist -RRB- Party conference -LRB- in June -RRB- in anti-perestroika forces.'' <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> said `` anti-glasnost forces clearly had the advantage'' at the conference of 5,000 delegates held in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> June 28-July 1. Glasnost is <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s campaign for greater openness on selected subjects. Some delegates at the party conference accused the official media of slandering people and of minimizing Soviet achievements. In August, the government announced limits on the number of subscriptions the public would be allowed for certain publications, most of which are involved in <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s drive to re-evaluate history in a more truthful manner and report current problems. Because of the subscription limits `` glasnost will be limited to a small circle of people and this will harm the whole process,'' <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> said. Soviet officials have said the restrictions were needed because there is n't enough paper for the newspapers and magazines to satisfy demand. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> said the reason is that anti-perestroika forces want to silence the publications. In presenting the award to <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> on Friday, <PERSON> Matlock </PERSON> quoted the American academy as saying: `` His absolute courage and absolute honesty make him a friend of all those who share a belief in reason, in freedom of inquiry and in democracy, for the sake of which he risked both his health and his life.'' The academy is a New York-based society of artists, writers and musicians.

 Police fired rubber bullets and water cannons to break up an anti-government rally of 20,000 during a nationwide general strike. Labor leaders called for another work stoppage Monday. The clashes with police, vandalism, burning of cars and looting of stores resulted in dozens of injuries and arrests during the walkout Friday protesting spiraling inflation and unemployment. The unrest made the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conferation </ORGANIZATION>'s 12th general strike against the nearly 5-year-old government of President <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> the most disorderly and bloody. Labor leaders and police blamed each other for the violence. `` It's a lie that the incidents began among participants of the rally,'' said <PERSON> Saul </PERSON> <PERSON> Ubaldini </PERSON>, general-secretary of the labor confederation. Interior Minister <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Nosiglia </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Pirker </PERSON> said agitators in the crowd started fights, as did members of rival unions. When police attempted to restore order, they were attacked, the said. `` Under these circumstances, police intervened to prevent further damage,'' <PERSON> Nosiglia </PERSON> said. The police action was `` necessary, prudent and correct,'' <PERSON> Pirker </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Nosiglia </PERSON> in a brief communique urged the federation to call off the Monday walkout. `` Nothing justifies a new paralysis of the country, which keeps delaying progress without any benefit to rights and liberties,'' he said. No deaths were reported in the unrest Friday, but several people had not regained consciousness hours after they were hospitalized. About 50 people were treated at <LOCATION> Argerich </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> for tear gas inhalation, contusions from rocks and sticks, and abrasions from falling to the ground when struck by compressed water fired by riot police. Several dozen others went to at least two other hospitals. Two policemen were rushed to <LOCATION> Churruca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> with severe injuries, and about 20 others were treated for minor injuries. <PERSON> Pirker </PERSON> said he did not know the total number of people arrested. Inflation has soared 255 percent this year, and 440 percent for the past 12 months. Unemployment and underemployment at a combined 14 percent are near 14-year highs. Real personal incomes have declined for three straight years. `` Every day there's less work and my family ca n't live on what I earn,'' said <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rio </PERSON>, a middle-aged truck driver who attended the rally. `` That's why I'm here.'' President <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> five weeks ago implemented his third major anti-inflation plan since he took office in December 1983. The austral was devalued, restrictions on some imports were lifted and voluntary controls placed on wages and prices. The goal, in addition to reducing inflation, was to secure new loans from the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> and commercial banks to help repay interest _ $ 4.6 billion this year _ on <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s $ 56 billion foreign debt. Unions and the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Peronist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> raise the sensitive issue of national sovereignty in response to <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>'s shaping of national policy to meet demands by foreign banks. The 3.5-million member federation has complained bitterly that prices have risen despite the controls and pressed for higher wages. Friday's strike was effective across this South American country of 30 million. In the capital, <PERSON> Buenos </PERSON> <PERSON> Aires </PERSON>, striking signalmen shut down commuter trains before dawn, stranding thousands of people at home and causing huge backups on roads leading downtown. After 8 p.m., the hour the strike was scheduled to end, public transportation resumed and the capital city of 3 million was calm. Late Friday, several public transport unions said they would participate in Monday's strike, indicating that buses and subways will be out of service as well as commuter trains.

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> remained deadlocked at U.N.-mediated peace talks and a recess appeared near after both sides publicly accused the other of blocking progress. In a statement Friday, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said talks can not go anywhere unless the disputed Shatt-al-Arab waterway is cleared and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> is allowed free navigation in it. <PERSON> Shatt-al-Arab </PERSON> is <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s only outlet to the sea and forms the southern boundary of the two nations. The statement was in response to comments Thursday by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s foreign minister, <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> told reporters that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> considered the two issues related to the waterway `` extraneous elements'' that should be raised later in the talks. The Iraqi statement dismissed <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s position as `` fantasy'' and accused <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> of wasting time. A U.N.-sponsored cease-fire took effect Aug. 20, clearing the way for talks on a lasting settlement of the nearly 8-year-old <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war. Face-to-face meetings were held only on the first two days of negotiations, and neither foreign minister has met <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> mediator <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Eliasson </PERSON> since last Saturday. Lower-level contacts have continued. Signs increased Friday that talks would be suspended over the weekend before resuming in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> later this month. Diplomatic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Eliasson </PERSON> was expected to announce a recess and that the last few days were spent haggling over a resumption date. Among <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s priorities at the talks are a withdrawal of troops to internationally recognized boundaries, exchange of war prisoners and a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> investigation to determine who started the war. On the border question, the countries are at odds over a 1975 treaty setting the Iran-Iraq boundary down the middle of the Shatt-al-Arab. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has renounced the pact and claimed the entire waterway, but <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> says it still considers the treaty valid.

 Hurricane Florence moved across the tip of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and headed toward the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> on Friday night, flogging coastal communities with 80 mph winds as thousands of residents fled to higher ground. An <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> man preparing for the storm drowned while trying to tie down a boat. Winds were well below the 100 mph predicted while <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION> was offshore. `` When it's a hurricane I get out,'' said <LOCATION> Melodia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Buras </LOCATION>, of <LOCATION> Boothville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, who joined about 500 others Friday night at <ORGANIZATION> Belle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chasse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, which was opened as a shelter for <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION> and other <LOCATION> Plaquemines </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Parish </LOCATION> towns in coastal <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>. Shortly before midnight, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> discontinued its hurricane watch for western coast of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Morgan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> line. At 11 p.m., the center of the 250-mile wide storm was about 60 miles southeast of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, over the <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>. The weather service said it was moving north at 12-15 mph and its eye was expected to continue in that direction and wind speed ovenight. The eye, about 30 miles wide, was expected to sideswipe eastern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> and hit the <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> about 4 a.m. Forecasters warned coastal residents to prepare for 9-foot tides and up to 10 inches of rain. Tornado watches were posted from <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Charles </LOCATION>, La. A <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> helicopter had to abandon plans to rescue four men on work barges trapped at the mouth of the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dewell </PERSON>. He said wind speeds there were at over 90 mph. `` It looks like they're going to have to ride it out. The hurricane, as well as I can make out, is right about there,'' said <PERSON> Dewell </PERSON>. Earlier, a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> helicopter rescued two fishermen who got into trouble while running their crab traps, also near the mouth of the river. In <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, police in the coastal community of <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beach </ORGANIZATION> said a 32-year-old man drowned Friday afternoon when he fell into the water as he was trying to tie down a boat in windy, rainy conditions. `` They were trying to secure a boat and one of their lines got caught up underneath it,'' Cpl. <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Glass </PERSON> said. He said the man, who could not swim, lost his balance tugging on the snagged line and fell into a bayou, about half a mile from the Gulf. <PERSON> Luke </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrovich </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Plaquemines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> president, said that as <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION> passed over the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delta </LOCATION> parish, it knocked out power to the homes of some 7,000 residents. About 1,600 of those residents moved into evacuation centers. Others sought shelter with friends and family on higher ground. Democratic presidential candidate <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> postponed indefinitely an outdoor rally at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>' Jackson Square as well as two indoor fund-raisers: a $ 1,000-per-couple cocktail party and a $ 10,000-per-couple buffet. <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION>, which had been stalled in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, suddenly strengthened into a hurricane Friday morning and began churning northward at 15 mph, the National Hurricane Center reported. Maximum sustained wind speed near the storm's center was 80 mph at 11 p.m., well over the 74 mph threshhold at which a tropical storm is designated a hurricane, said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheets </PERSON>, director of the hurricane center. An estimated 10,000 <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> coast residents moved to higher ground, with more in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, and students in parts of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> were dismissed from classes early in preparation for the hurricane. Evacuation shelters opened at late afternoon in the four states. Some Friday night high school football games were canceled. But not everyone was heading for higher ground. <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> <PERSON> Mallon </PERSON>, who lives on the tiny <LOCATION> Dauphin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, a barrier island off the <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> coast, said he was n't leaving. `` Once you make up your mind to stay, all you can do is stay,'' <PERSON> Mallon </PERSON> said, boarding up his house. The training aircraft carrier <LOCATION> USS </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, based at <ORGANIZATION> Pensacola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION>, put out to sea Friday morning to ride out the storm, said <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Flowers </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> declared a state of emergency Friday. <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> Emergency Management Director <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said the declaration would allow officials to cope with the potential side effects of the hurricane, including the need for public shelters and the possibility of tornadoes and flash floods. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said motel space as far north as <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> had been filled by evacuees. Mississippi Lt. Gov. <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Dye </PERSON>, acting in behalf of Gov. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Mabus </PERSON>, who was out of state, also declared a state of emergency to activate the <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, which will coordinate any needed clean up. From <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, where he was on an industry-seeking mission, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> ordered the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> to stand by for emergency duty. Boat owners moved their vessels to safe harbors. `` We've put everything we've got on land into the water. We tie it good so if the tide goes up the boat goes up,'' said <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Speas </PERSON>, manager of <LOCATION> Dog </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marina </LOCATION>, south of Mobile, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION> ` We began evacuating the harbors Thursday and we are now in full bore,'' said <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> <PERSON> Guice </PERSON>, who has headed <LOCATION> Harrison </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, civil defense for three decades. `` Shelters will be up and we'll be doing all the other things we usually do when a hurricane threatens.'' In <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, workers closed storm gates on bayous and canals leading inland toward more heavily populated areas, beginning to button up gaps in the ring of levees that surround metropolitan <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. The levees and big pumps keep the saucer-shaped <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> area dry. At its highest point, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> is about 14 feet above sea level. Much of it is below sea level. Exactly 23 years ago Hurricane <PERSON> Betsy </PERSON> pushed a storm surge over levees and flooded the eastern end of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, killing 70 people in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and causing $ 1.1 billion in damages. `` We have a more improved levee system and hurricane protection system than we had 20 years ago,'' said <LOCATION> Plaquemines </LOCATION> Parish President <PERSON> Luke </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrovich </PERSON>. `` We tripled the capacity of our drainage pump systems and we've increased the height of our levees by about 20 percent.'' At <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Isle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, a sandy strip just off the coast southwest of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, Mayor <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Valence </PERSON> ordered residents to evacuate. `` If they do n't move out they will be arrested,'' <LOCATION> Valence </LOCATION> said. `` They will not be detained, but they will get a citation.'' Residents in the affected areas were fortunate that strong wind had stalled <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION> on Thursday, preventing it from strengthening for a day, forecaster <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmer </PERSON> said. `` It could have been worse,'' he said, noting that early September is the height of the hurricane season, when wind and warm water conditions are ideal for storm development. <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION>, the sixth named storm of the 1988 <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> season, is the second hurricane. The first, <PERSON> Debby </PERSON>, reached minimal hurricane strength briefly before hitting the coast of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> last month.

<HEAD>Democrats Concede They Lack Votes to Pass Sanctions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democrats are pressing ahead with a package of economic sanctions against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, but concede that a united front of Republican opposition will probably keep the measure from coming to a vote in the full chamber. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> will vote next Wednesday on the bill, which would impose a near-total trade embargo against white-dominated <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and a near-total withdrawal of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investment in the country. Republican members of the panel, accusing Democrats of playing election-year politics with the issue, refused a chance to offer amendments to the bill on Friday. They said they prefer the bill as it stands because it is so extensive that it will not attract enough votes to cut off a filibuster on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor. `` My guess is that it will be approved by the committee,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, D-Ill., a principal author of the legislation `` But because the Republicans are apparently united it will not have the votes to overcome a filibuster _ we wo n't get cloture _ that's the way it looks right now,'' said <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>. `` But even if we do nothing more than pass it out of committee, it is a signal to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> that we want to change the system'' of forced racial separation known as apartheid, he said. Sixty votes are required in the 100-member <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to invoke cloture and cut off debate on a bill. The 1988 Democratic platform brands <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> a terrorist state and Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has supported sanctions. Republican presidential candidate <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has opposed new sanctions on they ground they would remove any leverage the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> may have to work for change in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. After a morning-long debate on the sanctions bill, <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> committee member Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, told reporters: `` I think it's clearly, clearly pushed by domestic political considerations and not be the urgency of the situation in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. I think the bill as it now sits will not have a single Republican vote on the committee.'' A coalition of Democrats and Republicans enacted a milder South African sanctions bill two years ago over President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto. Supporters of the present measure contend it is needed because the earlier and less-sweeping bill has not forced the South African government to end apartheid and to extend full citizenship rights to the black majority. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> adopted a similar version of the far-reaching <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill on Aug. 11.

<HEAD>Senate Votes Tough Sanctions Against Iraq</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved by voice vote stiff economic sanctions against <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and condemned the alleged use of poison gas by the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> government against the country's Kurdish minority. `` The Iraqi army is waging a campaign against the Kurdish population that can only be described as genocide,'' Sen. <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, said Friday just before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> passed the measure just 18 hours after it was drafted. `` This is truly a crime against humanity. It is genocide, in fact,'' said <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, deploring the use of poison gas against Kurdish civilians and the dynamiting of Kurdish villages. Reps. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON>, D-Calif., and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>, R-Ill., introduced an identical measure in the The lawmakers, co-chairmen of the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION>, also sent a letter to <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> calling for an end to `` warfare against the Kurdish population.'' <PERSON> Sadoon </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, minister of state for foreign affairs, repeated denials Friday that any poison-gas attack had taken place. He said independent observers might be permitted in the northern border area of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, where many of the Kurds live, if hostilities in the region end. The bill, which was sent to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, would require the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> representative to international financial institutions such as the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> to vote against all loans to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. It would also bar all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> financial credits or credit guarantees. Aides to <PERSON> Pell </PERSON> said this would immediately halt at least $ 800 million in credit or credit guarantees, a step they said would make it even more difficult for <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> to service its huge $ 60 billion debt incurred during its eight-year war with neighboring <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The measure also would end the import of <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> oil into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, end any <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic or military aid and bar the transfer to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> of sensitive high technology items subject to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> export controls. The <PERSON> Pell </PERSON> aides, who declined to be identified, said the latter step would prevent <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> from importing vital spare parts for equipment and technology already in the country, prevent it from completing certain projects and bar the export to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> of such items as computers, petroleum drilling equipment and air traffic control equipment. <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, stressing the bipartisan support on the foreign policy issue, said he hoped the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration will quickly endorse the bill.

<HEAD>Festival Lost In The Controversy Over Scorsese Film</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRY LEONARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VENICE, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Sixty films were presented at this year's <ORGANIZATION> Venice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Festival </ORGANIZATION>, but it was <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scorsese </PERSON>'s `` The Last Tempatation of Christ'' that monopolized attention, frustrating directors who feared their work was lost in the controversy Even before the festival began, the Italian media had dubbed it `` The Festival of Controversy'' because of protests against <PERSON> Scorsese </PERSON>'s film. It includes a sequence in which <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> hallucinates on the cross about abandoning his role as savior, marrying <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Magdalene </PERSON> and raising a family. <PERSON> Scorsese </PERSON>'s film already had been under heavy attack in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and elsewhere from some Christians and church groups. In <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION>, the film was condemned by <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> bishops, <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION>, followers of excommunicated Archbishop <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s dominant Christian Democrat party. `` The importance of Scorsese comes from the fact that it was the first screening in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and people were interested in seeing the reaction in a society very different from <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> ... in the center of the Catholic world,'' said <PERSON> Adriano </PERSON> <PERSON> Donaggio </PERSON>, spokesman for the festival that ended Friday. Festival director <PERSON> Guglielmo </PERSON> <PERSON> Biraghi </PERSON>, a former critic, said he welcomed the controversy as long as it was constructive. But some directors feared their work would simply vanish in the fog surrounding Scorsese and his film. Italian director <PERSON> Franco </PERSON> <PERSON> Zeffirelli </PERSON> once threatened to withdraw his film, `` Il Giovane Toscanini'' -LRB- The Young <PERSON> Toscanini </PERSON> -RRB-, because he feared it could be overlooked if shown too close to <ORGANIZATION> Scorsese </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>. In the end, <PERSON> Zeffirelli </PERSON> left <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION> in a huff, vowing never to return. His film drew sustained applause from the <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION> audience but painful reviews from the critics. `` I have brought my film to <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION> to satisfy the producers. I did not want to come. Now I put on my crown of thorns and here I am, on <LOCATION> Calvary </LOCATION>,'' he said at a news conference Monday. In a telling incident, <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> director <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Almodovar </PERSON> angrily returned to a news conference Wednesday moments after he left to berate festival officials for excluding some <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> journalists. But actually, it was the police who denied entry to the late-arriving Spaniards. They feared the conference room already was dangerously overcrowded. Hundreds were waiting for <PERSON> Scorsese </PERSON>, who was greeted with an ovation when he arrived surrounded by bodyguards. During the turbulent news conference, <PERSON> Scorsese </PERSON> defended his film as a work of fiction, based on a novel. He said the film did not seek to change anyone's religious convictions. The film was panned by many critics in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, who complained of uninspired acting and banal dialouge. Still, <PERSON> Scorsese </PERSON> was seen by many as a symbol of standing against censorship. `` The biggest problem at this festival was Scorsese,'' said <PERSON> Donaggio </PERSON>. But he added that the Scorsese film was also one of the festival's successes this year. The success, he said, was defending the right to show a controversial film and let the public be the judge.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Yonkers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> reversed itself and approved a court-ordered housing desegregation plan early Saturday, caving in as fines hit $ 1 million a day, hundreds of workers faced layoffs and public opinion shifted against them. The 5-to-2 vote came at about 1:30 a.m. following a day of meetings and discussions as pressure grew to resolve the crisis, with hardliners in a raucous <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hall </LOCATION> condemning the politicians who now supported the plan. As the final roll call was called and two of the four recalcitrant councilmen, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Chema </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Longo </PERSON>, changed their votes, a crowd of about 100 in the gallery at City Hall broke into loud cheers. `` It's time to put behind the fines, the fight and the turmoil,'' said <PERSON> Chema </PERSON> before switching his vote. But others in the audience were infuriated by the reversal. One woman yelled, `` You little snake'' at Chema, while another man screeched at Mayor <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wasicsko </PERSON>, `` You sold us out, <PERSON> Nicky </PERSON>! We'll remember!'' The mayor also voted for the plan. The city of 194,000 just north of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> has incurred $ 1.6 million in fines. <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION> faced a $ 1 million fine Friday and was to begin laying off hundreds of city workers Saturday. The fines had started at $ 100 and doubled each day, reaching $ 819,200 Thursday for a total of $ 1,638,300. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Sand </PERSON>, who ordered the end to segregated housing in <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION> three years ago, will determine if the city must pay Friday's fine. `` It's our understanding that if we pass this tonight, we will not'' have to pay Friday's fine, city attorney <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickelle </PERSON> said before the vote. <PERSON> Wasicsko </PERSON> said he received a message from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> Gail </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaffer </PERSON>, head of the state financial control board, saying the layoffs set for Saturday had been rescinded by the state <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. Both <PERSON> Chema </PERSON> and <PERSON> Longo </PERSON> prefaced Saturday's roll-call vote with long speeches saying they had reached agreements with the plaintiffs to make changes in the ordinance, but also realized the judge would not agree to those changes unless the councilmen changed their votes. `` In the past we have thought of those fines somewhat in the abstract,'' <PERSON> Longo </PERSON> said. `` It was the city being fined and the city being affected ... the abstract has now become a reality.'' The city has been in contempt of court for the council's refusal to carry out the housing-desegregation order it approved earlier this year. Among the modifications made in the housing decree under the agreement with the plaintiffs was a commitment to build 100 stand-alone units, instead of the 200 previously approved, with the rest to be part of other housing developments. <PERSON> Chema </PERSON> said they will also consider a home owners insurance policy to make up the difference in a loss of property value when a home owner sold a home. Changes in the plan worked out between the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advancement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colored </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> and the council members must be approved by Sand, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> and Urban Development. Earlier, a lawyer for the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Sussman </PERSON>, said the two sides had `` hammered out a fairly complex agreement'' but that Sand refused to consider the revised plan. Earlier Friday, the council and <PERSON> Wasicsko </PERSON> gathered and voted to transfer $ 819,200 to pay Thursday's fine. As the councilmen entered City Hall, some of the crowd _ angered by the report of negotiations _ shouted, `` Sellout! Sellout!'' But another section applauded the vote to pay the fine, drawing a quick response from <LOCATION> Wasicsko </LOCATION>. The fine payment came at a time where local support of the opposition to Sand's plan was starting to wane. `` We've done all we can. We went to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> and did n't get anywhere,'' said <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Knetter </PERSON>, 65, a northeast <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION> resident `` There's no garbage pickup. There might not be any police protection. It may be time to wise up.'' <PERSON> Knetter </PERSON> spoke for an increasing number of local residents whose ardent opposition to low-income housing has dwindled as the harsh realities of Sand's stiff fines began hitting home. Phone lines at <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> were jammed this week with callers urging one of the adamant councilmen to change their vote, <PERSON> Wasicsko </PERSON> said. Uncollected garbage sits outside many homes; children going to school have no crossing guards; the three town libraries were to close Saturday. `` They're -LRB- <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION> residents -RRB- saying to the councilmen more and more, ` Hey, look, we give up. Just get this thing solved,''' said Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>. The fines _ which began at $ 100 per day, doubling daily until hitting a $ 1 million-a-day cap on Friday _ forced the state <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> to impose a `` Doomsday Plan'' aimed at providing public safety services while delaying bankruptcy. Phase One would have kicked in on Saturday, with 447 of the city's 1,834 employees receiving layoffs notices as part of a $ 20 million savings package. The <ORGANIZATION> Parks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recreation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> would close, while the <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> would be slashed to two employees. Other layoffs would come from the departments of real estate, civil service, fiscal services and public works. Control board Chairwoman <PERSON> Gail </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaffer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s secretary of state, said the cuts were designed to keep <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION> solvent until 1989. Sand, who in 1985 ruled the city had practiced segregation in housing and education for 40 years, imposed the fines after the four councilmen refused to implement part of his plan. City schools were desegregated under a Sand-approved plan, and the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> initially agreed to build 1,000 units of low-income housing in January. They reversed field on the housing at an Aug. 1 meeting, prompting Sand to impose fines which would double every day. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> upheld Sand's fines on appeal, but placed the $ 1 million cap on the amount.

 After nearly 1 -LCB- weeks of preparation and preliminaries in this seaside resort community, 51 contestants are ready to find out tonight who will reign as Miss America 1989. Miss <PERSON> Utah </PERSON> <PERSON> Sophia </PERSON> <PERSON> Christine </PERSON> <PERSON> Symko </PERSON> played a classical piano rhapsody and Miss <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> <PERSON> Aggeles </PERSON> wore a simple, white `` supersuit'' to victory Friday night in the last preliminary round of the 62nd Miss America Pageant. The 10 women who have accumulated the most points in preliminary swimsuit, talent and evening gown contests and interviews with the judges compete to succeed Miss America 1988 <PERSON> Kaye </PERSON> <PERSON> Lani </PERSON> <PERSON> Rae </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafko </PERSON>. The 10 finalists start with a clean slate in tonight's judging. Miss Symko, 21, of <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, offered selections from composer <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Liszt </PERSON>'s difficult `` Spanish Rhapsody,'' showing the piano prowess she developed in 17 years of study. She said she was pleased with her playing. `` Of course, it's not flawless, but I was very happy. I had a lot of fun with this.'' Miss <PERSON> Symko </PERSON> said she selected the piece because it was both formal and fun. Miss <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, born in <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, is a graduate student at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> pursuing her masters in physics. She plans to attend medical school. Miss Aggeles, a 5-foot-8, 128-pound brunette who once was `` quite the tomboy'' wore a white competition supersuit, the now-traditional, custom-designed suit said to hide flaws and enhance assets. She was the second contestant to wear a white supersuit to victory this week. Miss Aggeles, 24, credited her success to a six-month rigorous training regime. `` All the hard work paid off,'' she said. In addition to weight training, <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Aggeles </PERSON> said she stuck to a rigid diet that actually caused her to gain 12 pounds. `` I was too skinny,'' she said. Asked if she had done anything unnatural to enhance her figure, <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Aggeles </PERSON> laughed and said, `` I'm real.'' The 24-year-old from <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, graduated in 1987 from <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. She hopes eventually to receive a masters degree in fine arts from <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, specializing in classics and film, and aspires to a career on Broadway and in film. In the meantime, as <LOCATION> Miss </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> she hopes to implement a program to reduce the number of high school dropouts called `` School is Cool.'' Winners of the preliminary swimsuit competitions earlier this week were Miss <PERSON> Louisiana </PERSON> <PERSON> Valerie </PERSON> <PERSON> Brosset </PERSON> and Miss Mississippi <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Haag </PERSON>, while the preliminary talent winners were Miss <PERSON> Oklahoma </PERSON> <PERSON> Lori </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON> and Miss Minnesota <PERSON> Gretchen </PERSON> <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>. The top evening gown contestants have been kept secret to heighten the suspense for the televised finals. The preliminary awards carry scholarships: $ 3,500 in the talent division and $ 2,500 in the swimsuit competition.

<TEXT>
 After a month battling fires, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gearhart </PERSON> would like nothing more than a break. But he does n't expect one as the worst fires in <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION>'s history burn `` We're real tired, that's for sure,'' <PERSON> Gearhart </PERSON> said Friday while on the fire line near the tiny community of Silver Gate, which has been under seige by blazes for a week. `` We could still go on, but we've been away a long time,'' he said. `` We'd like to go home for just a few days, and then they could bring us back.'' <PERSON> Gearhart </PERSON>, a member of the Vista Grande Hot Shots from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernadino </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, has been on the line 35 days. Normally firefighters are released for several days after 21 days. But these are not normal times. More than 800,000 acres in nearby <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> have burned. The 151,000-acre Storm Creek-Hellroaring fire, one of several in and around the park, persists in threatening Silver Gate and <LOCATION> Cooke </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> northeast of the park. Firefighters see no sign of an improvement, with high winds forecast over the weekend that are expected to fan the flames. `` We are anticipating major fire activity,'' forest service official <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Avery </PERSON> said, adding that today `` may be the worst day since this entire episode began.'' Today was to have been the day <PERSON> Gearhart </PERSON> got a day off. But then, so was Friday _ until Friday came. `` Now that this is a national emergency, maybe they'll keep us even longer,'' he said. As a `` hot shot'' <PERSON> Gearhart </PERSON> and his fellow crew members are the first on the lines of the most dangerous sections of fire. He works 12-16 hours a day wielding a chain saw with a blade roughly 4 feet long, and sometimes has to hike 5 miles to reach the lines. The smoke and ash that <PERSON> Gearhart </PERSON> breathes have left their mark on his sooty face. As he walked along <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 212 on Friday, his sagging shoulders and slow gait showed his weariness. But despite the hardships, he was n't about to call it quits. `` We ca n't pack it in,'' he said. `` We have people that work for the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> full time, it's their job. `` It is our job,'' he added. `` We said we'd do it, you ca n't really complain because we knew this could happen. While there has been dispute over whether the thousands of firefighters are actually fighting the flames or merely managing their direction, <PERSON> Gearhart </PERSON> said he and his co-workers are doing their best under poor conditions. When the fire's flames get to be 300 feet high, `` the fire can do whatever it wants,'' he said. `` We're up against something that you really ca n't put out very easily without weather cooperation,'' he said. `` We're basically fighting -LRB- the fires -RRB- the way you have to do it, but it's just not working out.'' In his month on the <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> fire lines, <PERSON> Gearhart </PERSON> has gotten used to the danger of the work but has n't forgotten who comes first. `` It's just trees and brush -LRB- burning -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Gearhart </PERSON> said. `` They'll grow back, we wo n't. You just have to get out of the way sometimes and let it do its thing.''

<HEAD>Vietnamese Experts Arrive To Help Investigate Crash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Investigators today examined the wreckage of a Vietnamese jetliner to try to determine what caused the plane to crash minutes before its scheduled landing. Seventy-five people, including some government officials, were killed. One of the pilots of <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vietnam </ORGANIZATION> Flight 831 reported it was struck by lightning, said <PERSON> Tran </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Viet </PERSON>, third secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Vietnamese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>. The pilot, <PERSON> Khong </PERSON> <PERSON> Din </PERSON> <PERSON> Phuong </PERSON>, was the only one of the six survivors who was conscious. The Soviet-made Tu-134 slammed into a rice field four miles short of <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>'s airport Friday and blew up. The crash occurred during a thunderstorm, three minutes before the jet was scheduled to land after a flight from <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>. Vietnamese investigators flew to <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> to help <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> officials in the probe. Voice and flight recorders were retrieved from the wreckage, said Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Sopol </PERSON> <PERSON> Savigamin </PERSON>, a regional police commander. The cockpit recorder contains conversation between the crew and the airport control tower, and the flight recorder contains flight data. The passenger list included 50 Vietnamese, 11 Indians, eight Poles, three Japanese, three Frenchmen, two Finns, two Swedes, one Burmese and two others of unknown nationality. That totals 82, but one person did not board the plane. <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Quan </PERSON>, a Vietnamese Embassy official, said the dead included <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s Minister of <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Dang </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoi </PERSON> <PERSON> Huan </PERSON>, and its ambassador-designate to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Dhuong </PERSON> <PERSON> Vu </PERSON>, who was on the way to take up his post. <PERSON> Quan </PERSON> said other Vietnamese victims included many lower-ranking government officials on their way to conferences in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and other countries. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s ambassador to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arun </PERSON> <PERSON> Patwardhan </PERSON>, 48, was killed along with seven other officials of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> embassy, an Indian consular officer in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> said. The Japanese Embassy in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> said the second secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Japanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kiyokata </PERSON> <PERSON> Ida </PERSON>, and two Japanese businessmen were killed. Details on other victims were not available. <PERSON> Sopol </PERSON> said workers retrieved 75 bodies Friday. A Frenchman, a Polish woman, the pilot and three other Vietnamese remained in intensive care at <LOCATION> Bhumibol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. Hundreds of police, air force workers and volunteers hauled bodies from a rice paddy, wrapping them in the thin beige-colored cloth. The last two bodies, those of a man and a woman, were found lying by lily pads after workers pumped the pond dry. Scattered over the area were earrings, a shell necklace, toy plastic gun, seat cushions, backpacks, passports and more than 10 bags of diplomatic mail for the Australian Embassy in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>. The twin-engine Tu-134 is the Vietnamese flag carrier's mainstay aircraft. According to <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>'s All <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION>'s Aircraft, Tu-134s seat from 80 to 96 people. Vietnamese officials have said they would like to switch to Boeings, Airbuses and other newer, Western-made planes but do not have the money.

Flag-waving thousands thundered when the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> candidate proclaimed in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> that he's questioning the judgment _ not the patriotism _ of his Democratic rival. `` In just 60 days we can choose a president who will enforce civil rights laws, not veto them,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S.A. </ORGANIZATION>, a large, predominantly black religious group, in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> Friday. He also advocated giving Old Glory another star: Statehood for the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' talks earlier this week often seemed flat and attracted generally lukewarm applause. But this time he spoke like a preacher at a revival and drew one of the best receptions of his campaign. Over and over, he told the crowd the election is only 60 days away. And from the crowd, comprised largely of black ministers, came loud shouts: `` Just 60 days.'' Moments earlier, the group heard <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> urge them to `` accept my recommendation'' and join him, a former rival for the Democratic nomination, in backing <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on Election Day. `` He can be trusted to help keep hope alive,'' said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who slapped at <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and GOP ticketmate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. `` Why do I support <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>? Why do I ask you to go and support him with fervor? Because <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> does not care and <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> does not understand. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> cares and understands,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> added. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, swinging through <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> in search of their crucial electoral votes, hammered at <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on defense issues Friday. He accused the Democrat of contradictions and confusion about the fate of the <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Initiative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> _ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wars </ORGANIZATION> _ when <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> vacates the White House. `` Calling it a fantasy one day, something he wo n't rule out the next ... suggests a confusion in my view on the basic facts, a confusion in terms of what he really believes and where he would take this country,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told a group of Republican women in <LOCATION> Rockford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> suggested Republican attacks on him are similar to <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>'s accusations and other controversial tactics in earlier eras `` Just as they did to -LRB- President -RRB- <LOCATION> Franklin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Roosevelt </LOCATION> and -LRB- House Speaker -RRB- <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Rayburn </PERSON>, they're now attacking my patriotism,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` And just as they did in the 1930s and 1950s, the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people can smell the garbage,'' he added. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s audience at a flag-waving rally in <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, roared when the vice president said: `` I understand that today the liberal governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> attacked me for questioning the patriotism, his patriotism. I'm not questioning his patriotism. I'm questioning his judgment. While <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> returned to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for a weekend away from the campaign trail, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was back in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> to study defense issues before dealing with military and foreign policy matters in speeches next week. Three of the Democrats' chief defense experts in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> _ Sens. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, and Rep. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> _ arranged meetings with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> today and Sunday, said <PERSON> Dayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' press secretary. Top aides, developing plans for a pair of presidential debates, agreed Friday that the second round between <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will be in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, said the Democrat's campaign chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON>. <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign leader <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> had decided earlier to have round one in <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, on Sept. 25, with the second debate either Oct. 13 or Oct. 14 _ depending on the American League baseball playoff series. Both debates are expected to be general in subject matter. Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, pounded at the Republicans on labor issues Friday in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, and also took the 60-day theme. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> joined in a Democratic roast of the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION>'s opposition to legislation that requires giving workers 60 days notice of plant closings or large-scale layoffs. Democrats around the country passed out pink slips, saying they were putting the Republicans on notice their days in office are numbered. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> told a cheering crowd at a union hall in <LOCATION> Bloomington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>: `` We're here today to give the Republicans a better break than they give the American worker.'' `` Sure, we could provide notice the Republican way. We could go there election eve and change the locks on the door,'' said <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. `` We could take the vice president's <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> mess card and cancel that. And we could take away <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> II. But we agree with the vast majority of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people who say 60 days' notice is fair. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, meantime, said Friday he got into law school `` fair and square'' _ not through an affirmative action program aimed at helping minorities. `` No rules were broken,'' he added. Earlier Friday, The -LRB- <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> -RRB- Plain Dealer reported the admissions program <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> went through in 1970 was intended to offer equal opportunity to members of minority groups, the economically disadvantaged, and other `` students of different viewpoints and backgrounds.'' While <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was touring metals plants in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, his <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> office released financial records Friday showing he and his wife own assets worth an estimated $ 1.4 million.

 <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s ambassador turned in a toy gun and said it was the weapon brandished by a Vietnamese diplomat during a demonstration, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said. A Foreign Office official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Friday that Ambassador <PERSON> Tran </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Hung </PERSON> acknowledged there may also be a real gun in the embassy. The ambassador, who was summoned to the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, handed over the toy gun and was told to check whether there was a real gun and report back, the official said. Telephone calls seeking comment from the embassy were not answered Friday evening. On Thursday, the ambassador agreed to give up the diplomatic immunity of a third secretary who allegedly waved a gun at British-based Vietnamese refugees during a protest outside the embassy on Sunday. The demonstrators took photographs, which were published in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> has said it takes a very serious view of the incident and warned the ambassador this week of the `` gravest consequences'' unless the diplomat's immunity was waived. Third Secretary <PERSON> Khang </PERSON> <PERSON> Than </PERSON> <PERSON> Nhan </PERSON>, who is accused of brandishing the weapon, may now be questioned by police and, if necessary, charged or expelled. Diplomatic missions in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> not supposed to have weapons, and the government has taken violations seriously since a gunman firing from the Libyan Embassy killed a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> policewoman during a protest in April 1984.

<TEXT>
 The last hotels and campgrounds in fire-blackened <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> were closed as firefighters braced for high winds expected to create the worst wildfire conditions this summer. `` Our weather for the next few days is really what everything is going to hinge on,'' <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Avery </PERSON> said Friday. `` If we can get through the next 24 to 36 hours, we should be in good shape.'' Safety precautions were stepped up after a firefighter was killed by a falling tree in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> Friday, the first death directly attributed to the fires, and a helicopter disappeared in a rugged area of a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> forest. Park officials closed the Mammoth Hot Springs Inn, the last lodging open in the 2.2 million-acre park, as flames from a 222,000-acre fire came within 3 miles of the area. Winds pushed the fire to the north and northeast, skirting the area. Forecasters called for gusts to 60 mph today. Firefighters feared conditions would be worse than on Aug. 20, dubbed `` Black Saturday,'' when winds whipped flames into a 150,000-acre blaze through the park in a single day, fire officials said. `` -LRB- Today -RRB- may be the worst day since this entire episode began,'' <PERSON> Avery </PERSON> said. However, the winds herald the arrival of a storm front over <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> that could bring lower temperatures and scattered showers to <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> late tonight or Sunday. The top fire priority was a 263,000-acre blaze in the northeast quarter of the park and neighboring <ORGANIZATION> Shoshone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Avery </PERSON> said. About 9,000 firefighters and support personnel were sent Friday to the blazes in the <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> area that covered nearly 2 million acres in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. Officials were looking forward to the arrival of additional personnel and equipment from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> signed emergency legislation Friday clearing the way for <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> to send the aid to <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>. By Friday, 13 fires had burned almost 1.2 million acres in the <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> area. In the 2.2 million-acre park itself, 816,225 acres have burned. Fires also burned Friday in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. So far this year, 68,396 fires in the West have burned nearly 3.8 million acres, an area larger than <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, in what federal officials have called the worst fire season in 30 years. Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> and Undersecretary of Devense <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Taft </PERSON> IV planned to inspect the damage today during a visit to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mont </PERSON>. The group planned to talk with fire command staffers at <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>, tour Old Faithful geyser and fly over <ORGANIZATION> Cooke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Silver </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gate </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, where residents were twice evacuated, then hold a public meeting in <PERSON> Cody </PERSON>. Only the park's northern and western entrances remained open and visitors had free access to just 19 miles of road. Firefighters emphasized safety, posting one person in each crew to watch for falling trees, information officer <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Payne </PERSON> said following Friday's fatal accident. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON>, 26, a firefighter from <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON>'s Ferry, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, was killed when a burning tree fell on him and four companions, officials said. `` There are tons of snags in the area that are smoldering and do and can fall over at any time,'' <PERSON> Payne </PERSON> said. `` We do n't want any more injuries out there.'' In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state, a ground search was set for today for a private helicopter that disappeared Friday evening while helping fight the state's largest wildfire. The aircraft vanished after refueling and heading back toward the fire, said <LOCATION> Chelan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's dispatcher <PERSON> Bud </PERSON> <PERSON> Fritz </PERSON>. Officials did not know how many were aboard the two-seater Bell Jet Ranger, leased by the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION>, or what its mission was. However, they said it may have put down because of mechanical failure or approaching darkness. The helicopter's disappearance capped a difficult day for firefighters battling a 43,000-acre fire, which flared up and grew by 6,000 acres Friday afternoon. In <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, more than 3,000 firefighters are battling blazes that have scorched about 210,000 acres and remain out of control. In eastern <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, forest service officials mobilized an army of 700 firefighters for a weekend assault on an blaze that has blackened 16,600 acres of <ORGANIZATION> Ashley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>. Some 500 firefighters in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> fought to control blazes that have scorched more than 11,000 acres.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s former chairman and a business associate were secretly arrested for transporting stolen company documents sought by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> for use in its $ 500 million lawsuit against <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported today. <PERSON> Orin </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON> was arrested in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> in July after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Customs agents videotaped him telling a business associate to sell a pair of confidential 1979 Ashland memos to the Iranian government for $ 600,000, the newspaper said. The associate, <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Furmark </PERSON>, was also arrested in July, the Times said. The arrests were kept secret as authorities tried to pursue the Iranians involved in the incident, the newspaper said. Unidentified law enforcement officials told the Times that <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON> pleaded innocent after his arrest and was released. <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON>' attorneys, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollner </PERSON>, confirmed their client was arrested for interstate transportation of stolen property, the newspaper said. `` When all the facts are known, <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON> will be totally exonerated,'' said a statement released by a third <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON> attorney, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lang </PERSON>. According to papers filed in federal court in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, two other people were charged with interstate transportation of stolen property: ex-Ashland vice president <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Dugan </PERSON> and attorney <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnett </PERSON>, whose late father did legal work for <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION>. Both pleaded innocent, the Times said. The lawsuit stems from oil contracts between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION>. Part of it focused on seven Iranian oil tankers which <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> acquired but did not pay for during the oil crunch of 1979. The federal probe began after <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION>, concerned over reports of stolen documents for sale, hired private investigators to check into the allegations, the Times said.

<TEXT>
 Heavy rains today exacerbated flood conditions in <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, causing swelling of major rivers that were already well above flood level, officials said. Officials at flood control centers told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that flooding worsened in 12 districts where, earlier in the week, the water level of major rivers had been receding. The floods have covered three-quarters of <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> and left one-fourth of its 110 million people homeless. <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> newspapers put the death toll from flooding at 1,402. The government's count remained at 609 and is considered far too low. The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> on Friday said the floods had claimed 637 lives. Officials reported an outbreak of diarrhea in all areas affected by the floods. By Friday evening at least 160,872 people had been afflicted by the illness and 102 had died from it, the officials said. In <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>, a city of 6 million, 21,412 new cases of diarrhea were reported Friday by the government health center. The rains Friday and early today added to hardships already suffered by millions living on roofs and treetops and huddled together in thousands of camps nationwide without safe drinking water, cooked food or medical care. <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials said 30,035 health workers were working around the clock to aid victims of water-borne diseases. The officials acknowledged, however, that there was not enough medicine to help all those affected by the flooding. Millions of gallons of raw sewage and tons of garbage dumped into floodwaters in <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> posed a serious medical threat to the capital's population, a senior official at the <ORGANIZATION> Dhaka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Municipal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said. He said the <LOCATION> Buriganga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, which carried all the city's sewage, was now mixing with the floodwater. Health officials have estimated that 40 million gallons of raw sewage a day are being dumped into stagnating floodwaters where children swim for fun and adults wade to food markets and relief centers. A senior official at the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said that `` if the water does not recede in the next couple of days, most of the rice crop will be damaged beyond any recovery.'' The government has 1.3 million tons of grain and has issued an appeal for 3 million tons to compensate for damage to the rice crop.

<BYLINE>Radicals Demonstrating Against Olympics Clash With Police
^By BARRY RENFREW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Radical students yelling `` Oppose dictatorial Olympics!'' hurled hundreds of firebombs at riot police today. Student leaders charged the Games were being used to cement military rule. About 2,000 students from several <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> colleges rallied at the capital's <ORGANIZATION> Yonsei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, denouncing the Olympics, President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON>'s government and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for backing the government. `` Down with military dictatorship,'' the students chanted as they marched around the campus with red, white and blue flags. The students, some armed with wooden and iron clubs, then marched out of the school to confront hundreds of riot police who were surrounding the campus. Protesters taunted the police and then attacked. Waves of masked students rushed out of the school's gates and climbed over walls to pelt police with firebombs that exploded in orange balls of blazing gasoline. The firebombs exploded among the police, setting fire to troopers' shields and clothing. Police, dressed in green combat fatigues and black visored helmets, did not use tear gas because of government orders not to use the powerful gas during the Olympics. They also hurled back fewer rocks than in similar protests in the past. Police said they had no reports of arrests or injuries. The clash lasted about 30 minutes and was confined to the highway in front of the school. Student and dissident leaders speaking at the rally charged the <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> government with using the Olympics, which begin Sept. 17, to cement authoritarian rule. `` The Olympics are being used to cement the fascist regime,'' said a statement by the protesters. `` The regime is making all out efforts to weaken the people's power.'' Speakers charged the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> with conspiring with <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> to continue military rule. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has about 42,000 troops in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> under a mutual defense pact. Radical leaders have called for anti-Olympic protests, but the protests so far have been confined to a few campuses in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> and several other cities. There have been no demonstrations near Olympic sites. The radicals, a small but powerful minority on campuses, have virtually no public support. Most Koreans are critical of protests against the Olympics and want nothing to disrupt the Games. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>, a former general who won presidential elections in December, has introduced broad democratic reforms and dismantled authoritarian controls.

<HEAD>Yonkers City Council Approves Housing Desegregation Plan, Ending
Fines</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JUDIE GLAVE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>YONKERS, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Yonkers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> reversed itself and approved a court-ordered housing desegregation plan today, backing down in the face of $ 1 million-a-day fines, threatened layoffs of city workers and a shift in public opinion. Two of the four councilmen long opposed to the plan relented when confronted with the prospect of garbage rotting on the sidewalks, closed libraries and skeleton crews of firefighters and police. The 5-to-2 vote came at about 1:30 a.m. after a day of meetings in which pressure grew to resolve the weeks-old crisis. It followed a raucous City Hall session before about 100 spectators in which hard-liners condemned politicians who supported the plan. `` In the past we have thought of those fines somewhat in the abstract. The abstract has now become a reality,'' said <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Longo </PERSON>, one of the two councilmen who changed their vote. `` The thing that most affected me was looking over a list of people who, at the stroke of midnight, would become unemployed.' In long speeches before the vote, <PERSON> Longo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Chema </PERSON>, the second councilman who changed his position, said they reached agreement Friday with the plaintiffs to modify the plan. The councilmen said they realized <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Sand </PERSON> would not agree to the changes unless the councilmen changed their votes. The modifications worked out between the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advancement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colored </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> and the councilmen must be approved by Sand, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the federal <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>. Sand, who ordered the end to segregated housing in <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION> three years ago, was to determine if the city must pay Friday's fine, the first million-dollar penalty. City attorney <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickelle </PERSON>, speaking before the vote, said it was his understanding that if the council approved the plan at the session that began Friday night, the city would not have to pay Thursday's or Friday's fines. Mayor <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wasicsko </PERSON> said he received a message early today from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> Gail </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaffer </PERSON>, head of the state <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, that the layoffs had been rescinded. The board had taken control of the city's finances and devised a `` doomsday'' budget. The desegregation lawsuit was brought by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in 1980 and joined by the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION>. The councilmen's speeches, however, failed to persuade some opponents of the housing plan. `` You little snake,'' one woman yelled at Chema. `` You sold us out, <PERSON> Nicky </PERSON>! We'll remember!'' a man yelled at <LOCATION> Wasicsko </LOCATION>, who supported the plan. The fines had started at $ 100 and doubled each day, reaching $ 819,200 Thursday for a total of $ 1,638,300. In addition to Friday's $ 1 million fine, the city was to begin laying off hundreds of city workers today under the state-mandated budget. Sand ruled Aug. 2 that the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> suburb of 194,000 was in contempt of court for the council's refusal to carry out a housing-desegregation plan it approved earlier this year. The plan calls for 200 units of low-income public housing scattered throughout mainly white neighborhoods and 800 units of middle-income subsidized housing scattered throughout <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION>. The modified plan would reduce the number of stand-alone townhouses and establish a non-profit agency to manage the low-income units rather than have them managed by the <ORGANIZATION> Municipal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Longo </PERSON> said. Councilmen <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Spallone </PERSON> and <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Fagan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> continued to vote against the housing plan. The vote came as support for the opposition to Sand's plan began to wane. `` We've done all we can. We went to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> and did n't get anywhere,'' said resident <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Knetter </PERSON>, 65 `` There's no garbage pickup. There might not be any police protection. It may be time to wise up.'' Phone lines at <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> were jammed this week with callers urging the recalcitrant councilmen to change their votes. Sand, who ruled in 1985 the city had practiced segregation in housing and education for 40 years, imposed the fines after the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> voted 4-3 against implementing the housing plan. City schools were desegregated under a Sand-approved plan, and the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> initially agreed to build 1,000 units of low-income housing in January. They reversed on the housing at an Aug. 1 meeting, prompting Sand to impose the fines. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Sept. 1 upheld Sand's fines on appeal, but also upheld a $ 1 million-a-day cap imposed by an appeals court. Sand also imposed personal fines of $ 500 a day on the dissenting councilmen, but the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> suspended the penalties.

<HEAD>Task Force Proposes Allowing Chinese To Visit Taiwan</HEAD>

 A government task force today proposed easing a 39-year-old travel ban so residents of Communist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> can come to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> to visit sick relatives, officials said. The Cabinet task force proposed that mainland Chinese be allowed to enter <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> to visit spouses, parents or children who are gravely ill or seriously injured, a Government Information Office statement said. The trips would be restricted to two months. Visits to attend funerals of close relatives also would be allowed, the statement said. The proposal will be submitted soon to Premier <PERSON> Yu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuo-hwa </PERSON> for approval, it said. The task force, headed by Vice Premier <PERSON> Shih </PERSON> <PERSON> Chi-yang </PERSON>, was established last month to map out Nationalist policies toward <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The Chinese Nationalist government and about 2 million supporters fled to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> in 1949 after losing a civil war to Communist forces on the Chinese mainland. Many of the people who fled to this island left close relatives behind. Nationalist authorities banned all official contact with the Communist government in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> but last year eased a ban on travel to the Chinese mainland to allow <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> residents to visit relatives. Mainland Chinese who have been members of the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> or have taken part in `` any seditious groups'' would still be banned from entering <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, according to the proposal.

<HEAD>Authorities: Man Tried to Kill Wife Two Years After Slaying
Sister-in-Law</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A man accused of raping and killing his sister-in-law because `` women flaunt their bodies'' dug the teen-ager's grave two days before she was slain, and planned a similar fate for his wife, authorities say. `` I'll make you disappear just like <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Lenz </PERSON> -RRB- disappeared,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weber </PERSON> told his wife, <PERSON> Emily </PERSON>, according to a criminal complaint by Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnett </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Weber </PERSON>, who said she was struck 20 times with a shovel, was in serious condition at a hospital Friday. <PERSON> Weber </PERSON>, 24, was charged in <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in this northern <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> city Friday with first-degree murder, first-degree sexual assault, kidnapping, false imprisonment and attempted first-degree murder. <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> was set at $ 200,000. <PERSON> Weber </PERSON> prepared a grave for his wife and forced her to write letters explaining her absence, Price County authorities said. The skeletal remains of Miss <PERSON> Lenz </PERSON>, a 17-year-old high school senior who disappeared in November 1986, were found in a grave in the woods Wednesday. Authorities looked for the remains after they happened on a tape recording describing the death of <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenz </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Weber </PERSON>'s sister, while investigating a report <PERSON> Weber </PERSON> had beaten his wife. <PERSON> Weber </PERSON> planned to use the tape to terrify his wife, according to a criminal complaint filed by <PERSON> Barnett </PERSON>. The recording said the teen-ager died because `` women flaunt their bodies and think they can get anything they want.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Weber </PERSON> `` wo n't be the last,'' it said. `` There will be others, many others.'' The complaint said that, as <PERSON> Weber </PERSON> beat his wife, he was surprised she kept getting up, and told her `` you're going to be a tough one to kill.'' The remains found Wednesday in the township of Flambeau were identified as Miss <PERSON> Lenz </PERSON>'s through dental records. According to the complaint, <PERSON> Weber </PERSON> provided investigators with a map to the grave and asked that she be given a Christian burial. The cause of the girl's death was not determined, Sheriff <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Wirsing </PERSON> said. If convicted, <PERSON> Weber </PERSON> could be sentenced to life in prison plus 100 years, <PERSON> Barnett </PERSON> said.

 <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Encalade </PERSON> was philosophical about <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION>, the hurricane that chased him from his home exactly 23 years after an equally rude uprooting at the hands of Hurricane Betsy. As he sat among 1,200 other evacuees at <ORGANIZATION> Belle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chasse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> just south of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> on Friday night, the 69-year-old <PERSON> Encalade </PERSON> said living through storms is a way of life. `` People live all their lives down here,'' he said. `` You hate to leave. You go somewhere else and a tornado will take you or something else will. `` It's discouraging, but what are you going to do?'' he said. `` If you're too old, you ca n't go far.'' <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION> was at hurricane strength Friday when the evacuees left their low-lying homes, but lost its punch as it brushed the coast and was downgraded to a tropical storm this morning. Thousands of residents of coastal areas in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> also took refuge in shelters and homes of relatives and friends on higher ground. Despite an almost casual acceptance of his situation, <PERSON> Encalade </PERSON> said previous storms have cost him dearly. `` When <PERSON> Camille </PERSON> -LRB- in 1969 -RRB- and <PERSON> Betsy </PERSON> came over, they cleaned us out. I lost two houses,'' he said. Now Encalade lives in a trailer in <LOCATION> Buras </LOCATION> on the tip of the <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>. `` We've got it anchored,'' he said. `` But if the storm passes over it's going to take it anyway. So you just lock it up and come up here and see what happens.'' At the school, cots were set up in the gym, with large families grouped in classrooms. Some people brought TV sets and suitcases with changes of clothes. Sitting on cots, <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Melodia </PERSON> <PERSON> Buras </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Boothville </LOCATION> were a little more pragmatic than Encalade. `` I've been in this school three times already,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Buras </PERSON> said. `` Once for <PERSON> Betsy </PERSON> and once for <PERSON> Camille </PERSON>. When it's a hurricane, I'm gone.'' They said they normally ride out weaker storms at home, but anytime a hurricane nears shore they head for higher ground. Mrs. <PERSON> Buras </PERSON> said her quick departures when bad weather threatens sometimes draw jokes from neighbors. `` They laugh at us when we get back, but I'd rather be safe.'' Many shared the same outlook at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bernard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> east of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, where 170 evacuees took refuge. `` Where we live is ` God's Little Acre,''' said <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzales </PERSON>, 65, of <LOCATION> Delcroix </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. `` It's the best place to live even though every time a storm comes through, we've got to go.'' So why not move? `` If our home's destroyed, we'll make another government loan and build again,'' she said.

<TEXT>
 A lawsuit that seeks to redress alleged discrimination against <PERSON> Hispanics </PERSON> will represent a fundamental reordering of political priorities in the nation's most populous county, Hispanic leaders say. The suit, filed this week by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, alleges that county officials discriminated against Hispanics by drawing political boundaries so as to dilute the influence of Hispanic voters. `` It should have happened years ago,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>, 55, president of a thriving grocery business who was the first Mexican-American to serve on the city's <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commissioners </ORGANIZATION>. `` I'm just so excited about it.'' <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> predicted that changing the electoral districts would lead to higher voter turnout because of the likelihood that Hispanic candidates will run for the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supervisors </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> and others said they expect redistricting will result in changes in county government services, particularly in health care, zoning, police protection and social services. A similar <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> case against the city government in 1985 resulted in redrawn boundaries in which Hispanics comprise a majority in at least three of the city's 15 council districts. Hispanic leaders say far more is at stake in the county redistricting case. For one thing, no Hispanic or any other minority group member has ever been elected to the county Board of Supervisors. Yet the percentage of Hispanics in the county is at least 27 percent, with blacks comprising more than 12 percent and Asians about 5.8 percent, according to the lawsuit. `` Without a doubt, at least in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supervisors </ORGANIZATION> is one of the most powerful elected bodies in government,'' said City Councilman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Alatorre </PERSON>. `` Being elected to the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supervisors </ORGANIZATION> is like being elected pope,'' <PERSON> Alatorre </PERSON> said. `` They're the five gods.'' `` I call them the five kings, and a lot of people call them the five kings because of their imperial manner,'' said <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON>, a state civil rights representative for the <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Latin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION>. Such an appraisal is due in large part to the sheer size of county government. The Board of Supervisors controls a budget of nearly $ 9 billion, compared to the city's budget of roughly $ 3.5 billion. The county's population, estimated at 8.5 million, is greater than that in each of 42 states. Roughly translated, that means that each of the five supervisors has a constituency of 1.6 million to 1.7 million people. In comparison, the ideal population set for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Congressional Districts during the reapportionment of the early 1980s was a mere 526,000. And at 2,615 square miles, the county's 5th District seat in northern <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> is bigger than the state of <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>. Such huge numbers, <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> said, means that immense power is concentrated in the hands of a very few. Conversely, <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> added, mounting a political challenge against an incumbent supervisor requires tremendous financial resources. Striking a conciliatory tone, <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supervisors </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Deane </PERSON> <PERSON> Dana </PERSON> said the suit has left the five-member board with little choice `` except to redraw our lines.'' Hispanic community leaders sounded ecstatic about the prospects of change to be wrought by the voting rights case. `` Hispanic groups have experienced a ` tough guy' kind of attitude from the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supervisors </ORGANIZATION> when they protested over clinics that have been closed,'' said City Councilwoman <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON> <PERSON> Molina </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s intervention, <PERSON> Ms. </PERSON> <PERSON> Molina </PERSON> said, is `` sending a tremendously positive message to a Hispanic community that felt they had no place to go in terms of political redress.'' <PERSON> Ms. </PERSON> <PERSON> Molina </PERSON>, who was elected to represent east <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> in February 1987, was one of the first politicians to benefit from the city's redistricting case, and she believes that she has brought important changes to the council. `` Having a Hispanic on the City Council has created kind of an attitude change,'' <PERSON> Ms. </PERSON> <PERSON> Molina </PERSON> said. `` Before, there were many issues that were not addressed.''

 Lt. Gov. S.B. Woo and civic activist <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Beard </PERSON> faced off in a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> primary today to determine who will try to unseat Republican <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>. Voter turnout was critical in today's race, the only statewide competition in the primary. Volunteers from both camps planned to canvass door-to-door and by telephone, as well as provide transportation to the polls. A light turnout was expected to favor <PERSON> Beard </PERSON>, who was backed by unions and party regulars who traditionally go to the polls in force. A heavy turnout was considered good for Woo, whose main support comes from college students and younger groups. Polls opened at 7 a.m. and were to close at 8 p.m. `` We're making sure we're real well-organized and getting our people out,'' Woo's deputy campaign manager, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Markell </PERSON>, said Friday. A poll conducted late last month for the <ORGANIZATION> Wilmington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-Journal </ORGANIZATION> newspapers gave Woo 45 percent of the vote and Beard 31 percent. Twenty-four percent of the likely voters polled were undecided. Woo, a 51-year-old physics professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION>, was elected lieutenant governor four years ago in his first bid for public office. A native of <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, he became a symbol of success by Asian-Americans. Woo was considered a shoo-in for another term as lieutenant governor, but instead chose to challenge <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>, who is seeking his fourth term. However, Democrats complained <PERSON> Woo </PERSON> is not loyal to the party and threw their support behind Beard. Beard, 49, is a former staffer of the late Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N </LOCATION>. He owns a non-profit company that helps obtain grants to attract economic devleopment. Woo apparently won the battle for campaign donations. By late August, he had raised $ 407,998, with most of the money from the Asian-American community. Beard raised $ 65,008. <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>, who runs unopposed in the primary, had $ 734,933.

 Tropical storm <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION> whipped the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> with severe winds today and spread rain as far north as southern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. The storm's strength diminished, and it was downgraded from hurricane status as it passed by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> and headed for <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 About 50 people attended the first showing of the controversial film, `` The Last Temptation of Christ,'' after a federal judge blocked a first-in-the-nation county ordinance banning theaters from showing it. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Vinson </PERSON> issued a preliminary injunction Friday to stop enforcement of the ordinance, saying it was unconstitutional. <PERSON> Vinson </PERSON> added that `` red flags should run up'' whenever government tries to violate the rights of citizens. The ordinance had called for a maximum penalty of up to a $ 500 fine and 60 days in jail for showing the film. About a dozen pickets were at the Plaza III Theaters for the movie's debut Friday, but there was no violence. In their complaint against the ordinance, the movie's director, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scorsese </PERSON>, and <ORGANIZATION> Plitt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theaters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Escambia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> was the first local government to ban the film outright, although others have passed resolutions opposing it. County commissioners passed the ordinance on a 4-1 vote Thursday on the advice of County Attorney <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Buztrey </PERSON>, after <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> fundamentalists and a group called <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pornography </ORGANIZATION> asked for the ban. Opponents objected to the film's humanizing of Christ, particularly a scene in which he has a sexual fantasy involving <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Magdalene </PERSON>. <PERSON> Buztrey </PERSON> argued against the injunction, contending the film was pornographic and patently offensive to the majority of citizens in the county. `` It may be acceptable in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, but it is n't acceptable in <LOCATION> Escambia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>,'' he said. But <PERSON> Vinson </PERSON> listened to a tape recording of the emergency meeting and said he heard no arguments concerning either obscenity or violence. The only argument made by commissioners or citizens who spoke at the meeting was that the film was sacreligious. <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, a lawyer representing the director and theater company, cited rulings by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> that it is not the business of government to suppress real or imagined attacks on a particular religion. <PERSON> Vinson </PERSON> agreed the case was virtually identical to ones in which the high court has disallowed prior restraint of free speech or expression.

 President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said his government is willing to meet in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> with Contra rebels to discuss resuming high-level peace talks aimed at ending the civil war. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said Friday that Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> would go to <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> `` to discuss with a <LOCATION> Contra </LOCATION> delegation a next meeting in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> and to hear their concerns -LRB- and -RRB- fears are about coming to <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>.'' The president said in a speech that the preliminary talks should take place Sept. 19-20 in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. `` I would like to have the cable in my hand before I reply. I came from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> yesterday, this is the first news I have,'' Nicaraguan Resistance director <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> said from his home in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> today. A cease-fire in the 7-year-old civil war between the U.S.-backed rebels and the leftist Sandinistas began March 21. But high-level negotiations in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> on a permanent truce broke down on June 9. Contra leaders claimed the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> restricted their freedom of movement in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> and said future talks must be held in another Central American country. The government has extended the cease-fire on a monthly basis, most recently to Sept. 30. The rebels say they will abide by the truce indefinitely, but each side has accused the other of violations. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said he suggested the preliminary talks in conversations with Guatemalan President <PERSON> Vinicio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cerezo </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> also said conditions existed for a new summit of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> presidents in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> to evaluate progress in implementing a regional peace plan signed by the leaders in August 1987. The leaders of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> last met in January. The presidents would `` make decisions on the next steps that can be taken to strengthen this process,'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said, adding that he spoke by telephone with <ORGANIZATION> Cerezo </ORGANIZATION> and Costa Rican President <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> about such a summit meeting. The peace plan calls for democracy in the five countries, negotiated solutions to civil conflicts and political amnesties. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> won the 1987 Nobel Peace Prize for authoring the plan.

<TEXT>
 The scion of a wealthy Indian family made aviation history today when he finished a 6,000-mile journey from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> in an ultralight aircraft in 23 days. <PERSON> Vijaypat </PERSON> <PERSON> Singhania </PERSON> landed in his red and white L'Esprit d'Indian Post to loud applause at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Safdarjung </LOCATION> airport around noon. `` I wanted to be an ambassador for my country and show people <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> is not just a country of snake-charmers,'' he said. `` I was running out of stories to tell my grandchildren. Now I have a fund of tales.'' The 49-year-old millionaire, head of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s third largest business concern, faced high winds, sandstorms in the <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION> desert and hundreds of miles of open sea sitting for hours inside the cramped one-seat cockpit. <PERSON> Singhania </PERSON> beat a 34-day ultralight record set earlier this year by a British television journalist, <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Milton </PERSON>. <PERSON> Singhania </PERSON> finished the journey in 23 days, having left <LOCATION> Biggin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> on August 18. The plane weighs 330 pounds, the weight of a medium-sized motor-scooter, or, as <PERSON> Singhania </PERSON> said, `` the weight of an average couple.'' `` It belongs to the lightest possible category of aircraft,'' <ORGANIZATION> Aditya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dev </ORGANIZATION>, a pilot with <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, said. The name of the aircraft, <PERSON> Singhania </PERSON> said, was a combination of his `` two passions,'' the spirit of adventure and a Bombay-based daily newspaper owned by his family, The Indian Post. `` There have been only five long flights -LRB- above 5,000 miles -RRB- undertaken in a microlight aircraft,'' said <PERSON> Milton </PERSON>, who was at the airport to congratulate <PERSON> Singhania </PERSON>. `` Anyone who now attempts such a flight will have to beat <PERSON> Vijay </PERSON> to make the record.'' As he emerged from the 21-feet long aircraft waving a cap, <PERSON> Singhania </PERSON> was mobbed by hundreds of people who had gathered at the central Delhi airport. After being garlanded with flowers in a ritual of welcome, he was taken to a dais, presented mementos and praised for having `` done <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> proud.'' At a news conference later he described what had made him undertake the journey that was, by his own admission, gruelling. `` I lost more than 11 kilograms -LRB- 24 pounds -RRB- during the trip and have got countless heat sores from sitting cramped in the cockpit so long.'' `` Flying at 10,000 feet over the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>, my longest single non-stop spell of flying, I saw ships and tried to visualize how long it would take for them to pick me up if I fell in,'' <PERSON> Singhania </PERSON> said. `` I had a life-jacket strapped on, shark-repellent by my side and kept talking to my granddaughter's picture that was strapped to the front of the cockpit to prevent myself from going crazy.'' `` I kept my spirits up but let me tell you I was most relieved to see the shore at <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>,'' he said of the most arduous portion of the flight. `` My most thrilling moment was this morning, when I landed at <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>. I knew I had come to the end of the journey and that I had established the record.'' But the aviator did not seem ready to go on to further flying successes. `` I want to sleep for four straight days before I even think of flying again,'' he said. `` I never plan to repeat the feat.''

 A time bomb exploded in a crowded bazaar of this frontier city today, and a military officer said 17 people were injured. The bomb was attached to a drinking water tank in the city's main shopping area, said an army explosives expert, Maj. <PERSON> Ghulam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussain </PERSON> It went off around 1:15 p.m, shattering windows, damaging two cars and shaking central <LOCATION> Peshawar </LOCATION>. The Khyber bazaar is a grimy, cinderblock warren of merchants and a main transit point for buses, taxis and three-wheeled rickshaws. No group claimed responsibility for the blast, but officials have routinely blamed such acts on agents of neighboring <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s communist government. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> supports Moslem guerrillas fighting the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government and an estimated 50,000 Soviet troops who support it.

 Hurricane <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION> lashed the Gulf Coast with 80 mph winds and sheets of rain, trapping four men on a barge and forcing thousands of people to head inland for safety, but quickly weakened to a tropical depression. `` It was a small storm, but I do n't care for any of them,'' said <PERSON> Luke </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrovich </PERSON>, president of <LOCATION> Plaquemines </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Parish </LOCATION> on the tip of the <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>. One death was linked to the storm, an <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> man who drowned Friday as he tried to secure a boat against the rising winds. But property damage was less than expected. The eye of the hurricane, about 30 miles wide, passed 30 miles east of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> around 3 a.m., then headed across <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pontchartrain </LOCATION>, slightly west of the predicted path over the city of <LOCATION> Slidell </LOCATION>. Two hours later, the highest sustained winds were clocked at 60 mph, and <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION> was downgraded to a tropical storm. By 5:30 a.m., the poorly defined remnants of the storm were just north of <LOCATION> Hammond </LOCATION>, moving toward <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>. At 8 a.m., the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hurricane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> downgraded <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION> to a tropical depression and discontinued all warnings, although it advised small craft to stay in port from <LOCATION> Morgan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Apalachicola </LOCATION>. Evacuation orders for <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> were lifted, allowing people to return home despite some high water. `` We're still watching the tides, particularly from the west, but we do n't think they will come up high enough to cause a problem,'' <PERSON> Petrovich </PERSON> said. Winds trailing the storm were expected to drive tides in the marshy regions around <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> as much as 9 feet above normal. The threat of tornadoes remained. Tornado watches were posted along the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> east to <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>. There were widespread power failures, including metropolitan <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, where about 30,000 people lost electricity. Power was knocked out to 7,000 people in <LOCATION> Plaquemeines </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Parish </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Petrovich </PERSON> said. There were no reports of major damage. At <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, a 32-year-old man who did n't know how to swim drowned Friday when he fell into <PERSON> Cotton </PERSON> <PERSON> Bayou </PERSON> as he tried to tie down a boat in wind and rain, said police Cpl. <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Glass </PERSON>. Four men were stranded at the mouth of the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, each on separate barges used in the offshore oil industry. They were trapped when the weather became too rough for the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> to rescue them. `` They just rode it out,'' Petty Officer <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> said this morning. A rescue center maintained hourly contact with the men. In <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernard </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Parish </LOCATION> just east of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, the storm hampered efforts to fight three major house fires, said civil defense official <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Bracamontes </PERSON>. `` It's rough,'' <PERSON> Bracamontes </PERSON> said. `` These firemen out there now have a rough time trying to pull those hoses in this wind.'' <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> was to return today after cutting short a trip to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> a day early. <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> Lt. Gov. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> Lt. Gov. <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Dye </PERSON>, whose boss <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Mabus </PERSON> traveled with <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>, declared emergencies in parts of their states and put their National Guards on alert. <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> declared a statewide emergency Friday. <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> Emergency Management Director <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said the declaration would allow officials to cope with the potential side effects of the hurricane, including the need for public shelters and the possibility of tornadoes and flash floods. Democratic presidential candidate <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> indefinitely postponed an outdoor rally Friday in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> as well as two indoor fund-raisers _ a $ 1,000-per-couple cocktail party and a $ 10,000-per-couple buffet. All along the coast, residents taped up windows and boarded up homes before fleeing to evacuation centers. `` It seems like you have to leave every time you turn around. We're evacuees,'' said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzales </PERSON>, 66, of <LOCATION> Delacroix </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. `` You know you're leaving home and you might not have a home to come back to.'' Others stocked up on water, canned goods and batteries to wait out the storm at home. `` Once you make up your mind to stay, all you can do is stay,'' said <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> <PERSON> Mallon </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Dauphin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, resident. As many as 10,000 Mississippians headed for higher ground at evacuation centers or homes of friends or relatives, including some tropical storm novices. `` It's all going to be quite an experience,'' said <PERSON> Charlotte </PERSON> <PERSON> Cirec </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Gulfport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, who moved from <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> two years ago. In <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, military planes were flown inland or moved into hangars. The USS Lexington, a training aircraft carrier based at <ORGANIZATION> Pensacola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION>, set out to the safety of open sea. <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION>, the sixth named storm of the 1988 <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> storm season, is the second hurricane. The first, <PERSON> Debby </PERSON>, reached minimal hurricane strength briefly before hitting Mexican coast last month. <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION> hit land on the 23rd anniversary of Hurricane Betsy, which spilled its storm surge over levees and flooded eastern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, killing 70 people in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and causing $ 1.1 billion in damage. In the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> early today, Tropical Storm <PERSON> Gilberto </PERSON> formed about 250 miles south-southeast of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, or at latitude 15.1 north, longitude 64.2 west. <PERSON> Gilberto </PERSON>, packing winds of 40 mph, was moving to the west at near 15 mph.

 Insurgents belonging to an outlawed tribal group in the eastern state of <LOCATION> Tripura </LOCATION> surrendered arms today after reaching a peace agreement with the government, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> reported. An unknown number of <ORGANIZATION> Tribal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Volunteers </ORGANIZATION>, the insurgent group, gave the weapons to army officers at a village near the <LOCATION> India-Bangladesh </LOCATION> border. The surrender follows a negotiated settlement Aug. 12 by the <LOCATION> Tripura </LOCATION> state governement and the federal government with the insurgents. The rebel group has been fighting for a separate state for the past decade and has been blamed for the killing of at least 600 non-tribal settlers in the region. The problem started in 1951 with the steady influx of settlers from <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> and other parts of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> into <LOCATION> Tripura </LOCATION>. The economic and social patterns in the state began shifting. Soon the tribals who had originally settled the area were outnumbered. In the 1970s, tribal unrest gave rise to the <ORGANIZATION> Tribal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Volunteers </ORGANIZATION>, which declared `` independent Tripura'' as its objective and took up arms. Under the August agreement, the insurgents agreed to give up arms in exchange for 20 seats in the new state legislature.

 Two former members of a militant Jewish group which was led by the now-Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> admitted they helped kill a Swedish <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> envoy to <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> 40 years ago, an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> journalist said today. It was the first time that members of the underground group, <ORGANIZATION> Lohamei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yisrael </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fighters </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, also widely known as the `` Stern Group,'' confessed to the 1948 killing of Count <PERSON> Folke </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernadotte </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Margalit </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s state-run <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Margalit </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> his information was based on interviews he conducted with <PERSON> Yehoshua </PERSON> <PERSON> Zetler </PERSON> and <PERSON> Meshulam </PERSON> <PERSON> Makover </PERSON>, two of <PERSON> Bernadotte </PERSON>'s killers. One of the interviews was shown Friday on Educational TV. The radical <ORGANIZATION> Lohamei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yisrael </ORGANIZATION> group, headed by <PERSON> Avraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>, was a splinter faction of the more mainstream group <ORGANIZATION> Irgun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zvai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leumi </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-. The faction advocated guerrilla rebellion against British rule in mandate <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>. In 1942, <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> was shot and killed by the British police, and <PERSON> Lohamei </PERSON> <PERSON> Herut </PERSON> <PERSON> Yisrael </PERSON> devised a three-man leadership of <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, <PERSON> Yisrael </PERSON> <PERSON> Scheib-Eldad </PERSON> and <PERSON> Natan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yellin-Mor </PERSON>, with <PERSON> Eldad </PERSON> serving as the group's ideologist. <PERSON> Margalit </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Zetler </PERSON> as saying he decided to kill <PERSON> Bernadotte </PERSON>, President of the Swedish <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> during and after the World War II, after the envoy raised far-reaching Palestine partition ideas. <PERSON> Bernadotte </PERSON> was appointed in May 1948 to negotiate a cease-fire and recommend a settlement in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 1948 War of Independence. `` <PERSON> Zetler </PERSON> said he conferred with <PERSON> Eldad </PERSON>, and the two traveled to <LOCATION> Haifa </LOCATION> to discuss it with Yellin-Mor. Yellin-Mor demanded that after the killing, the <ORGANIZATION> Lohamei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yisrael </ORGANIZATION> deny its role and blame the slaying on a tiny group of zealots called <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Homeland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Margalit </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Zetler </PERSON> returned to <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and selected three men to join him and Makover on the mission: the late <PERSON> Yehoshua </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> and another man, `` who is still alive but refuses to disclose his identity,'' <PERSON> Margalit </PERSON> said. `` They call him -LRB- the fifth man -RRB- the <LOCATION> Gingi </LOCATION>, or the red-haired one,'' <PERSON> Margalit </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Margalit </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Makover </PERSON> as saying the guerrillas arrived in two cars to the spot selected by <PERSON> Zetler </PERSON> for the Sept. 17, 1948, killing in downtown <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Zetler </PERSON> was driving a De <PERSON> Soto </PERSON> car and the four others were in a jeep, dressed in khaki shorts and peaked caps of the Jewish army. `` There was also an Australian journalist who told the group when <PERSON> Bernadotte </PERSON>'s convoy was due to pass,'' <PERSON> Margalit </PERSON> said without elaboration. He quoted <PERSON> Makover </PERSON> as saying that when <PERSON> Bernadotte </PERSON>'s three-car convoy approached the narrow street, the jeep blocked its way and three guerrillas jumped outside, with <PERSON> Makover </PERSON> staying behind the wheel. `` They were supposed to find <PERSON> Bernadotte </PERSON>'s vehicle. Each one looked inside a car, and in the last vehicle, <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> saw the envoy,'' <PERSON> Margalit </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Makover </PERSON> as saying. `` <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> thrust the muzzle of his machine-gun inside, fired and wounded a French U.N. officer.'' `` He then backed up two steps, took a careful aim, fired into the car and killed <PERSON> Bernadotte </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Makover </PERSON> told <PERSON> Margalit </PERSON> he ordered the two other guerrillas, `` Gingi'' and <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON>, to fire at the tires of the remaining cars. When it was done, `` they jumped into the jeep and escaped,'' <PERSON> Margalit </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Makover </PERSON> as saying. The killing was widely blamed on the <ORGANIZATION> Lohamei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yisrael </ORGANIZATION> group, and the Israeli government launched a nation-wide hunt for its members, arresting 400 people, among them Yellin-Mor. But the killers were never found.

<HEAD>City Proposes $3.5 Million Settlement For Motorist Beaten By

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A motorist who suffered severe brain damage when he was beaten and thrown down a flight of stairs by two <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> police officers will get $ 3.5 million from the city under a tentative settlement, officials said. The settlement would be the largest in a police case in the city's history, said Deputy Corporation Counsel <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Piers </PERSON>. Piers testified Friday before a <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> committee, which unanimously urged the full council to approve the settlement. The `` spectacularly severe injuries'' suffered by the victim, <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Acosta </PERSON>, 43, in the May 1981 incident prompted city lawyers to reach the settlement with <PERSON> Acosta </PERSON>'s lawyers, <PERSON> Piers </PERSON> told the committee. `` This is the most egregious case of police brutality I have ever heard of,'' said <PERSON> Alderman </PERSON> <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>, a former officer. `` Give these poor folks the money they are certainly entitled to. This is outrageous.'' The incident began when the two officers saw <PERSON> Acosta </PERSON>, a former hotel waiter, make an illegal turn in traffic, officials said. The officers, <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucotti </PERSON> and <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Chirello </PERSON>, followed the victim to his <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION> apartment building and beat him severely before throwing him down a 17-step flight of stairs, Piers told the committee. Among the witnesses to the attack were <PERSON> Acosta </PERSON>'s wife and two of his children. The officers, who were never disciplined and are still on duty, said <PERSON> Acosta </PERSON> fought with them and then fell down the staircase while handcuffed. <PERSON> Acosta </PERSON> suffered permanent brain damage and has been at <ORGANIZATION> Elgin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, a mental institution, for the past five years. Piers said <PERSON> Acosta </PERSON> has undergone drastic personality changes evidenced by a suicide attempt, physical and sexual assaults on strangers, and frequent violent outbursts at the hospital. The Police Department's Office of Professional Standards made no finding of excessive use of force by the officers and <ORGANIZATION> Cook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>'s Attorney <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> declined to prosecute, Piers said. `` OPS is like a big washing machine,'' <PERSON> Alderman </PERSON> <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Langford </PERSON> said. `` Everything goes in dirty and comes out clean. We had better take this settlement and run.''

 A janitor who convinced thousands he had won the nation's largest Lotto jackpot has been arrested and charged with two felony fraud counts, the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lottery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said.

Liberty County Sheriff <PERSON> Harrell </PERSON> <PERSON> Revell </PERSON> said he felt <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> might need security, even though he stressed then that the man's Lotto ticket had not been verified yet.

But the lottery announced Wednesday that <PERSON> Sheelah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, 63, a real estate broker from <LOCATION> Winter </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, had won the $ 55.1 million jackpot. The customized vans were returned. <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> was charged with knowingly presenting a counterfeit or altered state lottery ticket and falsely making, altering, forging, passing or counterfeiting a state lottery ticket with intent to defraud. Lottery officials did not answer their phones after issuing a news release saying they had arrested <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>. The release did not say what penalties <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> could face if convicted. There also was no answer at the office of State Attorney <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Meggs </PERSON>, whose office assisted lottery security police in the investigation.

 Up to 50 million people will pound the boulevards, main streets and mud tracks of the world Sunday in the second Sport Aid `` Race Against Time'' to raise funds for starving children, organizers say. Billed as the biggest participation event in history, the six-mile road runs will begin in searing heat or torch-lit darkness, at speed or at a casual pace, when starting pistols fire simultaneously in 128 countries at 11 a.m. EDT. From remote island outposts to the crowded streets of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, young and old will don `` I Changed the World'' T-shirts for an enlarged rerun of Sport Aid'86. Organizer <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cater </PERSON> called it `` a petition of blistered feet'' to help poor countries `` do something for their children.'' `` Our slogan is ` Change the World','' he said. `` We hope to inspire people to feel that they can make a very real difference to the world they live in.'' The race starts at dawn local time on Monday in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> island of <LOCATION> Tonga </LOCATION>, `` the land where time begins,'' and as the Sunday evening sun sets over the Pyramids in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, Cater said. All 58 residents in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> island of <LOCATION> Pitcairn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> have pledged to run, as have the majority of the 2,000 residents in <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> off <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. `` When you live on a small island you tend to become very isolated from the rest of the world,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON>, editor of the <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islander </LOCATION> newspaper. `` Now we feel part of it. It's the biggest thing that's happened on the island.'' Two children from each participating country will formally kick off the global event with a 1,000-yard run from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Fifth Avenue to the steps of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> headquarters. They will be accompanied by <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalifa </PERSON>, a Sudanese athlete who launched the May 25, 1986, race that raised more than $ 35 million for African famine victims. Official runs have been organized in only 15 major <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> cities, and <PERSON> Cater </PERSON> said `` the bigger nations of the world can be a little insular.'' `` We just wish we could reach out to all the people in the -LRB- <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> -RRB- </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' he said. The 1986 race, which attracted nearly 20 million runners in 89 countries, flopped in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> because it coincided with a nationwide `` Hands Across America'' campaign to raise funds for the poor. Sport Aid will be broadcast live in six languages to a potential audience of 1.5 billion people through satellite TV and radio link-ups to 23 cities. Coverage will include excerpts of carnivals and concerts from <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Janeiro </LOCATION>. Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> will relay a special message of support during his visit to <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>. Money raised from runners' sponsors, ticket sales to the races and from sideline events will go to charities in mainly underdeveloped nations. One-fifth of funds raised in each developed country will go to poor and disabled children in that country. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> Children's Fund estimates that nearly 15 million children die each year from hunger and easily preventable diseases. By Saturday, 26 million people had signed up to run, but <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> officials of <ORGANIZATION> Sport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aid </ORGANIZATION> said they expect as many as 50 million when the starting pistols are fired. Sport Aid said <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>'s President <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuanda </PERSON> will start the race in the capital city of <LOCATION> Lusaka </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION>'s President <PERSON> Vigdis </PERSON> <PERSON> Finbogadott </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mauritius </LOCATION>' First Lady, <PERSON> Lady </PERSON> <PERSON> Sugnautah </PERSON>, and Brazilian soccer star <PERSON> Pele </PERSON> will put on their running shoes and participate in their country's runs. Other locally organized fund-raising events include a cross-country ski event by British army marines in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> island of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, and runs by passengers aboard the luxury ocean liner <LOCATION> Canberra </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> and by oil workers aboard tankers in the Gulf of <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, where 2.3 million runners have signed up, doctors will hold special roadside clinics and donate their fees to help inoculation and other medical programs. <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> has organized a run alongside the flood-swollen <LOCATION> Nile </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION>, but <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, also devastated by floods, has postponed its race, Cater said. In <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, government ministers will join a relay race in <LOCATION> Kuala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lumpur </LOCATION>. Free-fall army parachutists will herald the start of the race in <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION> by descending into <LOCATION> Muscat </LOCATION>'s Sultan Qaboos Stadium. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>, a massive 11-tier Sport Aid cake weighing 440 pounds was officially cut in <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION> and an official Sport Aid torch was moved by helicopter from <LOCATION> Abu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dhabi </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION>. About 2,000 people were expected to run Sunday. Cater urged `` everybody on Sunday to do anything they can to help, whether it's just going out and giving money to a local children's charity. Let's do something for the kids of the world.''

 The struggle for democracy in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> is threatening the nation's food supply, causing shortages of gasoline and increasing prices of fruits and vegetables, diplomats said Saturday. Western diplomatic personnel interviewed here said shortages of food and other supplies were widespread in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s capital Even the exclusive <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> store at which diplomats shop has run out of rice, they said. Diplomats are among the only residents who can still tap the virtually exhausted fuel supply. Many Burmese have had to walk up to 15 miles to take part in anti-government demonstrations, they said. The demonstrations prompted the government Saturday to end 26 years of single-party rule and announce that general elections will be held under a multiparty system. Embassies and foreign organizations sent more than 230 dependents and non-essential staffers to <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> Friday on a special <ORGANIZATION> Thai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> flight, leaving about 400 others awaiting evacuation. Diplomats said the evacuees included Americans, Australians, Filipinos, Malaysians, Indonesians, British, Japanese, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Koreans </LOCATION>, Soviets and Thais. Despite widespread looting and increasing violence in the <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> capital, the diplomats insisted they were evacuated strictly as a precautionary measure and said they hope to return soon. `` The diplomatic store is supposed to have rice, but it has not had it for a week or so,'' said one diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Diplomatic personnel `` have the same shortages as everyone else. We get fresh food at the markets but in limited supplies. And it has become very expensive. `` We -LRB- diplomats -RRB- are in the happy position of having freezers, and everyone has been gobbling up the food in their freezers because they are afraid the electricity will go off.'' The food shortage has occurred mainly because strikes and a fuel shortage have made it very difficult to get commodities into the capital. But the diplomat said hoarding is also to blame. Indeed, other diplomats have said the military has been hoarding goods in an attempt to starve the people into submission. Another Western diplomat, also speaking anonymously, said a small bag of rice in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> was selling for 600 kyats -LRB- $ 100 -RRB-, `` and the average person makes less than 400 kyats -LRB- $ 67 -RRB- a month. Vegetables and fruit are still around, but the prices have gone up a lot.'' A lack of gasoline has kept most buses from operating, `` so a lot of people have to walk,'' the diplomat said. `` Thousands of people had to walk 15 miles or more to get into town -LRB- for a pro-democracy rally Friday -RRB-,'' she said. `` They passed our -LRB- diplomatic -RRB- compound for more than an hour. Then they had to walk home again. `` You see almost no cars except for -LRB- those owned by -RRB- diplomats,'' she added. The few buses running `` are packed. You see 25 people sitting on the top of them. A lot of people are not going to work because of the transportation problem.'' Both diplomats said the foreign community had no fear of the massive crowds that have rallied in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> almost daily for several weeks to press for an end to one-party rule and an interim government to lead the country to democracy. But the crowds have made it difficult to move about. `` There are a million out walking but they are gentle, good-natured,'' the first diplomat said. `` There are reports that youngsters have been attacked by military intelligence people, but they -LRB- soldiers -RRB- are not interested in foreigners. `` There have been such huge crowds that if you wanted to get from one side of the city to the other you had to wait for an hour and a half'' for the protesters to pass, the diplomat said. `` Then you go one block and they are snaking back again. `` During the day everything is OK. But at night there are a lot of robbers and looters out and it is not safe.''

 <LOCATION> SANTIAGO </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> _ On the 15th anniversary of the bloody coup that installed him `` only for as long as circumstances demand,'' President Gen. <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> is eagerly pursuing a new eight-year mandate. He remains firmly in control of the military. But an increasingly unified and confident opposition predicts his political demise before the anniversary rolls around again next year. Commander of the country's fiercely disciplined army, <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> led the Sept. 11, 1973, coup that toppled the elected government of a Marxist, <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Allende </PERSON>, during a period of widespread social and economic upheaval. That same day, the armed forces solemnly announced by radio that they were `` assuming power only for as long as circumstances demand it.'' The statement was interpreted by most Chileans that a return to the long tradition of <ORGANIZATION> democratic </ORGANIZATION> rule would be swift. Instead, a decade and a half later, <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> has launched a huge campaign to persuade his countrymen that circumstances demand he remain in power until 1997 and that they they must vote accordingly in an Oct. 5 presidential referendum. In a clear demonstration that his military power base remains strong, <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> recently won the quick and unanimous backing of his fellow armed forces commanders for his sole candidacy in the referendum. The 72-year-old general had been campaigning hard for the nomination and had behind him the fervent backing of the army, by far the most powerful military branch. If he wins the referendum, he will begin a new eight-year term next March 11. If he loses, he remains in power another year until an open election is called and will hand power over to the winner in March 1990. Whether he wins or loses, a <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will be elected in 1990 for the first time since it was disbanded at the time of the coup. But the legislature will be virtually powerless to amend a 1980 constitution, crafted by <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s administration, that gives the military autonomy and a strong supervisory role in national affairs. Most polls how <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> lacking sufficient voter support. In an evident bid to increase his popularity, he has been easing political restrictions and cultivating a new, conciliatory image that contrasts with his harshly authoritarian reputation. He decreed an end to states of emergency in effect since he took power and lifted a ban on the return of all leftists in exile. Many of them were expelled or fled during a wave of fierce repression that followed the coup. `` Let's bury in forgetfulness that which keeps us apart,'' <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> declared to critics in an `` open letter'' published by <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> newspapers last week. In speech after speech, he maintains that <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> needs his strong leadership to wrap up reforms that will produce a new democracy, with effective safeguards against international Marxism and a strong-free market economy. A saturation campaign of pro-government advertisements on television, radio and in the press contends that his defeat would mean a return to the political and social chaos of the Allende years. It protrays his leading critics as politically bankrupt, quarrelsome hacks intent on personal gain. But after years of deep division, 16 opposition parties ranging from center-right to far left have united in an unusually coherent effort to defeat <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> at the ballot box. The coalition, called the Command for the No Vote, has launched its own low-budget but well organized campaign. Its advertisements recall <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s promises not to remain in power forever and declare, `` No more lies.'' Opposition leaders who once spent most of their time arguing now appear together at anti-government rallies and forums, declaring confidently that <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s days are numbered. A Sept. 4 rally attracted more than 100,000 people in what organizers called the biggest anti-government demonstration since the coup. They also have agreed on a general political platform that promises greater emphasis on social benefits but no revolutionary economic or political changes. If <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> loses the referendum, they plan negotiations with the armed forces to speed up his departure, amend the constitution and hold quick elections for a four-year transition government. <PERSON> Genero </PERSON> <PERSON> Arrigiada </PERSON>, a centrist <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION> who is secretary-general of the coalition, said the opposition's new unity is the result of a long and painful maturing process. He said party leaders now realize that their own infighting allowed <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> to seize power and to retain it. `` Just as Sept. 11 -LRB- 1973 -RRB- was the culmination of a deep political division, this campaign is the expression of just the opposite,'' he said. `` It's the end of the war between the parties.'' Asked if he expected <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> to still be in power next Sept. 11, he replied: `` No. This is the last one.''

 The law and order minister described Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> on Saturday as a `` tragic and misled person'' who is challenging the government on the orders of revolutionaries. Also Saturday, a newspaper reported that prominent Afrikaner politicians and academics, including the brother of a <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> minister, will meet next month with Soviet policymakers and black nationalist guerrilla leaders. <PERSON> Adriaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON>, the law and order minister, said revolutionaries have decided that <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, leader of the Anglican church in southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, should `` create incidents'' to embarrass <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> during the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presidential campaign and the current visit to the region by Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>. <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON>, who oversees the national police force, was reacting to <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>'s recent defiance of an emergency regulation forbidding calls for an election boycott. Three times in the past week, <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> has urged blacks and whites to boycott next month's municipal elections, which many blacks view as an entrenchment of segregated, white-controlled political structures. Police are investigating <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>'s statements to determine whether he should be prosecuted. <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON>, in a speech reported by the state-run <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said `` naive church leaders'' are being misused by the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla movement and South African Communist Party. <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> said <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, out of personal ambition, is playing a key role in a campaign to `` bring the country to its knees.'' The Argus, a <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> daily, said 18 white <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africans </LOCATION> will travel to <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, in late October for a six-day conference. They will meet with officials of the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla movement and with a <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> delegation that will include at least two deputy directors of the African Institute of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>, it said. South African authorities have discouraged contacts with the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The organization is outlawed in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and wages a bombing and sabotage campaign to undermine the Afrikaner-dominated government. According to The Argus, the delegation heading to <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION> will include <PERSON> Willem </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, a former newspaper editor whose brother, <PERSON> Frederik </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, is minister of education and a possible candidate to succeed President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>. Others in the group reportedly will include <PERSON> Wynand </PERSON> <PERSON> Malan </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> member who heads the small, anti-apartheid <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Frederik </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Zyl </PERSON> <PERSON> Slabbert </PERSON>, former leader of the liberal <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Malan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Slabbert </PERSON> have met with <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> officials previously. Afrikaners, descended from Dutch and other northern European settlers, make up about 60 percent of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s 5 million whites. Many Afrikaners have broken with <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in recent years, some to the left because of disenchantment with apartheid, and a far larger number to the right to protest what they perceive as concessions to blacks. Under apartheid, the 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The white minority controls the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

 Except for choosing texts and shaping the curriculum, most teachers feel left out of critical decisions affecting classroom life, according to a nationwide poll released Saturday. Ten percent or fewer of 21,698 public school teachers surveyed by the <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> for the Advancment of Teaching felt they had any say in issues like teacher evaluation or selection of new teachers and administrators. Just 20 percent believed they were influential in tailoring school budgets. `` The report endorses what I have often said _ that teachers are treated like very tall children instead of professionals,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatwood </PERSON> <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest teacher union with 1.9 million members. On the positive side, 79 percent of those surveyed said they felt involved in choosing textbooks and instructional materials, and 63 percent said they had a say in shaping the curriculum. A report on the results, `` Teacher Involvement in Decisionmaking: A State-by-State Profile,'' revealed wide disparities in the degree of involvement teachers felt in different states. In <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, for example, 93 percent of teachers reported a high level of involvement in choosing textbooks, 85 percent said they helped shape the curriculum, and 50 percent said they were involved in setting student promotion policies. But only 63 percent of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> teachers said they helped choose texts, 40 percent said they were involved in shaping the curriculum, 36 percent had a say in tracking students into special classes, and just 1 percent felt they had influence in selecting new teachers. `` The evidence shows that in many matters that are important to building a good school, teachers have not been very much involved,'' foundation president <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyer </PERSON> said in an interview. <PERSON> Boyer </PERSON> said school reformers must find a middle ground, a way to involve teachers while maintaining a sensible monitoring and support role for state education officials. `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s school reform movement is at a crossroads,'' he said in a forward to the report. `` During the past five years, academic requirements have been tightened, standards have been raised, but most of the mandates for reform have been imposed top-down, and we're beginning to discover that outside regulation has its limits.''

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s ruling party decided today to end 26 years of single-party rule and to hold a general election under a multiparty system. The decision was a victory for opposition leaders and for hundreds of thousands of Burmese who have taken to the streets in sometimes violent demonstrations that have toppled two presidents in three months. Speaking before 968 delegates at a special party congress, the president admitted that major errors were commmitted by the party and said the interests of the people were paramount. `` Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely,'' he said in a speech carried by the state-owned Radio <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>. He pledged a free and fair general election will be held as soon as possible but gave no date. The broadcast announcer said the decision was unanimously adopted by the delegates of the <ORGANIZATION> Burma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> said a party emergency session of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday will make necessary amendments to the constitution to adopt the multiparty system and also to form an independent commission to supervise the elections. He urged government employes, who have left their jobs in sympathy with the pro-democracy movement, to return to their jobs so the government can function. The special party congress was originally scheduled for Monday to decide whether a referendum on one-party rule would be called. Radio <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> said the delegates today decided to scrap the referendum idea and to go ahead with elections under a multiparty system. Today's announcement came one day after former Prime Minister U Nu, toppled in a 1962 military coup, announced the formation of a rival government to take power from <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>. It was not immediately clear how today's development would affect U Nu's plan, which was not supported by all opposition figures. Also Friday, about 500 renegade soldiers joined protesters demanding formation of an interim government and full democracy. It was the first major defection of troops to the opposition. The moves followed weeks of massive, occasionally bloody turmoil in this isolated Southeast Asian nation that left dozens of people dead. Unofficial reports said the death toll could be in the hundreds from street riots that broke out in July. In a letter to embassies on Friday, 82-year-old U Nu called for general elections Oct. 9. He announced a Cabinet with himself as prime minister, former President <PERSON> Mahn </PERSON> <PERSON> Win </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> as president and retired Gen. Tin Oo, a vocal critic of the current authoritarian leadership, as defense minister. However, Tin Oo and two other members of the rival Cabinet _ retired military commanders <LOCATION> Aung </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shwe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Saw </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Myint </LOCATION> _ resigned today, and reliable sources said U Nu had not consulted them about his move. The Bar Council of <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> said students and other opposition groups also had not been consulted. The three men also said in a statement that they were resigning from a League for Democracy and Peace that U Nu had formed earlier to oppose the <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>'s government. <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON> <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON>, an opposition figure and daughter of slain independence leader <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON>, told reporters the announcement of a multiparty system was `` a positive step,'' but said it could take up to two years to form parties to contest in general elections. `` Under the present economic and political situation, an interim government will be the best solution. It -LRB- the interim government -RRB- would deal with economic problems and also hold general elections,'' she told reporters. Another opposition leader, retired Gen. <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON>, said he doubted `` the prevailing situation will permit holding of general elections under the present government.'' <PERSON> Toru </PERSON> <PERSON> Ohno </PERSON>, a Japanese <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> specialist at <ORGANIZATION> Osaka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said: `` The fact that the ruling party took action two days ahead of its original schedule ... means that <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>'s government can no longer control or suppress protest. I'm glad the party made the compromise in an effort to seek a peaceful and democratic settlement. Ne Win led the 1962 coup that toppled U Nu. Ne Win resigned as head of the ruling party in July, citing in part widespread street protests in March and June. Riots flared when the party chose <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> to succeed Ne Win. <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> is a hardliner widely hated for his brutal suppression of dissidents. The government said 112 people died in anti-government demonstrations, but diplomats estimated hundreds were killed. <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> resigned Aug. 12 after 17 days in power, and <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> was named to replace him. <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> was <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s first civilian leader in 26 years, but protests and nationwide strikes continued as opponents demanded an immediate end to one-party rule.

 Postmaster General <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> wants to bring <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s generations closer together, and if that brings the Post Office a little extra business he wo n't mind. `` Plant a Family Tree'' is the name of <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s plan, in which millions of family history forms will be given out, in hopes that youngsters will write to their grandparents seeking information to fill them out. `` Letters provide an important link between families. Grandparents often meet their grandchildren through an exchange of letters and photographs long before they see each other face-to-face,'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said. But it is n't just a business proposition, says <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>. He could generate more business by concentrating on big advertisers and catalog companies. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> is part of the fabric of American life. We do more than deliver the mail. We deliver ideas and dreams and help preserve our heritage,'' he says. As part of the family tree program the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> has printed millions of folders which discuss family histories on one side and contain a genealogical form on the back to fill in information on parents, grandparents and great-grandparents. The forms will be available, free, in post offices by the first week in October. To get things started, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> invited 27 third graders from <LOCATION> Dale </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, to his <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> office on Friday to hear about the project and mail letters to their grandparents _ letters likely to get special treatment, since they were handed directly to the postmaster general. `` It's just finding out about a generation you do n't have much contact with,'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said of his hopes for the program. It's children asking: `` Tell me about yourself, gramps Tell me about my parents when they were my age.'' `` What a compliment, to be asked about yourself by grandchildren,'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> added, in an interview. Many youngsters will probably telephone for information, of course. But, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> noted nostalgically, `` You do n't tie ribbons around old phone calls in the attic.'' In some countries, generations live together and get to know each other, but that's not often the way in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. As a result children tend not to know their grandparents very well, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> explained to the youngsters. `` We're running out of glue in this country. People are no longer as family oriented. People are no longer as community oriented ... This is a try to bring the family together,'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurst </PERSON> of the 30-million member <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retired </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Persons </ORGANIZATION> hailed the program as a way of increasing harmony among people from different generations. `` You can be sure our grandmothers and grandfathers will be as excited as can be to help all the grandchildren around the nation fill in the blanks in their family trees,'' <PERSON> Hurst </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> noted that only after becoming an adult do many people realize what they missed if they were not close to grandparents. And by that time it is often too late. In addition to providing a form for starting a family tree the folder includes tips on pursuing a more detailed family background, including suggested sources for genealogical information, such as the Census, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archives </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Genealogical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>.

 Opera star <PERSON> Placido </PERSON> <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON> wowed the fans watching celebrities arrive for the glittering opening of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s 66th formal opera season. `` I could have fainted dead away,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Snow </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, as <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON> walked by wearing a tuxedo jacket over blue jeans. `` He's so wonderful ... not stuck up at all.'' <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON> starred with <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Verrett </PERSON> in a 3 -LCB- - hour performance Friday night of <PERSON> Meyerbeer </PERSON>'s 19th century romance, `` L'Africaine. The <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chronicle </ORGANIZATION> applauded the stars' passionate performances, but questioned the `` improbable'' choice of the opera for the opener. It is the story of the love of a presumed African woman for <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> explorer <PERSON> Vasco </PERSON> <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Gama </PERSON>. At the end, she turns out to be an East Indian queen. But for those unwilling to pay the opening night ticket prices, ranging from standing room at $ 15 to $ 350 for a box seat, the show was outside. Some 100 people _ including one who brought along a 10-foot python for company _ lined the street outside the Opera House to watch the arrival of men in black tie and tails and jeweled women in $ 10,000 gowns. `` Is n't this an evening,'' marveled longtime first-nighter <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON>. Among those entering the <ORGANIZATION> Opera </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> were <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Getty </PERSON>, heiress <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Hearst </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> and designer <PERSON> Paloma </PERSON> <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON>. People who bought standing room tickets started lining up early in the day. <PERSON> Ingrid </PERSON> <PERSON> Sumeri </PERSON> and seven friends among the standees marched into the Opera Hall, across from City Hall, to party in the lobby before the show. `` This is our third opening,'' she said. `` We always bring a picnic and have dinner _ cold salmon, baklava, champagne, lots of good things.'' After they entered, the big-money crowd arrived after pre-opera parties that included a museum supper at $ 175 a head, and the <ORGANIZATION> Opera </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION>'s ball, in a large white tent, at $ 400 each. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> jeweler <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Silberstein </PERSON> was on hand for the guild's 5 p.m. bash. `` There is n't anything I could think of in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> that would be a reason to be in black tie in the afternoon,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Harare </LOCATION> today on the first leg of a pilgrimage to five black-ruled nations bordering racially-troubled <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Before leaving <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> on the 10-day journey, the pontiff said he hopes he can help solve some of white-led <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s problems on a future trip there. His fourth journey to <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and his 39th abroad will be to <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Swaziland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> _ all countries less than 20 years old that vehemently oppose <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> but depend on it for economic survival. In an unusual statement Friday, the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> emphasized the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> was not snubbing <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and hoped to visit the country in the future. It said the <PERSON> pope </PERSON>'s full schedule on this trip made a stop there impossible. The statement appeared directed at reports the pope had ruled out a visit to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, where a white minority rules 26 million blacks. During nearly 10 years at the helm of the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> has strongly denounced apartheid. `` No system of apartheid or separate development will ever be acceptable as a model for the relations between peoples or races,'' he said in a 1985 address in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>. In May, the pontiff received Anglican archbishop and 1984 Nobel Peace Prize winner <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, who defiantly invited arrest and prosecution Sunday by urging a boycott of Oct. 26 municipal elections in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>'s challenge to the government came two days after the South African law and order minister, <PERSON> Adriaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON>, said the time had come to `` clip the wings'' of church leaders who hide behind the `` mask of liberation theology.'' Earlier this week, police armed with a search warrant seized a tape of <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>'s sermon at the archbishop's <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> office. When the pope greeted <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> and other South African clergymen in May, he said the system of racial segregation has exacted a `` terrible toll.'' <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> urged tougher sanctions by Western nations _ an issue on which the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> has not taken a position. South African Roman Catholic bishops, who have worked closely with Anglicans, were waiting for the pope at his first stop in the <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> capital of <LOCATION> Harare </LOCATION>. They are attending a conference of regional bishops there. After a meeting with <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON>, the pope planned to address the 71 bishops in a Dominican convent. The speech, one of 42 drafted during a summer vacation in the mountains, was expected to set the tone for the 12,400-mile voyage. In a document issued two years ago, the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> said it was perfectly legitimate for the oppressed to take action _ such as passive resistance _ to secure structures and institutions in which their rights would be respected. But it warned clergy against direct involvement in politics and against any efforts to inject Marxism into church work on behalf of the poor.

<TEXT>
 The floods that inundate this poor, overpopulated nation with deadly regularity are a combination of man-made and natural phenomena. This year's deluge _ the most devastating in memory _ has claimed more than 600 lives by government count and more than 1,400 according to newspapers. It has submerged three-quarters of the country, spawning disease and destroying homes, roads, bridges, schools and food warehouses. From the air, <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> looks like a large brown sea with atolls where the map shows cities, towns and villages. Individual rivers can no longer be discerned. The deluge comes just one year after a flood covered half the country and claimed about 300 lives by government count and about 1,500 according to newspapers. <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, a country born in 1971, is seemingly condemned to repeated disasters. The 1970-71 war of independence from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> killed 3 million people, according to the government. Since then, floods, cyclones and tidal waves have claimed at least 20,000 lives. Even in the dry season, overcrowded river ferries sink regularly, with losses of life that often exceed 100. Bangladeshis meet this cycle of tragedy with acceptance that often bewilders outsiders and has its roots in the Islamic religion. Again and again, people lose their homes and their families, but not their faith. They repeat: `` It is the will of Allah -LRB- God -RRB-.'' Some of the causes of the disasters are internal, such as a birthrate that has made <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> one of the world's most densely populated nations. Others, such as the floods, originate beyond its borders and beyond its control. A series of historic shifts drew the borders that define <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>. When British-ruled <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> won its independence in 1947, the borders of the Asian subcontinent dissolved and became two new countries _ predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Hindu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> and overwhelmingly Moslem East and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. The division left low-lying <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, then known as <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, with little more than an overpopulated river delta barely above sea level. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, separated from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> by 1,000 miles of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, was virtually defenseless against flood waters that cascade from the mountains of neighboring <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>. `` Obviously, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> got the better deal,'' said <PERSON> Nazrul </PERSON> <PERSON> Islam </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Dhaka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s geography department. `` I think they had stronger negotiators, more money, more knowledgeable and educated people.'' <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> got the oil fields of the <LOCATION> Assam </LOCATION> region, as well as <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bengal </LOCATION> with its port of <LOCATION> Calcutta </LOCATION>, a hub of industry, education and government. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> got <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bengal </LOCATION> _ a region of poor farmers with rice paddies and jute fields. It also got the poor area of <LOCATION> Assam </LOCATION>, including a few tea plantations. Today, Indian <LOCATION> Assam </LOCATION> pumps 96,000 barrels of oil a day. <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> finally struck oil there in 1986, but it is only pumping about 600 barrels a day. `` If <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> had n't asked for the area with the Moslems, it would n't have gotten <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>,'' said an Indian diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity. `` <LOCATION> Calcutta </LOCATION> and the oil were in Hindu areas.'' The 1971 civil war, when the Bengali-speaking East Pakistanis rose against their Urdu-speaking rulers from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, created the independent nation of <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>. But the new nation, free of the West Pakistan-based government, was even further deprived of the economic strength to combat natural disasters. <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> has a per capita income of $ 150 a year, compared to $ 371 in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and $ 260 in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. The population density is already 2,000 people per square mile, the third highest in the world after the prosperous city-states of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>. In the past 41 years, <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>'s population has swelled from 40 million to 110 million. At the present birth rate, the population will double in about 35 years. After the war of independence, the nation's few resources _ and defenses against disasters _ were further eroded. Greedy contractors and poor farmers in search of fuel felled entire forests on the Himalayan slopes in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>. The deforestation eliminated vast tracts that had helped retain flood waters and held back the silt that clogs the rivers and aggravates flooding. Bangladeshis have virtually no place to live except on the plains of rivers that overflow every year, when rain-swollen currents rush through the width and breadth of <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> to the Bay of <LOCATION> Bengal </LOCATION>. The mightiest of the rivers _ the <LOCATION> Brahmaputra </LOCATION>, which starts in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and flows through <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Ganges </LOCATION>, which originates in <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION> and runs through <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, and the Meghna, which rises in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> _ are up to 12 miles wide under normal conditions and spawn hundreds of tributaries. A cry rose arose from Bangladeshis for regional cooperation to find an ecological solution to the onslaughts on a country former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> termed `` an international basket case.'' The call, repeated last week by <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>'s President <PERSON> Hussain </PERSON> <PERSON> Muhammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON>, has gone largely unheeded. `` Ten years ago there was a proposal for the Himalayan ecosystem,'' said <PERSON> Erling </PERSON> <PERSON> Dessau </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>. `` There was n't much interest in it.''

 Two West German doctors are believed to have been captured in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> by the communist government as they sought to help wounded guerrilla soldiers, a private aid official said Saturday. <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramdohr </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> German </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Doctors </ORGANIZATION>, said Moslem guerrillas reported a man and a woman from the group were apprehended by Afghan communist authorities in the southeastern provincial capital of <LOCATION> Ghazni </LOCATION>. `` We can not confirm it 100 percent.

He declined to identify the two but said they were about a week overdue returning from a trip to the central Afghan province of <LOCATION> Bamyan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramdohr </PERSON> said a guerrilla source reported that the pair was driving toward <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> with a wounded rebel and a translator when they lost their way and accidentally strayed into communist-controlled territory. The Germans and their wounded charge were apprehended, but the translator fled, according to the report. He said guerrillas believed the couple were flown to <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> Friday or Saturday. German embassy officials were unavailable for comment as the mission was closed for the weekend. Soviet troops have been helping the Afghan government fight the U.S.-backed guerrillas since December 1979. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> agreed in April to withdraw its estimated 115,000 troops by February 1989.

<HEAD>Dukakis Faced `The Troops' In Address To American Legion</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The 70th annual convention of the American Legion, as conservative a conclave as one was likely to find last week, was in high spirits for speeches by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. But some booed the mere mention of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. So, why did the Democratic presidential nominee bother to show? `` He'd be foolish not to face the troops,'' said retired Marine <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Steffanic </PERSON>, commander of the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Legion. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor could not afford to ignore the nation's largest veterans organization, `` even if he felt like he was n't going to sway the first vote,'' said <PERSON> Legionnaire </PERSON> <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON>. `` It would be detrimental to his campaign. The Legion is almost 3 million strong,'' said <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON>, 58, of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Augusta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION> Democrat <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> clearly was no favorite of this group when he ran against <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> four years ago, but he `` toughed it out'' at the Legion's 1984 convention, <PERSON> Steffanic </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> paused in his speech, which to that point had been received in stony silence, and jokingly advised his audience it was OK to applaud. That brought laughter `` but he was no match whatsoever for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Steffanic </PERSON>, 67, of <LOCATION> Portola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' pitch before the American Legion on Thursday included assurances that he favored a strong national defense, use of force against terrorists and a Cabinet-level post for veterans' affairs He also lashed out at the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration for closing hospitals, clinics and counseling centers and touted programs in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> for homeless or unemployed veterans. `` An awful lot of guys who heard that speech were swayed,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, 36, a lawyer, disabled <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> veteran and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> supporter from Quincy, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. `` He focused on the needs of veterans, and the other two guys -LRB- <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> -RRB- totally failed to do so.'' Another <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> delegate, <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Harwood </PERSON> of <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON>, disagreed. `` I know some of the veterans' affairs that go on in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, and what -LRB- <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> -RRB- says up here and what he does, does n't agree,'' <PERSON> Harwood </PERSON> said. `` As far as the defense of this country is concerned, I would have to agree with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. ... I'm not going to vote for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>.'' <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> veteran <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellerkamp </PERSON>, 65, said he was for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> before and after the convention. Even though <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` seemed nervous,'' including his blunder Wednesday about Sept. 7 being Pearl Harbor Day, and although veterans in general agree with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> that the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> is in decline, <PERSON> Ellerkamp </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said nothing to make him change his mind. `` I felt like both -LRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> -RRB- told us what we wanted to hear,'' said <PERSON> Ellerkamp </PERSON>, of <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>. Also, veterans do n't blame <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for cutting back VA services, <PERSON> Ellerkamp </PERSON> said `` They blame the system, not any individual,'' he said. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said most of those attending the convention were veterans of World War II and <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, older men who own homes, hold established jobs or have retired, and have little in common with Vietnam-era veterans. `` If you can afford to come to a national convention, you certainly are n't representative of the average veteran on the street,'' he said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' reception was far politer than might have been expected after Sen. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ariz </LOCATION>., a staunch advocate of veterans in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, was booed Wednesday for urging the Legionnaires to `` listen attentatively'' to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' message The heckling brought a stern rebuke from Legion National Cmdr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> `` </PERSON> <PERSON> Jake </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Comer </PERSON>, also of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. `` We will do our booing in the voting booth in November,'' <PERSON> Comer </PERSON> said.

 At stake in the voters' choice between <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in November is the delicate balance between liberal and conservative justices that has set the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s ideological course in recent years. When the next president takes office, the three oldest and most liberal justices on the nine-member high court will be over 80. The average age of the court's liberal wing will be a bit over 77. The average age of its conservative bloc will be 59. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> almost certainly would appoint far more conservative justices as president than <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would. Four years ago, there were predictions that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would have the chance to decide the future of an aging <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> for generations to come, but things did n't work out that way. There is no question that the court is younger and more conservative than it was at the start of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s second term. But liberal justices still exert critical influence, and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s opportunity to turn the court into a conservative stronghold has passed In this election year, however, predictions of sweeping changes in the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in the next four years seem more likely to come true. The nine justices enjoy lifetime tenure. None is reported to have grave health problems, and none has made any public mention of retirement plans. The court's leading liberals are Justices <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, 82, <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, 80, and <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON>, soon to be 80. Justice <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, 68, often joins them, particularly in criminal law decisions. The court's conservative bloc is led by Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON>, 63. Its most conservative member is <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON>, 52. In varying degrees, the conservatives are bolstered by Justices <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, 58, <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, 52, and <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, 71. Unlike <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> in 1984, the two presidential candidates this year have virtually ignored the high court and their vision of its future in their stump speeches. Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has noted that the next president `` will very possibly appoint two or three justices to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, where they'll sit well into the next century.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> promises to appoint judges `` who will interpret the Constitution, not legislate from the bench.'' He also says he will `` appoint judges who do n't reserve all their sympathy for criminals; who understand that victims have rights, too.'' The unspoken message appears to be that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, like <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, is determined to select conservative justices who could sway the high court's balance of power on such issues as abortion and affirmative action. The court for years has been drifting toward more conservative views regarding the rights of criminal suspects. As governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has appointed numerous judges who generally have been more liberal than conservative. However, they are screened by an 18-member, non-ideological `` merit commission.'' Speculation about the impact that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> or <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> might have on the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> depends on who they would nominate and which justices would be replaced. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> named <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> to the court in 1981. Since 1984, he has appointed <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. All three are more conservative then the men they replaced, but <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> did not have a chance to place a conservative in a seat formerly held by a liberal. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> succeeded <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> was a numerical replacement for retired Chief Justice <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Burger </PERSON> after <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> was elevated to chief justice, and <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> succeeded retired Justice <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> recently asked 40 court observers _ including campaign officials, former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aides, federal judges, law professors and lawyers _ to speculate on possible nominees of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. The 10 people named most often as potential <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> nominees, in alphabetical order, were: _ <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, 58, former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> chief of staff who is the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign chairman _ C <PERSON> Boyden </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, 45, the vice president's legal adviser since 1981. _ <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, 54, a Republican senator from <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> _ <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Higginbotham </PERSON>, 49, of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, a judge on the 5th U.S <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>. _ <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON> Miner, 54, of <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, a judge on the 2nd U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>. _ <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 65, secretary of Housing and Urban Development _ <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rymer </PERSON>, 47, a federal trial judge in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> since 1983 _ <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, 58, the former <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> governor who last month succeeded <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> as attorney general _ <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Winter </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 53, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, a judge on the 2nd U.S <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>. _ <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, 60, a law professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> and a national authority on civil procedure and federal jurisdiction The 10 people named most often as potential <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> nominees, in alphabetical order, were: _ <PERSON> Derek </PERSON> <PERSON> Bok </PERSON>, 58, president of <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and a former <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> dean there _ <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Breyer </PERSON>, 50, of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, a judge on the 1st U.S <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>. _ <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, 56, governor of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> _ <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, 47, a judge on the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> _ <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Bader </PERSON> <PERSON> Ginsburg </PERSON>, 55, a judge on the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> _ <PERSON> Amalya </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kearse </PERSON>, 51, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, a judge on the 2nd U.S <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>. _ <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Liacos </PERSON>, 59, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judicial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> _ <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>, 56, of <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, a judge on the 2nd U.S <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>. _ <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarbanes </PERSON>, 55, a Democratic senator from <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> _ <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tribe </PERSON>, 46, a <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> professor and a leading constitutional scholar

 Everyone showed up but the guest of honor, as friends and former colleagues of an aircraft engineer who went to lunch one day and never came back held their annual party on his behalf. Members of the crowd that gathered at <ORGANIZATION> Tequila </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Willie </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Saloon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Grill in trendy <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> on Friday said the disappearance seven years ago of <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Greer </PERSON> symbolized rebellion against the corporate world. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Connett </PERSON>, <PERSON> Greer </PERSON>'s old boss at the <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said others, himself included, have sometimes thought of disappearing when the pressures of family and job began to get to them. But <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> really did it. `` Hughes is full of very straight-laced people,'' said <PERSON> Sherry </PERSON> <PERSON> McCulloh </PERSON>, <PERSON> Greer </PERSON>'s former secretary. `` He is the anomaly. There is a little bizarreness in all of us.'' Meanwhile, party-goers wore `` Ed'' masks, and, borrowing the `` Where was <PERSON> George </PERSON>?'' catch phrase from this year's Democratic National Convention, asked, `` Where is <PERSON> Ed </PERSON>?'' <PERSON> Greer </PERSON>, an electronics engineer still in his early 30s and already on the fast track at <LOCATION> Hughes </LOCATION>, cleaned out his files on Sept. 9, 1981, and disappeared a day later, leaving behind a wife of 12 years and two young sons. <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> officials found his car one day later, with his wallet and clothing inside, near the beach in <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION>. But the theory that he drowned quickly evaporated when another <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> employee reported spotting <PERSON> Greer </PERSON>, dressed in jeans, at <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> around midnight the day he disappeared. `` You have n't seen me,'' the 6-foot-2, bearded <PERSON> Greer </PERSON> told the man, and a cult figure was born. When an investigation determined that his flight was not an act of espionage _ <PERSON> Greer </PERSON> had access to classified information _ <PERSON> Greer </PERSON>'s colleagues let their imaginations run free Employees started keeping pictures of <PERSON> Greer </PERSON> around the office, sometimes pasting cutouts of his smiling face on other pictures to show him on the beach or embraced with a bathing beauty. And every year since the disappearance, <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> employees celebrate the anniversary of his flight. The parties attract people who did n't even know <PERSON> Greer </PERSON>. `` You can think of all kinds of bad things that might have happened to him,'' Ms. <PERSON> McCulloh </PERSON> said. `` I like to think it was good things.'' She said she likes to think he wound up in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> or the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>, where he is leading the good life. But not everyone is amused. `` I'm kind of irritated about this party business,'' said <PERSON> Greer </PERSON>'s former wife, Kit, who divorced him after he disappeared. `` I know engineers ... It is mildy amusing to them.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> on Saturday wrapped up his visit to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, leaving the Chinese happy about a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision that could permit Chinese rockets to launch <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> satellites. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> also said he was satisfied that the Chinese would exercise prudence in their arms sales to the Middle East and other areas of the world. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said he conveyed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision about satellites to National Defense Minister <PERSON> Qin </PERSON> <PERSON> Jiwei </PERSON>. `` He was most pleased with that,'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> told reporters at the <ORGANIZATION> Wusong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Facility </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration on Friday announced it would give export licenses for satellites manufactured by <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> that are scheduled to be launched for Australian and <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> companies with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s Long March rocket. The decision must be approved by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and a group of Western allies that monitor high-technology transfers. Hong Kong-based AsiaSat is to put a satellite in orbit next year, while <ORGANIZATION> AusSat </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> will launch two satellites in 1991 and 1992 using the Chinese service. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said he had recommended to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that the licenses be approved. The settling of the satellite issue was the second major area of friction solved during <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>'s first trip to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, on Thursday, he told a news conference that he was `` fully satisfied'' with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s statement that it would exercise prudence in its arms sales to the Middle East and other areas of the world. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials did not elaborate. He said his talks were `` the best discussions we've had'' on the subject. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was concerned that Chinese sales of medium-range missiles to <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and proposed sales to other <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> countries would upset the regional military balance. <PERSON> Qin </PERSON> <PERSON> Jiwei </PERSON> told reporters that <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> arms sales were small compared to those of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and were carried out responsibly. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> was led by navy Cmdr. <PERSON> Zhang </PERSON> <PERSON> Lianzhong </PERSON> on a 50-minute tour of the Wusong base. He called the visit `` a sign of efforts to have exchanges with the entire range of the Chinese military.'' The defense secretary left after the tour for a flight to <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Asian Officials Regret Passage Of U.S. Textile Bill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Japanese official said Saturday he hopes President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will veto a bill approved by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to curb textile imports to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` It is regrettable that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved the bill, ignoring the fact that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> textile exports have increased and the industry did not perform as badly as many people believed,'' said <PERSON> Chang </PERSON> <PERSON> Chang-han </PERSON>, acting secretary general of the <ORGANIZATION> Taiwan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Textile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, by a 57-32 vote, Friday approved new curbs on textile, clothing and shoe imports. The bill still needs approval by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> before it can be sent to President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. The bill would freeze this year's imports of textiles, apparel and non-rubber footwear at 1987 levels and limit their growth to 1 percent annually thereafter. `` We hope President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will veto the bill if it is passed by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Chang </PERSON> said. `` Such a protectionist measure will only hurt American consumers who would have to pay higher prices for textile products.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s largest market for textile goods. Last year, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s apparel and textile exports to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> totaled $ 3.2 billion, up 14 percent from 1986. During a meeting in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> Saturday with visiting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Commerce Secretary <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Verity </PERSON>, the Japanese minister of international trade and industry, <PERSON> Hajime </PERSON> <PERSON> Tamura </PERSON>, expressed hope that the bill would be vetoed by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` because of its protectionist nature,'' a ministry official said. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the Japanese government had issued no formal reaction to the bill, however. In <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, a leading trade official said the bill was unnecessary and unlikely to survive a presidential veto. `` The bill is totally unnecessary and inappropriate ... because the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> textile industry has been doing well,'' said <PERSON> Miranda </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiu </PERSON>, acting assistant director of trade for the export-fueled British colony. `` Any protectionist measure would definitely have adverse effects on exporting countries -LRB- such as -RRB- <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Chiu </PERSON> said. She said it would be difficult to gauge the precise impact on the colony because the bill does not provide details on how it would be implemented. Exports from <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> of apparel and clothing accessories to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> reached $ 3.4 billion in 1986, up 9 percent from the previous year, according to the Census and <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Exports of textile fabrics to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> totaled $ 116 million in 1986, up 11 percent from 1985, it said.

 Major environmental groups, some of them no friends of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, have jumped to the defense of federal forest firefighting policies attacked by some western members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Sen. <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallop </PERSON>, R-Wyo., last week suggested that <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Penn </PERSON> <PERSON> Mott </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, be fired for following a `` let it burn'' policy in Yellowstone National Park Environmental spokesmen accused Wallop of grandstanding and called his suggestion ridiculous. Members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> who lead the committees overseeing the parks, also heavily critical of the administraion at times, defended the firefighting policy. `` I applaud the president and the secretary -LRB- of the interior -RRB- for standing firm'' against <ORGANIZATION> Wallop </ORGANIZATION>'s suggestion, said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Pritchard </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and a critic who has rarely applauded them for anything. `` Those who jump up in the midst of a major catastrophe and cry bloody murder and ` Off with their heads' remind me of <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> in Wonderland,'' <PERSON> Pritchard </PERSON> said. Interior Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON>, one of the three-member inspection team sent by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> over the weekend, has called the firefighting policy a `` disaster.'' The `` disaster'' remark was clearly intended as `` hindsight,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> stands by an earlier statement that what the park service and other agencies `` need now is our understanding of the difficulties they face and our support.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> since 1972 has followed a so-called `` let it burn'' policy which fights forest fires caused by humans and natural fires that threaten human lives and property, but lets most natural fires burn for the benefits they bring to forest regeneration. A century of fuel buildup from suppressing fires _ <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> was declared a park in 1872 _ are worsening fires today, some suggested. `` There's been a lot of inaccurate information passed around,'' said <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. Because of the drought, `` These fires are going to get away from you no matter what the policy is.'' Sen. <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Bumpers </PERSON>, D-Ark., chairman of the national parks subcommittee of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, toured <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> in August `` I do n't mind telling you I was glad to get out of there'' because of the fire danger and the fuel buildup, said <PERSON> Bumpers </PERSON> on Friday. `` There were as many trees on the ground as there were standing.'' `` The fire management policies of the <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> are sound, flexible and scientifically based. We support them,'' said a statement by <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Frampton </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Wilderness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. Referring to <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON>'s `` disaster'' remark, <ORGANIZATION> Wilderness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Beach </PERSON> said, `` I thinking he's hanging <PERSON> Mott </PERSON> out to dry. ... <PERSON> Mott </PERSON> has been one of the bright spots in an awful record.'' `` We think the calls for <PERSON> Mott </PERSON> to resign are ridiculous,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> SanGeorge </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Audubon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` Though we do n't favor letting people's houses burn down, we're concerned that -LRB- calling for <PERSON> Mott </PERSON>'s dismissal -RRB- would be the popular thing to do to respond to people who are concerned about their property,'' <PERSON> SanGeorge </PERSON> said `` Politics should not intrude on biology.'' <PERSON> Bumpers </PERSON> has promised a hearing on the fires at the request of Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Melcher </PERSON>, D-Mont. _ after the fires are out. <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> Superintendent `` <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbee </PERSON> ought n't be made a scapegoat, and <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Mott </PERSON> ought n't be made a scapegoat,'' <PERSON> Bumpers </PERSON> said. `` Are you going to fire -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> chief -RRB- <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>? The <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> fought every fire. There are fires burning out of control in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> right now -LRB- on <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> land -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Bumpers </PERSON> said. `` There are some places where Mother Nature takes control and man just ca n't do anything.'' `` I'm not interested in hearing from <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Mott </PERSON> or <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON>, but guys who know something about fire and horticulturists,'' <PERSON> Bumpers </PERSON> said. `` We're going to have a serious review. I'm not going to permit it to degenerate into vindictiveness, and I do n't think Sen. Wallop or Sen. <PERSON> Melcher </PERSON>, who both serve on my subcommittee, want that.'' Rep. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Vento </PERSON>, D-Minn., chairman of the counterpart <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee, said the policies `` are appropriate Plans for fighting fires in <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> have been on paper for a very long time. ... We'll review the policies. We'll learn things.'' <PERSON> Vento </PERSON> said he believed Wallop `` is trying to find a scapegoat and I do n't think that's appropriate.'' <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hair </PERSON>, executive vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>, with 5 million members the nation's largest conservation group, said, `` I do n't think this is the time for political grandstanding and I think that is precisely what Sen. Wallop is doing.'' <PERSON> Derrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Crandall </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recreation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION>, a trade association containing tourist and recreation businesses, said he had spoken with Wallop a few weeks ago and `` he feels the Park Service was n't listening'' to his concerns and those of his constituents. `` I understand the frustration of Sen. Wallop,'' <PERSON> Crandall </PERSON> said. `` There are very good arguments for the let-it-burn policy, and I think most people in the recreation-tourism community understand that.'' But, he said, `` I do n't have all the facts and I'm not going to suggest we know at this point what Director <PERSON> Mott </PERSON> should or should not have done.''

 The government today ordered a <LOCATION> Vietnamese </LOCATION> diplomat who confronted demonstrators with a gun outside his embassy to leave <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. An announcement by the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said Vietnamese Third Secretary <PERSON> Khang </PERSON> <PERSON> Than </PERSON> <PERSON> Nhan </PERSON> must leave the country by Sunday. Vietnamese Ambassador <PERSON> Tran </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Hung </PERSON>, pressed by the British government about <PERSON> Khang </PERSON>'s actions Sept. 4., turned over a toy gun on Thursday But today he gave a real gun to junior <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> minister <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Eggar </PERSON> and said it was the one <PERSON> Khang </PERSON> was holding when he confronted Vietnamese refugees protesting in front of the embassy, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said. A government statement said <PERSON> Tran </PERSON> told <PERSON> Eggar </PERSON> he could not waive <PERSON> Khang </PERSON>'s diplomatic immunity to enable <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> to prosecute the third secretary. On Thursday, the ambassador had agreed that <PERSON> Khang </PERSON> would forgo his immunity. On Sept. 4, the demonstrators that <PERSON> Khang </PERSON> confronted took photographs of him holding a gun. The pictures were published in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said earlier this week that it took a very serious view of the incident and warned the ambassador of the `` gravest consequences'' unless the diplomat's immunity was waived. Diplomatic missions in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> are not supposed to house arms. The government has taken violations of that rule seriously since a gunman firing from the Libyan Embassy killed a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> policewoman during a protest demonstration in April 1984. After a police siege of the embassy, the building was closed and diplomatic relations severed.

<HEAD>Adopted Child With AIDS Admitted to US After Bureaucratic Battle</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Sgt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Maggard </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>, have won a long, bureaucratic battle to get their adopted son with AIDS into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Now they face a sterner test: keeping him alive. <PERSON> Jared </PERSON> <PERSON> Maggard </PERSON> `` has three weeks, three months, three years; we do n't know,'' says his mother. His father says: `` Without a cure, we know <PERSON> Jared </PERSON> will die. Our goal is to give him as much time as possible.'' The miracle the Maggards hope for is a cure for acquired immune deficiency syndrome, which <PERSON> Jared </PERSON> had when he was born to a young Panamanian woman and an unknown father. The AIDS virus attacks the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to a wide variety of infections and cancers. It is most often transmitted through sexual contact, transfusions of tainted blood and the sharing of contaminated needles by drug abusers. AIDS can also be passed from mother to child at or before birth. When the Maggards found <PERSON> Jared </PERSON>, abandoned in a hospital in Colon, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, they did n't know he had AIDS. He was 11 months old, weighed 3 -LCB- pounds and was being treated for malnutrition. Pictures show skeletal arms and legs, ribs visible beneath thin, stretched skin, eyes sunken in an almost fleshless skull. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>, 25, had recently suffered a miscarriage, and she and her husband, a 26-year-old Army policeman then stationed at <PERSON> Fort </PERSON> <PERSON> Gulick </PERSON> on the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> end of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>, fell in love with the child. The couple, from <LOCATION> Ypsilanti </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, consulted <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> attorneys, hired a Panamanian lawyer and began adoption proceedings. They were quickly granted custody. The adoption became final last Wednesday. When the Maggards took <PERSON> Jared </PERSON> home from the hospital in December 1986, he also was suffering from an ear infection. His new mother pumped food into him _ sugar water, infant formula laced with cereal, canned baby food by the carton. <PERSON> Jared </PERSON> gained weight, but despite repeated visits to <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> clinics, the ear infection persisted. Finally, 11 months later, doctors, puzzled by their inability to cure the infection with standard antibiotics, ran a series of tests. They showed <PERSON> Jared </PERSON> had AIDS. `` There's no doubt he had it from birth,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Maggard </PERSON> said in a recent interview. `` And children born with AIDS do n't usually live beyond the age of 2. The prognosis is between 2 and 6 years at the most, and there have been only a few cases in which an infected child has reached the age of 6.'' The AIDS-positive test results came back on Sept. 15, 1987, a month before Sgt. <PERSON> Maggard </PERSON> was to begin a new assignment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Immigration and <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> officials, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consul general in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and army lawyers told the couple they could not take <PERSON> Jared </PERSON> home with them. `` We were told it was against the law for anyone with AIDS to enter the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and, besides, the adoption was not complete at the time,'' says Mrs. <PERSON> Maggard </PERSON>. `` We were told we should give <PERSON> Jared </PERSON> back and forget about it. I was n't about to do that.'' Sgt. <PERSON> Maggard </PERSON> extended his tour of duty in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> for another year rather than leave without his son. But repeated entreaties by the young couple failed to sway a government and military bureaucracy. On July 4, <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> weatherman, came to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to preside over an Independence Day celebration for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> servicemen and women and their families. By chance, he met Mrs. <PERSON> Maggard </PERSON>, who told him of the couple's plight. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> aired the story briefly on its nightly news program in early August. `` The next day, the telephone began ringing off the hook,'' says Mrs. <PERSON> Maggard </PERSON>. From those calls, the Maggards say, they learned for the first time of a provision in immigration rules that allow some AIDS victims into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on a parole basis. `` We had never heard of that before,'' says Mrs. <PERSON> Maggard </PERSON>. `` Nobody down here had ever told us of that. But the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> was clearly embarrassed, and it suddenly got behind us 100 percent.'' Sgt. <PERSON> Maggard </PERSON> says his commanding officer has told him that he can transfer to any one of four military posts in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> where the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> has AIDS treatment centers. He says he will choose within the next week or so whether to go to the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, area, to be near the <ORGANIZATION> Walter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, or to <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sam </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tex. </LOCATION>, where the Army hospital has a ward devoted to AIDS patients. `` In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jared </PERSON> can be treated with AZT, and that's not available to <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> doctors overseas,'' says Mrs. <PERSON> Maggard </PERSON>. AZT is a new drug recently approved for AIDS treatment by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. It is not a cure, but has been found to prolong the life of some victims by strengthening their immune systems. As the Maggards spoke, <PERSON> Jared </PERSON>, now a chubby, outwardly healthy appearing youngster of almost 3 years, played underfoot, jabbering in childish English and his native Spanish, part of a culture his parents say they are bent on preserving for him. `` Everybody remarks about how healthy he looks,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Maggard </PERSON>. `` But he has a lung infection that wo n't clear up, and doctors say there are seven stages in the progression of AIDS. Given the diseases <PERSON> Jared </PERSON> already has had, they figure he is in the fifth or sixth stage.''

<HEAD>Salinas Confirmed As Mexico's Next President</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 After a long and bitter debate, the <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION> today certified <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> as president of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. A spokesman for the chamber said the vote was 263-85. Opposition lawmakers, who claim <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> won the July 6 election through massive vote fraud, tried to stall the certification process by making numerous speeches during an all-night session. But they had no chance of prevailing. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> will begin a six-year term Dec. 1 and replace <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>. The raucous debate occurred because the election placed the largest number of opposition lawmakers in the legislature since the governing <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION>, was founded nearly 60 years ago. As expected, today's vote was along party lines. <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION>, won a majority of 260 in the 500-person chamber in the election, and at least three opposition deputies have since defected to the governing party. <PERSON> Orlando </PERSON> <PERSON> Arvizu </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> deputy from <LOCATION> Hidalgo </LOCATION> state, said Friday evening the chamber debate would continue `` until we certify the presidential election.'' `` If it's up to us, it -LRB- the confirmation -RRB- could last three days. We plan to destroy their arguments one by one,'' said a Popular Socialist spokesman. The <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> belongs to the left-of-center <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> coalition </ORGANIZATION> headed by former presidential candidate <PERSON> Cuauhtemoc </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON>. On Friday, opposition delegates walked out on a key legislative committee but failed to prevent the panel from recommending <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>' confirmation. The <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> members on the committee declared the July 6 election valid and said <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> won with 50.74 percent. The panel said <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> won 31.06 percent, and <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Clouthier </PERSON> of the rightist <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> won 16.81 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> accused the opposition of trying to derail an orderly presidential transition. `` What they are seeking is to destabilize the government and degrade the republic, its institutions and its politics,'' it said.

<HEAD>High Percentage Of Teachers Profess Belief In Supernatural</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A high percentage of high school biology teachers profess superstitious beliefs and about one in four think some races of people are inherently more intelligent than others, according to a survey. Also, about 19 percent of the teachers believe dinosaurs and humans lived at the same time, according to the national survey by two <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION> researchers that will be released this week, The <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> reported in its Saturday editions. Dr. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Eve </PERSON>, associate professor of sociology at <ORGANIZATION> UTA </ORGANIZATION>, and Dr. <PERSON> Dana </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON>, assistant professor of sociology, mailed questionnaires to biology teachers to try to determine why many college students held pseudoscientific beliefs, a finding of a 1987 survey. The two researchers sent a 12-page, 88-item questionnaire to about 400 teachers selected at random from a list of 20,000 provided by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. They received 200 responses; the survey had a 5 percentage point margin of error. Eve said he hoped the results would spur further research. The results, when compared with an international study of high-school students' biology knowledge, show `` we're doing something very, very, very wrong in biology education,'' Ms. <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> said. A study this year by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement found <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> students scoring no higher than eighth among 13 countries in the sciences and last in biology. The <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> researchers found what Eve called `` racial bigotry'' in responses to the survey statement: `` Some races of people are more intelligent than others.'' Twenty-six percent of the respondents said the statement was `` definitely true'' or `` probably true,'' while 24 percent circled `` inconclusive evidence.'' Based on the survey responses, Eve said, `` there's a sort of racism'' that major cultural accomplishments, such as the Egyptian pyramids or Incan religious structures `` could n't have been built by stupid Indians; it had to be white Europeans or space gods.'' Eve said 94 percent of those surveyed were white and 63 percent were male. Central to the study _ and most surprising to the researchers _ was that biology teachers seemed to misunderstand `` what science is all about,'' Eve said. Given the statement, `` Scientists seek facts, but sometimes the best they can do is theories,'' only 5 percent correctly answered `` definitely false.'' A theory is not an `` educated guess,'' as many lay people believe, he said. Science is a systematic method of arriving at conclusions, or theories, using the facts as a basis, he said. Eve and Ms. <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> cited poor teacher training as a major reason for the pseudoscientific and superstitious beliefs. In <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, for example, teachers are allowed to instruct one class a day outside their areas of certification. Only about 25 percent of teachers surveyed have degrees in biology. And too often, the study found, the science class was the teacher's secondary area of instruction, or the teacher had only science education as a major. Respondents to the survey were given statements and asked to agree or disagree. Some of their responses included: _ Dinosaurs and humans lived at the same time; 33 percent of the respondents agreed or were n't sure _ It is impossible for the living to communicate with the dead; 27 percent disagreed _ Some people can predict future events by actual psychic power, not just by intuition; 28 percent agreed _ One can not read other people's thoughts by psychic powers; 34 percent disagreed About 30 percent of high school biology teachers indicated they believe in biblical creationism, the belief that the universe and all its living things were created by a supreme being from nothing in seven days about 10,000 years ago, rather than evolution. `` There can be no question that we are in a disastrous situation,'' Eve said. `` Evolution is central to the understanding of biology.''

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s Olympic team canceled reservations on a jetliner two days before it crashed while approaching <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> airport, killing 75 people, officials were quoted as saying Saturday. <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> officials said they expected Soviet experts to join a team of Vietnamese and Thai experts to investigate the Air Vietnam accident. The Soviet-made Tu-134 jetliner with 81 people aboard was flying from the Vietnamese capital of <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> Friday when it slammed into a rice field and exploded four miles north of <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> airport during a thunderstorm. The six survivors, including the pilot, remained in intensive care Saturday at <ORGANIZATION> Bhumibol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Pham </PERSON> <PERSON> Vu </PERSON> <PERSON> Hien </PERSON>, a senior official of <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vietnam </ORGANIZATION>, said the plane apparently was hit by lightning, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> news service reported. A Vietnamese pilot who was among the six survivors earlier gave the same cause for the accident. <PERSON> Hien </PERSON> said the airline will pay compensation to the relatives of each victim, <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> said. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Nihon </ORGANIZATION> television network quoted Vietnamese officials as saying <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s 16-member Olympic team canceled reservations on the flight two days before the crash. Among the dead were <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s public health minister, <PERSON> Dang </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoi </PERSON> <PERSON> Huan </PERSON>, and its ambassador-designate to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Dhuong </PERSON> Vu. Also killed were <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s ambassador to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arun </PERSON> <PERSON> Patwardhan </PERSON>, and seven other officials of his embassy. No Americans were aboard the plane. Workers retrieved all 75 bodies from the wreckage on Friday. Thai newspapers said Saturday that workers of two charity groups argued heatedly over who would be first to retrieve the bodies. Workers of the Poh Tech <PERSON> Tung </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ruamkratanyoo </PERSON> foundations have previously have fought bloody battles at accident sites. The Poh Tech <PERSON> Tung </PERSON> volunteers claimed they spotted a body first, the Nation newspaper reported. But their rivals argued that they were the first to grab the victim's feet, it said. `` The argument would have erupted into a fist fight had the police not intervened,'' the newspaper said. State-run <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanoi </ORGANIZATION> reported Saturday that <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s Prime Minister Do Muoi ordered an investigation into the crash. The plane broke into three when it hit the ground. The pieces were scattered on a dirt road, a rice field and a pond, where the charred cockpit and fuselage were found along with most of the bodies. Two flight data recorders were recovered from the crash site. The Tu-134, the Vietnamese flag carrier's main aircraft, also is used by the Soviet airline <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION>. Several Tu-134s have crashed in recent years, including one in <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> in February that killed an undisclosed number of people, and one in October 1986 that killed President <PERSON> Samora </PERSON> <PERSON> Machel </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>. The Japanese aviation magazine <PERSON> Kokujoho </PERSON> said the plane, which was introduced in 1963, is no longer manufactured. Air Vietnam officials said they lack funding to buy newer, Western-made planes. The last major plane crash in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> was Aug. 31, 1987, when a <ORGANIZATION> Thai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> domestic airliner fell into the sea off the southern resort island of <LOCATION> Phuket </LOCATION>, killing all 83 people aboard the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> described the educational record of his administration as a triumph of `` common sense answers'' Saturday, but <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democratic leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> denounced the administration's educational policies as `` terribly wrong.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, taking note of the beginning of the academic year this week in many schools, said from the Oval Office in his weekly radio address that the prospects for education are `` brighter than they have been for over two decades.'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, responding for the Democrats, charged that `` nothing has been done by the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to link <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s economic future to rebuilding our nation's educational system. Nothing at all.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, as he has in many of his recent radio addresses, put in a plug for Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the Republican presidential nominee. `` The recovery of our schools has been a genuine grassroots accomplishment, and it proves the solution to problems is not to throw money at them but to come up with common sense answers and start applying them,'' the president said. `` I am proud that during our administration <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and I have been there with a sympathetic ear and a helping hand.'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, however, said, `` If the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> had its way, <PERSON> Pell </PERSON> grants -LRB- for needy college and university students -RRB- would be cut by 40 percent, college work study programs would end, vocational education would stop altogether, and aid to graduate school students would come to a halt. Even the ` drug free' school program would be cut by 50 percent.'' `` My friends, this is terribly wrong,'' the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> senator said. `` The administration subtracts from education,'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> adds to save it.'' `` I do n't understand why the administration has n't done its homework,'' he said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> conceded that there are shortcomings in the schools. `` We have just begun,'' he said. `` Far too many students are graduating from schools without the skills they need to prosper and the knowledge they need to grow.'' `` The education our children need is the ability to read, write and reason as well as any student in any country in the world,'' the president said. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said, `` The White House talks a lot about the three R's. But when it comes to helping education, their three R's amount to rhetoric, reductions, and retrenchment.'' The president also said that `` the education of all Americans must be rooted in the self-evident truths of Western civilization'' - a proposition that has been assailed on some college campuses. `` Since the founding of this nation, education and democracy have gone hand in hand,'' he said. `` Every American is the inheritor of our great cultural tradition,'' he said. `` That's why I have supported and continue to support all efforts to reach our children about our culture, to read great texts and learn their lessons.''

<HEAD>Rancher Wins Libel Judgment Over Deaths Of Pesticide-Sprayed
Cattle</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DAVIS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A rancher who lost 500 cows after they were sprayed with a since-banned pesticide has won a $ 7 million libel judgment stemming from a university report blaming all but one of the deaths on improper care. The chancellor of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said Friday that an appeal is planned of a jury's $ 7 million award to <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Neary </PERSON> of <PERSON> Chico </PERSON>. After a four-month trial, an <LOCATION> Alameda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> jury decided Thursday in favor of <PERSON> Neary </PERSON> for a <ORGANIZATION> UC-Davis </ORGANIZATION> report quoting investigators as saying that the 1979 deaths of 500 of <PERSON> Neary </PERSON>'s cattle resulted from inadequate feeding and care The report concluded that only one death was due to the state's spraying of toxaphene to fight a feared infestation of scabies mites Against <PERSON> Neary </PERSON>'s wishes, the pesticide was sprayed by <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> veterinarians on a herd of cattle he had recently bought in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and transported to his ranch 10 miles north of <LOCATION> Chico </LOCATION>. In 1982, the federal <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> banned most uses of toxaphene. The chemical has been linked to cancer in humans. <PERSON> Neary </PERSON> contended the <ORGANIZATION> UC-Davis </ORGANIZATION> report libeled him by depicting him as an incompetent rancher and implying that his ranching practices led to his cattle's deaths. <PERSON> Neary </PERSON>'s lead attorney, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Keker </PERSON>, said the three veterinarians named in the lawsuit lied in their report to protect the university's close ties with state veterinarians as well as the chemical and beef industries. `` It looked like science, but actually it was science fiction,'' he said. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> Chancellor <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hullar </PERSON> said officials there were `` stunned to learn of the jury's verdict.'' `` The expert opinion requested of our veterinary professors was offered in good faith and after a rigorous and objective study,'' he said. `` Their field investigations and laboratory analyses were thorough, their conclusions soundly reasoned and their conduct above reproach.'' <PERSON> Hullar </PERSON> said the decision would be appealed and the university would not allow it to `` deter our involvement in other potentially controversial areas requiring impartial and expert analysis.'' The veterinarians were <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> McCapes </PERSON>, assistant dean of the <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterinary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>, and faculty members <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Hjerpe </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>. They have a libel suit pending against <PERSON> Neary </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> for comments he made in a `` 60 Minutes'' program. After the verdict, <PERSON> Neary </PERSON> said the UC system `` has been covering up for these murders too long. Animals, rivers, women, Mexican farmworkers are all being poisoned. It's been going on too long and it's got to be stopped.'' <PERSON> Neary </PERSON> sought $ 12 million in the lawsuit, which was heard in <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> because the UC system headquarters are located in nearby <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Neary </PERSON> also has a suit pending in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Fresno </LOCATION> against state veterinarians who sprayed the toxaphene at his ranch.

<TEXT>
 Here is the text of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s radio address Saturday: My fellow Americans, it's September, a time when our children once again return to school bright with promise and eager for instruction. I'm happy to report that if the record of the past eight years is any indication, the prospects for their education are bright; brighter than they've been for more than two decades. Test scores are up, reversing a calamitous drop in scores over the years between 1963 and 1980. Attendance is up, and the number of kids who drop out of high school is down. The recovery of our schools has been a genuine grassroots accomplishment and it proves the solution to problems is not to throw money at them, but to come up with commonsense answers and start applying them. I'm proud that during our administration, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and I have been there with a sympathetic ear and a helping hand. But we've only just begun Far too many American students are graduating from school without the skills they will need to prosper and the knowledge they'll need to grow as adults. And no one knows this better than <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s parents who rose up at the beginning of the decade and said, `` Our children are not getting the education they want, need and deserve.'' The education our children want is the ability to discover the answers to the basic questions we all have: Who am I? Where do I live, and what is the world around me like? Children yearn to learn and their capacity for it is one of the God-given wonders. The education our children need is the ability to read, write and reason as well as any student in any country in the world. They need it and the nation needs it as well if we're to prosper and grow. The education our children deserve is the kind no American should be deprived of, for it's the basic instruction in what it means to be an American. I believe that the education of all Americans must be rooted in the self-evident truths of western civilization. These are the truths that have been passed down like precious heirlooms from generation to generation since the generations began. Since the founding of this nation, education and democracy have gone hand in hand. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> not only wrote the Declaration of Independence and served as our third president, but also founded one of our most distinguished institutions of higher learning _ the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> and the founders believed a nation that governs itself like ours must rely upon an informed and engaged electorate. Their purpose was not only to teach all Americans how to read and write, but to instill the self-evident truths that are the anchors of our political system, truths, to quote <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON>, such as `` All men are created equal,'' that `` they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights,'' that `` among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness.'' This is our precious heritage and our political freedoms, the freedom to speak, to practice our religions, to assemble peacefully, are the product of ideas that were born and nurtured in the great tradition of western civilization. That tradition does not say some men have these rights. It says all men, everywhere on this earth whether of <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION>, Hispanic or African, dissent, no matter what color. Every American is the inheritor of our great cultural tradition. That's why I've supported and continue to support all efforts to teach our children about our culture, to read great texts and learn their lessons. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, our secretary of education, has just reported on the state of elementary education in our country. That report, entitled, `` <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Madison </PERSON> Elementary Schools,'' presents an outline for what every elementary school curriculum should include. It is suffused with the glory of western civilization and I salute it. We owe our children no less than to instruct them in what <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> called, `` The best that has been known and said.'' And yet just as forcefully I want to say that this curriculum is only a guideline for school districts to follow if they think it right. The final arbiter of what a child should learn is not the state, but the family and the community in which the child lives. And so I support the right of all parents to choose the education they believe is best for their children in the form of magnet schools and state programs like <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>'s which permits parents to choose which schools their children can attend. In addition, programs like Youth 2000, which teaches kids to rely on themselves and to say no to drugs are vital in our efforts. Yes, we're blessed to be the recipients of this cultural bounty, and we must be responsibile too. As the Constitution says, `` secure the blessings to our posterity.'' Until next week, thanks for listening and God bless you.

 Here is the text of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> response to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s radio address Saturday, given by Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>: This week millions of American children went back to These young people represent <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s future. Today, I want to take issue with what the president has been saying about education. Let's set the record straight. For seven years now the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the administration have been working on our arithmetic. The administration subtracts from education. The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> adds to save it. For seven years now we Democrats have been trying to educate the administration about the value of education. It has n't helped. I'm not surprised. This White House has never had a real commitment to excellence in education. I do n't understand why the administration has n't done its homework. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s future economic prosperity depends on having the best educated workforce in the world. Put simply, an educated <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is a strong <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Just two days ago the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Competitiveness </ORGANIZATION> stated that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is developing an `` ominous'' dependence on foreign professors and researchers. Forty percent of all engineering students graduating from American colleges and universities are now foreign-born. We now import brains and intellectual talent the same way that we import cars and radios. Why do we rely so heavily on foreign talent? Because our schools are not teaching our children the math and science skills they need for our new high-tech economy. And that's not all. According to a recent survey, 75 percent of all American students could not locate the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> on a world map. The alarm has been sounded again and again. Yet nothing has been done by the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to link <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s economic future to rebuilding our nation's educational system. Nothing at all. This White House talks a lot about the three R's. But when it comes to helping education, their three R's amount to rhetoric, reductions and retrenchment. If the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> had its way, <PERSON> Pell </PERSON> grants would be cut by 40 percent, college work study programs would end, vocational education would stop altogether, and aid to graduate school students would come to a halt. Even the `` drug free'' school program would be cut by 50 percent. My friends, this is terribly wrong. It used to be that a high-school diploma was the guarantee of a good job and the chance to marry and settle down. Now, even our high school graduates are struggling. Put simply, you ca n't get ahead unless you have the best education possible. But getting a good college education is almost out of reach for these young Americans and for millions of other Americans. There are hundreds of thousands of middle-class families struggling to make ends meet, so they can send their children to college. They want their children to get ahead _ to be a part of an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> dream. But in the last seven years their sacrifice has gone unrewarded. Even though college tuitions have risen by 60 percent since 1981, again and again the administration has tried to cut student aid. I have had to vote 14 times in the last seven years to protect student loan programs. Fourteen times! And, when it comes to doing something about adult illiteracy, the White House blackboard is completely blank. Twenty-three million Americans are now functionally illiterate. How difficult it must be to live a life when you can not read and write; when you can not read the Bible, or a story to your children, or even the funny pages in the newspaper. Yet, these illiterate Americans are the very Americans who can make the difference, if <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is to stay No. 1. If we want <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to be strong in every way, we need to recognize that smart students are just as important as smart weapons. In my home state of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, the students who answered my annual survey know that too! Forty percent of them rated education as the first priority of the federal government. We need leadership in the White House that appreciates the value of education as much as do the young people of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. I am encouraged that at least one of the presidential candidates has made a pledge that no college student should be turned away from college because they ca n't get financial aid. The education formula for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s future prosperity is clear: good schools equal a smart workforce and that adds up to an <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> that is still the best. Let's do our homework now, so we do n't flunk later. In this course <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> ca n't afford to fail. Thank you and may God bless you.

 A millionaire grandfather landed a 330-pound airplane in his homeland Saturday after a 23-day flight from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> that set a record for ultralight aviation. <PERSON> Vijaypat </PERSON> <PERSON> Singhania </PERSON>'s ultralight plane made a perfect landing at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Safdarjung </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> at 11:10 a.m. <PERSON> Singhania </PERSON>, 49, took off from <LOCATION> Biggin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Kent </LOCATION> on Aug. 18. The red-and-white fiberglass aircraft flew 6,000 miles through high winds and sandstorms and over hundreds of miles of open sea. <PERSON> Singhania </PERSON> said he fought depression, heat sores and a steady weight loss in the hours spent in the cramped cockpit of the cone-shaped plane. The 21-feet long plane has a one-half-horsepower engine and a wingspan of 32 feet. Its top speed is about 60 mph. `` Flying at 10,000 feet over the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>, I saw ships and tried to visualize how long it would take for them to pick me up if I fell in,'' the bespectacled, balding industrialist said at the airport. `` I had a lifejacket strapped on, shark repellent by my side and kept talking to my granddaughter's picture that was strapped on to the front of my cockpit to keep myself from going crazy.'' He said he lost 24 pounds during the trip. <PERSON> Singhania </PERSON>, the head of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s third-largest business group, beat a 34-day speed record set over the same course this year by a British television journalist, <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Milton </PERSON>. <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> to greet <PERSON> Singhania </PERSON> at the end of the flight. `` There have been only five long flights -LRB- above 5,000 miles -RRB- undertaken in a microlight aircraft,'' he said. `` Anyone who attempts such a flight will have to beat <PERSON> Vijay </PERSON> to make the record.'' The plane is named L'Espirit d'Indian Post, after a Bombay-based newspaper owned by the Singhania group. <PERSON> Singhania </PERSON> said the name was a combination of his `` two passions'' _ the spirit of adventure and his newspaper. `` I wanted to try and break the record. I wanted to be an ambassador for my country and show people <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> is not just a country of snake charmers,'' he said. `` I am very proud to have established <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> on the aviation map and feel tremendously thrilled that I managed to so positively portray the indomitable spirit latent in all men, the spirit of adventure,'' <PERSON> Singhania </PERSON> said. `` And not least of all, I was running out of stories to tell my grandchildren _ now I have a fund of tales.''

From <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will head for some major industrial states on an itinerary that includes <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> before he returns home by Friday. `` I mean to win this election,'' a newly energized <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> repeatedly declared against highly telegenic backgrounds. At each event, campaign aides carefully checked camera angles to give photographers and television cameramen the best shots. With public opinion surveys showing him edging ahead of Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> seemed more confident and at ease on the stump. He rejected charges that he was waging a negative campaign. His campaign message was tailored to fit the place and the audience. Wooing conservative Democrats in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was a hardliner on abortion, the death penalty, gun control and prison furloughs. He pounced on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> again for vetoing a bill aimed at requiring public school teachers to lead students in reciting the Pledge of Allegiance. Attacking <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as `` a card-carrying member of the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION>'' and `` a progressive, liberal Democrat,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` It's time to have a Texan in the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, one who shares your values.'' It was a different message that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> brought to <LOCATION> Rockford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, for an address Friday before 200 members of the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> Women. Observing that women earn an average 70 cents for every dollar earned by men, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` There's only one amount that a woman should earn for every dollar earned by a man _ and that is one dollar.'' In an apparent departure from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's policy of opposing parental job leaves, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> declared, `` We also need to assure that women do n't have to worry about getting their jobs back after having a child or caring for a child during a serious illness.'' He did not specify what he had in mind. He reiterated in an interview that he opposes abortion except in cases of rape, incest or when the mother's life is threatened. Significantly, however, he said his opposition to abortion is `` not a litmus test that everybody has to agree with.'' Most polls show a majority of Americans are pro-choice. In another important election-year shift aimed at winning blue-collar votes, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also signaled he is ready to endorse an increase in the minimum wage, which has been frozen at $ 3.35 an hour for seven years. The Democrats already are moving an increase through <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill proposes an increase to $ 4.55 by 1991, while a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> bill proposes $ 5.05 by 1992. `` I'm talking to some of our experts and I'm going to do what's fair,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said He said he would insist on some minimum-wage differential, perhaps a training wage or a sub-minimum wage for teen-agers. Trying to duplicate President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s success at gaining coverage on the TV evening news shows, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> went to great lengths to appear in colorful settings for the cameras. He stained his tie filleting a white sea bass at a wholesale fish company in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, paraded with <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Mouse </PERSON> at <LOCATION> Disneyland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, confronted a jeering union crowd at a <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, shipyard, watched the fiery destruction of nuclear-missile engines in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and appeared at the <ORGANIZATION> Marigold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Festival </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Pekin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>. To keep the focus on themes of his choosing, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not hold any news conferences with the campaign press corps last week He ignored a reporter who used a traffic cone as a megaphone to shout questions. Not everything went <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s way, though. In <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> flubbed by telling an American Legion convention that Sept. 7 _ instead of Dec. 7 _ was the anniversary of the Japanese attack on <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>. Another embarrassment was the disclosure that <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Brentar </PERSON>, co-chairman of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'88 <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalities </ORGANIZATION>, was a defender of former <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> autoworker <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>, who was convicted in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> as a Nazi war criminal. <PERSON> Brentar </PERSON> resigned under fire.

 Hundreds of radical students yelling slogans against the Olympics and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> battled riot police with firebombs and rocks Saturday. About 2,000 students from a dozen colleges took part in a rally at <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Yonsei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> to denounce the Olympics and President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON>'s government. Many shouted `` Yankee go home.'' Some burned an effigy of an American wearing the Stars and Stripes. `` Oppose the Olympics that squeeze out the blood of the masses,'' shouted a radical leader as protesters chanted slogans against the Games, scheduled to begin in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> Sept. 17. Police said they had no reports of arrests or injuries. Students also clashed with police at <ORGANIZATION> Yonsei </ORGANIZATION> Friday in an anti-Olympic protest. Students marched out of the school to confront hundreds of riot police surrounding the campus in the western part of the city. Protesters, some armed with iron and wood clubs, taunted police and then attacked them with firebombs and rocks. `` Oppose the dictatorial Olympics'' and `` Down with the military dictatorship,'' protesters chanted. Waves of masked students rushed out of the school's gates and climbed over walls to pelt police with firebombs that exploded in orange balls of blazing gasoline, setting fire to some troopers' shields and clothing But police did not use tear gas because of a government ban during the Olympics. Police also hurled back fewer rocks than normal in an apparent attempt to limit violence. Police charged the protesters a few times, but remained on the defensive most of the time. The fighting lasted about 30 minutes and was confined to the road in front of the school. Radical students have called for widespread anti-Olympic protests, but they have been confined to a few campuses in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> and some other cities. There have been no demonstrations near the Olympic venues. Student leaders told a rally before the clash with police that the <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> government was using the Olympics to solidify authoritarian rule. The leaders said the Olympics should not be staged unless they helped to promote democracy. `` The Olympics are being used to cement the fascist regime,'' said a statement by the protesters. `` The regime is making all-out efforts to weaken the people's power.'' Speakers charged the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was conspiring with <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> to continue military rule. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has about 42,000 troops stationed in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> under a mutual defense pact. National Assembly Speaker <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Chae-sun </PERSON>, in a speech Saturday to the opening session of the legislature's new session, said the overwhelming majority of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Koreans </LOCATION> support the Olympics. The radicals, a small but powerful minority on campuses, have virtually no public support. Most South Koreans are critical of radical protests against the Olympics and want nothing to disrupt the Games. Radical students contend the <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> administration is a front for continued military rule and say they are determined to topple the government. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>, a former general who won a presidential election in December, has introduced broad political reforms and dismantled authoritarian controls. In another development Saturday, aides to former President <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON> said he canceled plans to attend the opening ceremonies of the Olympics. <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> has been accused of corrpution by the opposition. The aides quoted <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> as saying he did not want to cause trouble at the Games and would stay away despite government plans to invite him as an honored guest. Olympic organizers have invited <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> as one of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s three living former presidents, and government officials have said <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>'s role in bringing the Games to <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> justified the invitation The invitation triggered a strong opposition backlash. <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>, who seized power with military backing in 1980, has faced a parliamentary inquiry for alleged corruption and other wrongdoing during his administration. <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> left office in February after a seven-year term.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> on Saturday expelled a Vietnamese diplomat who brandished a gun outside his embassy during a demonstration by opponents of the <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> government. The Foreign Office said Vietnamese Third Secretary Khang Than Nhan must leave <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> by midnight Sunday. The Vietnamese Embassy said no official would be available to comment during the weekend. Vietnamese Ambassador <PERSON> Tran </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Hung </PERSON>, pressed by the British government about <PERSON> Khang </PERSON>'s actions during the Sept. 4 protest, turned over a toy gun on Thursday. But on Saturday he produced a real gun and gave it to the British Foreign Office. <PERSON> Tran </PERSON> acknowledged that <PERSON> Khang </PERSON> was holding the gun when he confronted demonstrating Vietnamese refugees in front of the embassy, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Tran </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> that his government regretted the incident and recognized that it constituted a breach of British and Vietnamese regulations. But <PERSON> Tran </PERSON> said that in keeping with <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s invariable practice, the embassy would not grant a waiver of <PERSON> Khang </PERSON>'s diplomatic immunity to enable <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> to prosecute him On Thursday, the <LOCATION> Vietnamese </LOCATION> ambassador initially agreed that <PERSON> Khang </PERSON> would give up his immunity. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> would not accept nomination of a successor to <PERSON> Khang </PERSON> until it received a full account of the disciplinary proceedings <PERSON> Khang </PERSON> would face. At the Sept. 4 embassy incident, demonstrators took photographs of <PERSON> Khang </PERSON>, which were published in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said last week it took a very serious view of the incident and warned the ambassador of the `` gravest consequences'' unless the diplomat's immunity was waived. Diplomatic missions in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> are not allowed to keep arms, and the government has taken violations seriously since a gunman firing from the Libyan Embassy killed a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> policewoman during a demonstration in April 1984. After a police siege of the embassy, the building was closed and diplomatic relations severed.

 Cartoonist <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Larson </PERSON>, whose `` The Far Side'' comic appears in more than 800 newspapers, will take a 14-month break from his work beginning this fall, his syndicate said Saturday. `` Even revolutionaries need to refuel,'' <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Syndicate </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McMeel </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Larson </PERSON>, 38, who lives in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, will stop distributing new cartoons Oct. 30 and will begin again Jan. 1, 1990. <PERSON> Larson </PERSON>, who has said in the past that he sits down at his drawing table and `` gets silly,'' is famous for cartoons about cows that honk at humans, dinosaurs that smoke and woman with beehive hairdos. In one cartoon showing a step in evolution, three fish, one carrying a baseball bat, prepare to step from the sea for the first time to retrieve a baseball sitting on the shore. In another, a rattlesnake with a pointer in its mouth lectures a class of other snakes, showing them a chart of a man's leg with a boot.

 Faced with $ 1 million-a-day fines and layoffs of hundreds of municipal workers, the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> approved a court-ordered housing desegregation plan Saturday after two members switched their votes. As an emotional crowd looked on, the council approved the plan by a 5-2 vote about 1:30 a.m., after a month in which escalating fines for refusing to endorse the plan threatened the state's fourth-largest city with bankruptcy Secretary of State <PERSON> Gail </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaffer </PERSON>, head of the state board that took control of the city's finances, suspended the layoffs of 447 city employees after the vote. `` This morning, the healing process begins,'' she said. `` A new chapter in the history of <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION> can and must begin.'' Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said the council `` did the right thing.'' Two of the four councilmen who had long opposed the plan voted for it after city officials negotiated a modified plan with the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> that would mix some of the low-income units ordered by the court with more expensive ones. City officials planned to ask <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Sand </PERSON> to adopt the modified plan in place of his original order, which he had enforced with fines that hit $ 1 million a day Friday. The vote came as opposition to Sand's plan was starting to wane. Uncollected garbage sits outside many homes, children went to school without crossing guards, and the three town libraries were scheduled to close. `` In the past, we have thought of those fines somewhat in the abstract. ... The abstract has now become a reality,'' said Councilman <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Longo </PERSON>, one of those who changed his vote. `` The thing that most affected me was looking over a list of people who at the stroke of midnight would become unemployed.'' <PERSON> Longo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Chema </PERSON>, the other councilman who switched, prefaced their vote with long speeches in which they noted that Sand had said he would not agree to any changes in the plan unless the council first approved it unchanged. One woman yelled `` You little snake!'' at Chema, while another man screeched at Mayor <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wasicsko </PERSON>, `` You sold us out, <PERSON> Nicky </PERSON>! We'll remember!'' The mayor also voted for the plan. After the vote, about 100 spectators noisily filed out of the council chamber, some cheering, some cursing. `` I think they sold our constitutional rights out,'' yelled <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Roland </PERSON>. Another resident, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON>, said, `` It's wonderful for the city of <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION> to be in compliance and following the law. The fines had started at $ 100 and doubled each day, reaching a cumulative total of more than $ 1.6 million paid through Thursday. The desegregation lawsuit was brought by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in 1980 and joined by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> for the Advancement of Colored People. Three years ago Sand ordered an end to segregated housing and schools in <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION>. On Aug. 2, he found the city of 194,000 in contempt for the council's refusal to carry out a housing desegregation order. The housing plan calls for 200 units of low-income public housing scattered through mainly white neighborhoods and 800 units of middle-income, subsidized housing. Councilmen <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Spallone </PERSON> and <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Fagan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> continued to oppose the plan and voted against it. Sand had threatened all four defiant council members with fines and jail terms for contempt, but the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> stayed the action earlier this month. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Toole </PERSON>, president of the anti-plan Save <ORGANIZATION> Yonkers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>, said Saturday his group had hired a lawyer and would continue to fight the plan.

Later, they will confront humiliation. Then, when things go wrong in later life, <PERSON> Matson </PERSON> said, `` They'll understand those are natural, normal sensations and by knowing that, they'll be more confident to forge ahead. <PERSON> Matson </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> engineering professor, is on loan to the business school for the 1988-89 academic year. His `` Failure 101'' course was selected from among 158 competitors for the Zell-Laurie Fellowship visiting professorship, intended to develop courses to foster entrepreneurship. It is based on a series of `` hurdle-jumping exercises'' that confront students with repeated failures. <PERSON> Matson </PERSON>, 46, said the idea sprang from unusual events in his own life. At 40, he was hit in the head by a bolt of lightning while playing tennis, and that freed him from a `` straitjacketed'' academic life, he said. `` There was nothing wrong with me physically, but psychologically I still felt dead,'' he said. He decided he was having a midlife crisis and began exploring his creativity. `` I started to feel that success is somewhat predicated on a nest of failures. That's how we learn. If we really want to succeed, we have to take risks,'' he said. In his first class, on Monday, <PERSON> Matson </PERSON> plans to conduct a contest to see which student can produce the most ridiculous laugh. He wants to create a spontaneous, playful atmosphere. `` I want to teach them how to generate ideas, and bring out these things that are inside of them, but have been suppressed during their entire academic careers'' because of fear of failure, he said.

<HEAD>Another 4,000 Jobs Go; Incredible Shrinking Airline?</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Money-losing <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> eliminated 4,000 more jobs Saturday in the `` downsizing'' it says it needs to survive, but the unions charged that the cutbacks are actually making the airline less competitive. The cuts, which are being contested in court by the unions, reduced <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s workforce to fewer than 30,000. Less than four years ago, it had 42,000 workers. Eastern eliminated 12 percent of its routes two weeks ago, ending service to 14 cities. Laid-off workers with seniority can transfer to other cities, `` bumping'' newer employees out of their jobs. Thus, newer employees could take the brunt of the layoffs when the bumping is complete. The mood around work gates was sullen. `` We've had very few who have already gotten their layoff notices, but we've heard there are about 80 who have shown intentions of bumping,'' said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON>, a union chief steward representing ramp agents. `` So a lot of these people do n't know what to expect.'' `` The people are devastated,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, president of the Machinists local, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s largest union with nearly 12,000 members. `` It's a traumatic thing to lose your job when you've just gotten your children started in school.'' Of the 4,000 jobs eliminated, 1,500 were non-union positions, including management and clerical. Among the 4,000 are few hundred flight attendants, mechanics, baggage handlers and ramp agents who are taking early retirement or quitting, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> said. `` The fact is we have lost over a billion dollars in this decade,'' said <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Matell </PERSON>, the company's chief spokesman. `` We have to take prudent, although admittedly painful, measures.'' Eastern, which lost $ 182 million in 1987 and $ 149 million in the first half of 1988 and is $ 2.5 billion in debt, estimates it will save $ 100 million a year with the latest cuts. Eastern was taken over more than two years ago by Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Union members have accused <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> of stripping <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s assets in favor of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>'s sister airline, <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>, which has been non-union since <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> took it into bankruptcy reorganization in 1983 The unions say downsizing the carrier dooms Eastern to decreasing ability to compete. Laying off employees drives up labor costs per flight because less-senior workers being laid off are paid less than those who remain, they said. `` The last thing you want to do in the airline industry is downsize,'' <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> said. `` Many of the costs are fixed, and the break-even yield goes way up. It's a lose-lose proposition that just feeds on itself. `` <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> is using typical robber baron strategy to plunder the company and try to make all the cash he can.'' Eastern's unions will argue against the layoffs later this month in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, which allowed <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> to cut the jobs if it posted a $ 4.7 million bond to cover wages if workers are later reinstated. The appeals court earlier his month set aside an injunction by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Barrington </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, who had barred Eastern from eliminating the jobs without negotiating with its unions. Machinists' members will vote Thursday on a management demand for $ 161 million in cuts. The union and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> have been in federal mediation since January.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Hays </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirby </PERSON> refused to be run off by the sheriff when his town was ordered evacuated, but he realizes that nearby forest fires might succeed where the law failed. The owner of the 20-room <ORGANIZATION> Grizzly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lodge </ORGANIZATION> just to the east of <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION>'s northeast entrance has watched forest fires burn to the north, south and east of this mountain hamlet. Saturday, he waited for flames from the <LOCATION> Storm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> fire some three miles to the west to be fanned into Silver Gate. `` We're going to burn up. They ca n't stop this fire,'' <PERSON> Kirby </PERSON>, 45, said Saturday while finicky breeze whipped the American flag outside his front door. `` If the wind blows, we're going to blow up.'' Forecasts of wind blowing up to 60 mph had been dropped, although meteorologists still said gusts to 40 mph were possible. But a steady rain fell at mid-day. Forest fires have charred more than 1 million acres _ 300,000 acres on Friday alone _ in <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> and its surrounding national forests since late June. To <PERSON> Kirby </PERSON>, a wiry man who flies F-16 fighters in the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> and who has made this tiny community home for eight years, the fires are an unnecessary tragedy. `` This fire laid up in a place we call <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Abundance </LOCATION> for days and days, and you could have driven ... you could have driven fire trucks in there and put this fire out,'' he said. But Lake Abundance is in the <LOCATION> Absaroka-Beartooth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wilderness </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Area </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Custer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION> just north of Silver Gate. Machinery is not allowed in wilderness areas and natural fires are allowed to burn without man's interference. Since it left the wilderness area, firefighters have been unable to halt the fire. A backfire started last week to eliminate fuel between Silver Gate and the Storm Creek fire reversed directions and burned east along the ridge running east and west above <LOCATION> Silver </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gate </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cooke </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Several homes and outbuildings were destroyed by the flames. `` There was no necessity for burning these communities up,'' <PERSON> Kirby </PERSON> said again. Since mid-August, these two sleepy towns that funnel summertime tourists in and out of <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> and winter sportsmen into the surrounding mountains have acted mainly as fire camps. About 100 people call Silver Gate and <LOCATION> Cooke </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> home throughout the year, but the fires have brought 450 to 500 men and women in to fight the fires. The Storm Creek fire camp just to the east of <LOCATION> Cooke </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> holds an additional 1,100. `` I live here. My life is here, my family is here,'' said <PERSON> Kirby </PERSON>, who believes he and his immediate family are the only full-time Silver Gate residents who have held their ground. `` I just could n't leave I just ... I do n't know. I really thought that we could get a handle on this fire.'' While some other residents had come back, he said, they were ordered to leave quickly. `` They -LRB- the authorities -RRB- came in and were going to remove them from their homes at gunpoint. Oh yes, absolutely, at gunpoint if necessary,'' <PERSON> Kirby </PERSON> said. `` <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> law, to my knowledge, does not allow for that. I know they've looked for me quite a lot. I just have n't been available.'' In nearby <LOCATION> Cooke </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bernie </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiley </PERSON> have been able to stay to run their store, the <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. The Kileys could lose everything they've worked for the past 17 years if the Storm Creek fire hits them. Their investment in the trading post is about $ 250,000, and their adjoining home is worth about $ 100,000. Their fire insurance wo n't come close to covering the losses, they say. `` I guess we're naive,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Kiley </PERSON> said. `` The park -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- would n't let us burn because they put us in this situation. Besides, we could n't pack it all up and take it.''

 Sheriff <PERSON> Gervase </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> was a little embarrassed after discovering his radio campaign advertisements were made by a fugitive being sought by his department on an outstanding warrant. According to court records, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Moody </PERSON>, an ex-disc jockey and resort operator, was being sought on felony theft and misdemeanor obstruction of justice charges when he recorded several radio ads for <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> this week. `` I thought it was all settled,'' the <LOCATION> Juneau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff said Friday. `` I thought he had worked things out with the district attorney and the court.'' <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said Saturday that authorities had been informed <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION> had moved to <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> and thus should not be considered a fugitive. `` The district attorney's office knew where <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> was. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> was not a fugitive,'' <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said. `` He left <LOCATION> Juneau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> apparently some time before any paperwork was issued.'' But a bench warrant was issued for <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION> on Aug. 16, after he failed a second time to appear on the charges in a 4-year-old theft case. According to the criminal complaint signed by <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION> confessed in June to taking a safe from the Port O' Call Resort that he and his father, <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Moody </PERSON>, operated on <LOCATION> Castle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> in 1984. The younger <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION> had initially reported that the safe and its contents, valued at more than $ 3,000, had been taken during a burglary. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, who faces a re-election challenge in Tuesday's primary, said he did not pay <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION> for the radio spots, which aired for the first time Friday <LOCATION> Juneau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> District Attorney <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindberg </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION> has volunteered to turn himself in Monday.

 An apple a day may keep the doctor away, but communities hoping to lure physicians to their small towns passed out the tempting fruit at the 10th annual Doctors Fair at the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>. `` I guess we're feeling like an apple a day keeps the doctor at home or something,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Record </PERSON>, an assistant dean at the medical school who organized the fair. The medical students and residents who trekked through the tent adjacent to the school last week could get information about jobs and incentive packages offered by towns like <LOCATION> Sandwich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>; hospitals in larger communities like <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION>; and even the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. Dr. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a former SIU med school student who was lured to the west-central <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> community of <LOCATION> Pittsfield </LOCATION> partly because of the doctors fair, said he returned to the fair this year to get assistance. `` I'm dying for help,'' said <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a family practitioner. He said he is the only doctor who delivers babies in <LOCATION> Pike </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, population 19,000, and works as many as 110 hours a week. `` On the third day that you go to the hospital before your kids get up and get home after they're in bed, it gets real hard to go to work,'' he said. They were n't just handing out apples at the fair. Medical students, residents or physicians hoping to change jobs could pick up an armful of brochures as well as such trinkets at coffee mugs, visors, candy, cookies, note pads, key chains or even roses to pin on a lapel. `` We give one to all the students and hope that they think we're a class-act hospital,'' said <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Marmorstone </PERSON>, administrator at <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Litchfield </LOCATION>, population 7,200 Representatives from <ORGANIZATION> Sandwich </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> offered fake $ 100 bills beneath a sign that said `` Come to where the money is. Sandwich, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>.'' The hospital was offering doctors an incentive package that includes a guaranteed $ 100,000 salary for the first year as well as free office space, paid malpractice insurance and loans for office equipment. `` I talked to one individual who just said how he would pay off my student loans. ... They'd give me two years free rent in some office building,'' said fourth-year <ORGANIZATION> SIU </ORGANIZATION> medical student <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Zenker </PERSON>, 25. `` When you're about $ 40,000 in debt, you kind of think of a few things like that,'' he said. Dr. <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Page </PERSON>, a resident at <ORGANIZATION> SIU </ORGANIZATION>, said there was a lot of interest in her specialty _ obstetrics and gynecology, apparently because so many physicians are leaving that field because of spiraling malpractice insurance costs. `` I just had a man who said I was golden anytime, anywhere,'' she said. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallhaus </PERSON>, a third-year medical student, said he had no qualms about starting his career in a small town. `` It's kind of tempting to think that you're going to be the guy in charge of the medicine in some town,'' he said. `` That's tempting.

 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> on Saturday accused <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and other forces of destablizing the region, criticized apartheid and called for the release of black nationalist <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>. The Roman Catholic leader, at the start of a 10-day tour of southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, also urged the people of the region to renounce violence. `` Powerful political, economic and ideological forces endanger the still fragile stability of countries which are only beginning to consolidate their recently acquired independence,'' the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> said in an arrival speech. `` Those forces impede the self-determination of peoples, they foment ideological, ethnic and tribal conflicts, they delay the process of development.'' The pope did not mention any country by name, but he said his comments were `` true for the grave issue of apartheid,'' <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s policy of racial segregation. He told journalists accompanying him on the papal flight from <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> that apartheid was `` a racist ideology.'' Hundreds of Zimbabweans cheered wildly as the pope appeared at the door of his <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alitalia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747, descended a stairway and kneeled to kiss the soil in his traditional arrival gesture. Later, thousands of waving and cheering people stood along the <PERSON> pope </PERSON>'s motorcade route from <LOCATION> Harare </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> to downtown. At the airport, President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON>, one of the nearly 1 million Catholics in this country of 8.5 million people, waited at the edge of a red carpet to greet the pope. Traditional dancers and church choirs gave <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> a festive welcome to start his 39th tour abroad and fourth visit to <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> since he became head of the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> 10 years ago. The pope's three-day trip to <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> is the first stop on the his five-nation tour of southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, his first visit to the politically troubled region. The other countries he will visit are <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Swaziland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>. The five countries are among the youngest in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, and 8-year-old <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> is the youngest. The southern states oppose white-led <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s racial segregation policy, but must depend on the economically and militarily powerful neighbor for economic survival. The <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> government asked <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> to include <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> on his current tour, but the invitation was rejected. Even though he is avoiding <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, the tour is expected to be one of the most politically charged trips by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, the most widely-traveled pope in history. Speaking to reporters aboard the plane taking him to <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>, the former white-ruled British colony of <LOCATION> Rhodesia </LOCATION>, the 68-year-old pontiff expressed hope that a future papal trip to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> would trigger changes. But he said no date had been set for such a trip. He also stopped short of endorsing an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> sanctions bill that mandates disinvestment by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and a near-total trade embargo. After his <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> speech, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> told bishops from the region, gathered at a Dominican convent, that he prayed every day for the release of <LOCATION> Mandela </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, the 70-year-old leader of the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, has refused to sign a statement renouncing use of violence as a condition for his release from South African detention. `` I ask for his freedom every day ... It must take place ... I am full of admiration for him. I am proud of his firmness,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> is the major guerrilla group fighting the South African government. Under apartheid, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services. The pope also told the bishops that `` only a negotiated settlement of differences can bring true peace and justice'' in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` A loss of confidence in the possibility of a peaceful solution could easily lead to further frustration and violence, increasing the threat to peace, not limited to this region,'' he said. He endorsed the U.S.-mediated regional peace talks between <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> that seek the departure of 50,000 Cubans from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and have led to the withdrawal of South African troops involved in the 13-year-long civil war. The talks also seek to bring independence to <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, known as <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>.

 The Chamber of Deputies on Saturday confirmed <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> as president-elect after bitter protests by opponents who charged he won through massive fraud. Leftist deputies chanted `` Electoral fraud! Electoral fraud!'' as they walked out of the all-night session that ended in a 263-85 vote for <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>. Almost all the votes to certify the results of the July 6 election came from members of <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>' ruling <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION>. `` In no way is he the president of the Mexicans,'' said <PERSON> Octavio </PERSON> <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON>, a deputy of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. After his confirmation, <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> accepted congratulations from supporters at his office, telling them, `` Thanks. Onward,'' as he shook their hands. `` <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> has to grow again and will grow again, because it's the only way to raise our countrymen's standard of living,'' he told reporters. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> begins his six-year presidential term on Dec. 1, succeeding President <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>. The raucous scene in the chamber capped 3 -LCB- weeks of stormy debate over the election results, during which the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> brushed aside claims of ballot fraud. In the elections, the opposition, made up of the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> and the rightist <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, made its strongest gains ever in the <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. But critics claim that only massive cheating allowed the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> to retain its 59-year grip on power. At the Saturday morning session of the <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> delegates walked out before <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> delegates pushed through a roll call confirming the official election results and cutting off debate. During the vote, <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> supporters shouted `` <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>, <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>, <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>.'' National Action delegates walked out after voting `` no.'' The election was declared valid, with <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> winning 50.74 percent of the vote, <PERSON> Cuauhtemoc </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> 31.06 percent and <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Clouthier </PERSON> of National Action 16.81 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> and the government have consistently rejected opposition charges that the elections were fraudulent. `` What they are seeking is to destabilize the government and degrade the republic, its institutions and its politics,'' a <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> statement said as the confirmation session began Friday. <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON>, leader of a democratic reform movement, said the confirmation session was the last chance for the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> and the government to set a fraud-tainted election right. `` <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> lost all its opportunities to legitimize the election,'' said <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON>, a delegate from the state of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. He called <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> a `` usurper.'' In mid-August, the 500-member chamber began its session as an electoral college to certify the winners of the legislative elections. On Friday, the delegates began the process of certifying the winner of the presidential race. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> was the architect of an austere economic policy that successfully fought inflation and helped the nation recover from near bankruptcy, but also devastated the average Mexican's buying power. A crowd of opposition supporters who gathered outside the <ORGANIZATION> Legislative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palace </ORGANIZATION> slowly dispersed after the vote. <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> and <PERSON> Clouthier </PERSON> said they plan to lead more demonstrations next week, when <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> celebrates the anniversary of its independence from <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. `` Until now, we have n't gone as far as the people want,'' said <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON>. He refused to elaborate.

 Heavy rains pushed flood waters to higher levels Saturday, and authorities struggled to get food and medicine to millions of people marooned by the record deluge. In the countryside, almost 185,000 people have become sick with diarrhea after drinking contaminated water and more than 110 of them died, government health officials said. The flood waters covering three-quarters of the country have swept away houses and people, claiming more than 1,451 lives in the past month, according to newspaper reports. The government reports 630 deaths, but its figures are considered too low. At least 700,000 people from the countryside have taken refuge in <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>, a city of 6 million that is half inundated by the waters of the <LOCATION> Buriganga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. A few cases of diarrhea also were reported in <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>, where flood waters have seeped through leaking underground pipes into the drinking water supply. Health officials estimated that 40 million gallons of raw sewage are being pumped every day into the city's stagnant flood waters, where children play and though which adults wade to get relief food supplies. Diarrhea can kill by robbing the body of critically important substances such as sodium, potassium and magnesium. The fluid loss associated with diarrhea can lead to sudden collapse of the blood vessels, and loss of bicarbonates can turn the body's internal fluids to acid, disrupting normal metabolism. The government is trying to deliver food and medicine to millions of people stranded in remote areas of the country. Many others have been moved to temporary shelters after their houses were washed away. The waters of the Ganges and the <LOCATION> Brahmaputra </LOCATION> rivers, which flow from the Himalayas to the Bay of <LOCATION> Bengal </LOCATION>, remained at their highest levels in 34 years, though they did not rise Saturday, according to officials at <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>'s Flood Control Center. But they said the tributaries of the two rivers rose by a few inches Saturday. New floods have hit 12 of the country's 64 districts where river waters began to recede last week, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> airport reopened on Friday after being closed for six days because of water on the runway. President <PERSON> Hussain </PERSON> <PERSON> Muhammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON> said Saturday that the government was having difficulty delivering medicines and food to the victims. `` We have adequate food and other relief materials,'' the president told newspaper editors. `` But we do not have the means of reaching it to all the flood victims.'' The government has been supplying water purification tablets, but many people said they had not received any. The floods have submerged pumps and wells and there is little dry firewood to use for boiling contaminated water. In the Indian state of <LOCATION> Assam </LOCATION>, rains and flooding have left many people stranded, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported. State authorities have asked the federal government for $ 55 million for flood relief operations, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> said. Annual monsoon rains cause yearly floods in <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, whose 110 million people are among the world's poorest with an average income of $ 150 a year.

 With a few phrases under a hot East <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> sun, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> displayed the combative, aggressive stance that worried supporters have been beseeching him to display in his lagging campaign against Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. At the end of a week filled with calamities and plummeting polls, the Democratic presidential nominee took on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in his strongest language yet. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> compared <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s attacks, suggesting that he was short on patriotism and soft on crime, to McCarthyism of the 1950s, and said the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people could `` smell the garbage.'' `` He finally went ahead and said what we all feel,'' said <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON>, the blunt-spoken <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> state treasurer and Democratic convention keynoter. `` You can be statesmanlike only so long, when a schoolyard bully is pushing everybody around.'' Campaign aides want <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to keep up his tough talk about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> this week while he attempts to follow another piece of their advice _ to add more specifics to his rhetoric. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> plans to outline in greater detail his views on defense and national security during appearances this week, including one in <LOCATION> Annapolis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, where he had sought but failed to win the vice president's agreement for a foreign policy debate. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor kept up the attack Saturday, questioning the vice president's judgment in having three senior advisers who are partners in a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lobbying firm that once represented the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> government for an $ 800,000 fee. `` In a <ORGANIZATION> Dukakis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, there will be no back doors for foreign lobbyists,'' he said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> got an enthusiastic reception at a rally in <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, on Friday with his tough new response to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Campaign aides saw the speech as an important move toward lifting <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> out of his perceived slump. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> himself was visibly changed after the speech, shedding his reserved demeanor and draping his arm around a reporter. His campaign managers' discomfort over <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' slide in the polls since the Democratic convention in mid-July has been worsened by a frustrating campaign kickoff week in which events were disrupted or canceled, partly because of problems with chartered planes. Democrats voiced alarm at seeing <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> drop from a lead of 17 percentage points in post-convention polls to an eight-point deficit after Labor Day. Rep. <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, D-Mass., told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign had only two weeks to turn things around Democratic Sen. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Harkin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> said an overly cautious strategy of ignoring attacks by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> caused the decline. `` A president has to be an aggressive person,'' <PERSON> Harkin </PERSON> said. `` It's not the kind of world where you want a <PERSON> Caspar </PERSON> <PERSON> Milquetoast </PERSON> in the White House.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> privately urged <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to move swiftly to try to regain the offensive. `` I talked to him a lot, and I told him, ` you do n't have to take that kind of garbage','' she said. `` I think he had to respond.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has dominated the presidential campaign since his nomination in mid-August by carefully selecting and timing his easily understood attacks on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' record. The vice president seemed to be casting doubt on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' patriotism, while denying he was doing so, by making an issue of the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor's veto of a bill aimed at requiring public school teachers to lead their classes in reciting the Pledge of Allegiance <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he was advised that the bill was unconsititutional. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> press secretary <PERSON> Dayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> said the governor had written much of the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> speech himself. Campaign chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was angered by a pair of news stories during the week. In one, members of a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> booster organization were disclosed to have voiced anti-Semitic views. In the other, a lobbying firm associated with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign manager had received $ 800,000 for lobbying on behalf of a foreign official involved in a drug investigation. `` He read that and said, ` These people are questioning MY patriotism,'' <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> said. `` He was outraged,'' <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> said. The new conviction behind <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' assault on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> coincided with the return of his former campaign manager, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON>, who has a close relationship with the candidate and was warmly welcomed by other campaign staffers. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' formal campaign kickoff began on a dismal note. When he appeared in a <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> neighborhood early Labor Day morning, anti-abortion protesters clogged one end of the street and their chants reverberated down the block. A faulty sound system left <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' words unintelligible. Campaign sources said an advance man was fired. A day later in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' speech was disrupted by anti-abortion hecklers who determinedly tried to shout him down. Things got worse. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' campaign jet plane was effectively grounded by a <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> spot inspection which began 15 minutes before the scheduled takeoff. The rest of the day was lost. Press briefings were set up on the run, and contradictory answers were given to reporters. Arriving in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> for a welcome by <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaefer </PERSON>, the Democratic nominee found there was no ramp at the front of the plane. Nonetheless, <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> told reporters Friday morning that the week was `` tops'' for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. Later in the day, he repeated his declaration and added, `` Now I can say that with more conviction.''

 Fancied by <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON>, sold by <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and ignored by <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, the presidential yacht Sequoia is on the last leg of a 120-city fund-raising tour before it is returned to White House control. The Sequoia was bought by the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> from a <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> family in 1929. After <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON> wintered on the boat in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> in 1933, it was acquired by the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and declared the official presidential yacht. The 105-foot vessel served eight presidents over a period of 44 years before <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> ordered the ship sold at auction in 1977 as an austerity move. `` The Sequoia is really a symbol of the presidency in the 20th century,'' said <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> McGehee </PERSON>, spokesman for The <ORGANIZATION> Presidential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yacht </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION>, the private group that bought the ship and began restoring it in 1981. <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> planned war strategy from the ship, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> used it for the first international conference on nuclear arms control and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> held working sessions with the likes of Soviet leader <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> on board, <PERSON> McGehee </PERSON> said. The ship was open for public visits over the weekend at the <ORGANIZATION> Charlestown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yard </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. It will make more stops along the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> before it is donated to the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> on Nov. 15 and again becomes the presidential yacht. The fund-raising voyage has raised $ 5.5 million, half the $ 11 million needed for restoration costs and to create an endowment for future maintenance and operations without taxpayer expense, he said. But <PERSON> McGehee </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has failed to stamp his imprimatur on the project. `` This is the ultimate private sector project,'' he said. `` One would think <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would be willing to hold this up and say, ` This is what I've been talking about.''' <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> used the lure of an afternoon cruise on the ship to entangle legislators in marathon discussions and hold them hostage until they came around to his point of view, <PERSON> McGehee </PERSON> said. `` We've had some funny stories about senators and congressmen telling the captain to turn the boat around and go back to dock. The captain would say he could only listen to his commander-in-chief.'' <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> enjoyed taking cruises on the <LOCATION> Potomac </LOCATION> in the Sequoia and announced his decision to resign the presidency to his family aboard the ship. A joint congressional resolution in 1985 provided for the Sequoia's eventual return, and the ship was designated a National Historic Landmark earlier this year. <PERSON> McGehee </PERSON> said the Presidential Yacht Trust has spent $ 3.5 million restoring teak paneling, bleached ash interiors, handmade carpets, engines and other details. The ship was built for $ 210,000, but to build it now would cost between $ 8 million and $ 10 million.

<HEAD>Newspaper Says Investigation Shows Jetliner Hit By Missile</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Experts have concluded that an Italian jetliner which mysteriously crashed into a sea eight years ago, killing all 81 people on board, was shot down by missile, a newspaper reported. British and American experts have been analyzing the recently salvaged wreckage of the DC-9, which exploded and crashed into the <LOCATION> Tyrrhenian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> on June 27, 1980. The Italian government financed a salvage operation to raise the fuselage so experts could determine the cause of the disaster. The Milan newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Corriere </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> della </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sera </ORGANIZATION> said that British explosives experts and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> engineers at <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the jetliner's manufacturer, have determined the plane was downed by a missile. The paper said the missile exploded seconds before it would have struck the jetliner. It said the blast destroyed the cockpit, killed the flight crew, damaged the baggage compartment door on the right, scorched the outside of the plane and punched three grapefruit-size holes in the fuselage. The same newspaper reported in June that experts were certain the airliner had been hit by a missile. But a member of the investigating commission later denied it had reached any conclusions. <PERSON> Corriere </PERSON> <PERSON> della </PERSON> <PERSON> Sera </PERSON> said on Friday that the experts completed their investigation Thursday and that the results were being forwarded to Judge <PERSON> Vittorio </PERSON> <PERSON> Bucarelli </PERSON>, who is in charged of the inquiry. The newspaper said the voice recorder on the flight picked up an undecipherable shout just before the explosion. It also said the British experts are still trying to determine the chemical composition of the explosive as a way to trace the nationality of the missile. The plane was on a flight from <LOCATION> Bologna </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Palermo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sicily </LOCATION>. It crashed in the sea 30 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION>, between the islands of <LOCATION> Ponza </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ustica </LOCATION>.

 Thirty-four weary <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> firefighters have returned home to rest after `` scary ... but exciting'' work fighting forest fires in Yellowstone National Park. `` I want to go home, take a bath, clean up and see my family I had n't seen in 25 days,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Melton </PERSON>, 38, of <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION>, when they arrived Friday night. <PERSON> Sonja </PERSON> <PERSON> Durrwachter </PERSON>, 29, of <PERSON> Wiggins </PERSON> said she was looking forward to `` a hot bath and hugging my babies.'' `` We put in a lot of long hours,'' <PERSON> Durrwachter </PERSON> said. `` We got to see a lot of fire. We got a lot of experience on fires we do n't get around here. It was scary, but it was real exciting.'' Crew members averaged 15 hours per day, sometimes working as long as 19 hours, said crew boss <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>, 37, of <LOCATION> Starkville </LOCATION>. `` We defended structures around the canyons and the flames that hit us were 200 feet high.

The <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> crew was part of the team that tried to protect the Old Faithful geyser complex, he said, but the fire ran away from them and destroyed several buildings. Firefighters also had to contend with stubborn animals. `` The wildlife offered not only a challenge but a hazard to work around,'' <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> said, saying a buffalo would n't allow them to approach one area they wanted to hose down. `` We saw a lot of fresh bear signs. That was a constant concern.''

<HEAD>Labor Rejects Appeal To Call Off General Strike</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The nation's largest labor federation on Saturday rejected a government appeal to call off another general strike and said the work stoppage will be held to protest police repression. The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Confederation </ORGANIZATION> said its unions will hold a 24-hour nationwide strike on Monday. It had organized an 8-hour general strike Friday to protest the gpvernment's economic policies and police used tear gas, rubber bullets and clubs to disperse about 20,000 demonstrators at a rally in downtown <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION>. `` The Monday strike is unchangeable and there will be no modification,'' <PERSON> Saul </PERSON> <PERSON> Ubaldini </PERSON>, secretary-general of the labor federation, told reporters as he arrived at a union meeting to discuss Friday's violence. He said Monday's strike would be `` a peaceful repudiation'' of police actions Friday. Federal police said Saturday that 76 demonstrators and 37 policemen were injured during the disturbances in the Plaza de Mayo. They reported four civilians and eight policemen were hospitalized for fractures and cuts. Thirteen demonstrators were arrested and face charges of assault, resisting arrest, arson and vandalism, according to the report. The <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> had appealed to the labor federation to reconsider its call for a Monday strike. It said police intervened in the <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION> rally to halt vandalism and fighting between rival union groups. But <PERSON> Ubdaldini </PERSON> said, `` It's a lie that the incidents began among participants of the rally.'' Interior Minister <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Nosiglia </PERSON> issued a communique saying violence `` can only benefit small anti-democratic sectors.'' `` Nothing can justify a new paralyzation of the country that will only postpone progress without providing any benefit for rights and freedoms,'' it said. Monday's strike will be the 13th organized by the General Labor Confederation since the elected government of President <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> and his centrist <ORGANIZATION> Radical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> came to power Dec. 10, 1983, ending nearly eight years of military rule. The labor federation is dominated by the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Peronist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Both <PERSON> Nosiglia </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Pirker </PERSON> rejected union charges of police brutality and blamed agitators for the violence. <PERSON> Ubaldini </PERSON>, who fled the platform at the Plaza de Maya rally Friday in a cloud of tear gas, had described the strike as `` a peoples' referendum against the plan of hunger and misery that they -LRB- the government -RRB- want to impose on us.'' He referred to an anti-inflation plan introduced by the government last month that devalued the currency, lifted restrictions on some imports and called for voluntary wage and price controls. Inflation has registered 255 percent so far this this year and 440 percent during the past 12 months.

<HEAD>Discovery Of Mercury Could Threaten Plans For New Wildlife Refuge</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The discovery of mercury in freshwater marshes in eastern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> has complicated plans to turn the area into the <ORGANIZATION> Bayou </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sauvage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refuge </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> told city and state officials Thursday that they discovered quantities of mercury well above federal health levels near a landfill that has a history of leaking into the surrounding marshes. The city-owned Recovery I landfill is operated by <ORGANIZATION> Waste </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, and a company spokesman denied the landfill was the source of the mercury contamination. The Fish and Wildlife report said it found only mercury, not pesticides or petroleum hydrocarbons. The report said additional samples have been taken to confirm the mercury findings, and those results should be available in October. Officials said the mercury contamination poses no immediate health hazard. The marshland near the landfill is not used for commercial fishing or hunting, and since mercury is a heavy metal, it tends to sink and combine with sediment at the bottom of the marsh. Wildlife Service officials already were concerned that about 1,500 acres of marshland near the landfill was depleted of oxygen, a symptom of chemical and biological contaminants, and was not supporting wildlife. City officials had been negotiating with federal officials to see if an airport could be constructed near the proposed refuge. The questions raised by the <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> test results will slow down those negotiations, city officials said. City officials said they are n't convinced the landfill is the source of the contamination, and suggested the mercury might be from a spill from railroad tank cars on tracks that cut across the property. No such spill has been reported. Planning Commission Director <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Becker </PERSON> said city consultants also do n't understand why the test results turned up no other contaminants, when a mixture of contaminants would be more likely to escape from a landfill. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Quality </ORGANIZATION> officials said they will review the Recovery I operating permit, which expires Oct. 17. City officials have notified the state that they do n't plan to renew <ORGANIZATION> Waste </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>'s contract to operate the facility, although <ORGANIZATION> Waste </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> requested a 10-year extension of its state permit last year. The city wants to put operation of the landfill out to bid, and has asked the state for a seven-year grace period to continue to dispose household garbage in the landfill before shutting it down.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> lashed out anew at <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s judgment and leadership Saturday, accusing the vice president of associating with aides who helped the <LOCATION> Bahamian </LOCATION> government when it was under drug investigation and others reported to be sympathetic to <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> `` My staff will not have divided loyalties,'' the Democratic presidential nominee said. `` In a <ORGANIZATION> Dukakis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the staff will pledge allegiance to only one flag _ Old Glory.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, spending the weekend off the campaign trail, gave reporters copies of a memorandum from a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lobbying firm with which several top <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> advisers are associated. In the memo, the firm of <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manafort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> promised to improve the image of the government of the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> among <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration officials and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The Bahamian government accepted the proposal and paid the Republican lobbying firm $ 800,000 between April 1985 and September 1986. The Bahamian prime minister, <PERSON> Lynden </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON>, long has been suspected of involvement with drug traffickers. The lobbying firm's memo boasted of the company's influence within the administration and listed more than a dozen contacts with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s office. Three <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aides and advisers are partners in the firm. They are <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Manafort </PERSON> and <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. Stone. All have strong ties to the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> White House in addition to their campaign roles. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign manager <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> also is listed on the memo, but <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodin </PERSON> said <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> had no role in the contract. `` The measure of a president is the quality and the integrity of the people with whom he surrounds himself,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told a statehouse news conference. `` The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people have the right to know that the back door of the White House will not be the front door for paid agents of foreign governments. In a <ORGANIZATION> Dukakis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> there will be no back doors for foreign lobbyists.'' The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s association with the Black, <ORGANIZATION> Manafort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Stone </ORGANIZATION> partners and with campaign aides who have defended <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> organizations `` raises serious questions about Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s judgment and the kind of people he attracts.'' <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Brentar </PERSON>, co-chairman of The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'88 <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalities </ORGANIZATION>, was a defender of former <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> autoworker <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>, who was convicted in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> as a Nazi war criminal. <PERSON> Brentar </PERSON> resigned under fire. `` But <PERSON> Florian </PERSON> <PERSON> Galdau </PERSON> and <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Guarino </PERSON> -LRB- respectively honorary chairman and vice chairman of the panel -RRB- stay on -- despite revelations of their ties to fascist, pro-Nazi and anti-Semitic organizations,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, on Saturday, calling for the two to resign. The <ORGANIZATION> Philadephia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inquirer </ORGANIZATION> reported Saturday that several other <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign officials have supported Nazis. `` I think it says a great deal about that campaign,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` It says a great deal about the judgment of Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> used the `` pledge allegiance to only one flag'' line to counter <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s attacks on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for his 1977 veto of a bill aimed at requiring state public school teachers to lead pupils in reciting the Pledge of Allegiance. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had been advised the bill was unconstitutional. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rejected a <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> proposal Friday that each day's session in that chamber begin not only with a prayer but with the <ORGANIZATION> Pledge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Allegiance </ORGANIZATION>, but Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said the pledge would be recited on two mornings next week <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he had no objection if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> decided to start each legislative day with the pledge. He then quickly cited <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s official duty as president of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, and said: `` To the best of my knowledge he's never once suggested that the pledge be part of the regular routine of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> So who's kidding whom? On Friday, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> likened the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> attacks on him to McCarthyism of the 1950s. He stopped short of directly accusing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of such tactics Saturday, but criticized him for not condemning several unsubstantiated attacks on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, his wife and <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nominee <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. `` Remaining silent, in my judgment, is not the way you take responsibility and provide leadership,'' the governor said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> planned to meet Saturday night and Sunday with several <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> who are experts in national security and defense matters, including Sens. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and Rep. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. Those sessions were to help prepare <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to outline his positions in detail next week on those issues. Republicans have labeled <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> weak and naive in those areas. `` I happen to think Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is very vulnerable on foreign policy and national security issues,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said Saturday. `` It's a question of judgment, questions of support for Iran-Contra, Latin-American policy which is failed and illegal, statements made, failure of execution, a whole series of task forces which the vice president has been in charge of which have been absolute failures,'' he said. `` I think it's time now that the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people take a good, hard look at his record.''

 Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and running mate <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> turned up the heat Saturday in a get-tough campaign against Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who buoyantly prepared for a cross-country tour of industrial states rich in electoral votes. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, spending the weekend in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, accused several of the vice president's closest aides of using the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> as a `` back door for foreign lobbyists'' and declared that `` in a Dukakis White House, the staff will pledge allegiance to only one flag _ Old Glory.'' Preceding <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> inspected evidence of gang violence _ guns, knives and a bullet-riddled car _ which he said had increased during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had led the war against drugs as vice president and `` blew it badly.'' The <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nominee, elated by an eight-point lead over <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in public opinion polls, relaxed at his <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> home this weekend before leaving Monday for appearances in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also planned to announce the formation of a national security advisory task force including former Secretary of State <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON>, former <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> ambassador <PERSON> Jeane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkpatrick </PERSON>, former national security adviser <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> and <PERSON> Zbigniew </PERSON> <PERSON> Brzezinski </PERSON>, who was President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s national security adviser. `` I mean to win this election,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said repeatedly last week. And <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> finally heeded his worried supporters' pleas to take a more combative, aggressive stance against <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The Democratic nominee stepped up the attack at a news conference Saturday in which he denounced the vice president for employing three senior advisers who also are partners in a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lobbying firm hired by the government of the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> to improve its image among <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration officials. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> released a memo by the firm of <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Manafort </PERSON> and <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. Stone which boasted of the company's influence inside the administration and listed more than a dozen contacts in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s office The firm received $ 800,000 in 1985 and 1986 from the Bahamian government. The Bahamian prime minister, <PERSON> Lynden </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON>, long as been suspected of involvement with drug traffickers. `` The measure of a president is the quality and the integrity of the people with whom he surrounds himself,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people have the right to know that the back door of the White House will not be the front door for paid agents of foreign governments. In a <ORGANIZATION> Dukakis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, there will be no back doors for foreign lobbyists.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> referred to other campaign aides who reportedly have been sympathetic to Nazis and <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> organizations, including <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Brentar </PERSON>, who resigned as co-chairman of a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign organization for ethnic groups when it was disclosed that he once defended convicted Nazi war criminal <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>. `` I think it says a great deal about that campaign,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` It says a great deal about the judgment of Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' `` The moral clock is ticking on the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, on Saturday, calling for the resignations of <PERSON> Florian </PERSON> <PERSON> Galdau </PERSON> and <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Guarino </PERSON>, two members of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s Coaliton of American Nationalities who he said had `` ties to fascist, pro-Nazi and anti-Semitic organizations. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also twitted <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, as president of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, for never proposing that senators recite the Pledge of Allegiance as part of their legislative business. That comment, and his reference to pledging allegiance to only one flag, was the nominee's response to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s frequent criticism of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for vetoing a state bill aimed at requiring public school teachers to lead their classes in reciting the pledge. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> says he was advised that the bill was unconstitutional. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> toured the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff's `` Operation Safe Streets'' program in the <LOCATION> Carson </LOCATION> area, a major site of violent gang activities, and took the occasion to blast <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s role in the administration's anti-drug campaign. `` The ultimate irony of the Reagan-Bush popgun war on drugs is the role of the vice president,'' the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator said. `` They asked him to lead the battle, and he blew it badly.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` talks tough on crugs, but while he has been talking, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has lost control of our borders. ... The unprecedented influx of drugs has turned <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s youth gangs into heavily armed, well-organized, deadly criminal cartels.'' He added: `` The fact is this administration has botched the war on drugs. They're trying to fight that battle with eight Cabinet officers, 26 federal agencies, but only one general _ and his name is <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>.'' Panamanian leader <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has been indicted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for drug trafficking. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> counterpart, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, relaxed at his home in the Virginian suburbs of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, with plans to attend his son's soccer game He departs Monday on a campaign swing through <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Trying to lay to rest another controversy from his past, the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator told reporters Friday that `` I got into law school fair and square. Nothing improper was done and no rules were broken.'' He was responding to questions about a report in The -LRB- <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> -RRB- Plain Dealer indicating that he entered <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> under a program intended primarily to benefit minority students. The <ORGANIZATION> Reagan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> did its part to boost <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s candidacy on Saturday. In his weekly radio speech, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said the nation's schools are improving because for the past eight years, he and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` have been there with a sympathetic ear and a helping hand. The boast immediately drew a denial from <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democratic Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>. White House press spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, in a television interview on `` <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON>'s One on One,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was `` a very strong leader'' and a personable friend.

^Bentsen Says Bush Headed `Popgun War' Against Drugs</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Democratic vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said Saturday that illegal narcotics flooded the nation while Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> directed a botched `` popgun war'' against drugs. `` The vice president talks tough on drugs, but while he has been talking, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has lost control of our borders,'' the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator said at an outdoor rally attended by several hundred supporters. `` The ultimate irony of the Reagan-Bush popgun war on drugs is the role of the vice president,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. `` They asked him to lead the battle, and he blew it.'' He said that after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was named head of the drug interdiction task force in 1983, `` he did so badly that the head of the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> called for abolishment'' of the program. `` On <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s watch, the international production of drugs, the flow of drugs into this country and the use of drugs all increased dramatically,'' he said. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> criticized plans by <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to have his vice presidential running mate, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, head a new anti-drug effort. In a recent newspaper interview, a reporter had to inform <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had directed the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's efforts. `` Now he wants to pass the torch of incompetence on to the junior senator from <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> who is so disinterested that he did n't even know that his running mate had been head,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said `` The fact is, this administration has botched the war on drugs,'' he said. `` They're trying to fight that battle with eight Cabinet officers, 26 federal agencies, but only one general _ and his name is <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>,'' referring to <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> who is under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> indictment for alleged drug trafficking. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> promised that a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> administration would name one person to head the drug eradication effort and `` wo n't coddle drug dictators like <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>.'' He needled the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campain for its ties to lobbyists. `` Some of the top lieutenants of the vice president have been accepting hundreds of thousand of dollars as paid agents of foreign governments ... under investigation today for drug trafficking,'' he said. `` We'll cut off foreign aid to governments that refuse to cooperate with us in the war on drugs,'' said <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, pledging increased support for federal anti-drug agencies and more coordination with local law enforcement officials. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has `` tried to slash funds to assist state and local governments in their drug enforcement efforts,'' he said. `` The unprecedented influx of drugs has turned <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s youth gangs into heavily armed, well organized, deadly criminal cartels,'' said <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, who earlier visited a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> area plagued by gang warfare Accompanied by Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif., <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> viewed knives, guns and a bullet-ridden car as he toured the <LOCATION> Carson </LOCATION> area where the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's office is running an Operation Safe Streets program Just hours earlier, four people standing in a crowd were shot from a passing car in what the sheriff's office said was a gang incident. `` When we talk about waging this war, we have a lot more to do,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said before he was shown military-type assault weapons, sawed-off shotguns and the other weapons confiscated in the area. As for gun control laws, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said, `` I think a waiting period for the purchase of handguns is a reasonable limitation.'' He added that he preferred this be done at a state's option, indicating he might oppose pending legislation that would impose a national waiting period. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was making his third trip to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> since receiving the vice presidential nomination in July. He and Democratic presidential candidate <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> are planning several return trips in a bid for the state's 47 electoral votes, the most of any state. sk

 <PERSON> Commodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazard </PERSON> <PERSON> Perry </PERSON>'s brigantine <LOCATION> Niagara </LOCATION> returned to the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> on Saturday, exactly 175 years after his fleet defeated the British in the Battle of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION>. `` We are starting a new page in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>'s history, and you all are a part of it,'' Gov. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> told an estimated 5,000 people gathered for the launching ceremony. <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON>, lifted a bottle of <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> wine and struck the 182-foot, 278-ton restored ship, bedecked with the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flag and <PERSON> Perry </PERSON>'s battle flag, `` Do n't Give Up the Ship.'' The bottle did n't break, however, and she had to strike the ship again, this time successfully. Shortly afterward, a crane lifted the ship into <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Presque </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Isle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> Eighteen cannons fired a military salute, and more than 200 private boats anchored in the bay to watch the festivities blared their horns. It was the fourth time the ship had been restored, this time using $ 3.8 million in state and private funds. The restored <LOCATION> Niagara </LOCATION> will be outfitted by next spring with 118-foot and 113-foot masts, square rigging, about 22,000 square feet of polyester sail and 20 aluminum cannon. It will then tour the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> ports as <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>'s `` official flagship.'' The first USS Niagara was one of six small ships built in this port city during the War of 1812 and put under <PERSON> Perry </PERSON>'s command to break a British blockade of American Great Lakes ports and to defend the <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Territory </LOCATION>. On Sept. 10, 1813, <PERSON> Perry </PERSON>'s nine-ship squadron met six British vessels under Commodore <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Heriot </PERSON> <PERSON> Barclay </PERSON> in a short but fierce battle near <LOCATION> Put-in-Bay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Perry </PERSON>'s flagship, the USS Lawrence, was disabled by British fire. <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> transferred to the <LOCATION> Niagara </LOCATION>, where he hoisted his famous battle flag, `` Do n't Give up the Ship,'' and attacked again. The Niagara helped break the British battle line and forced <PERSON> Barclay </PERSON> to surrender. `` We have met the enemy and they are ours: two ships, two brigs, one schooner and one sloop,'' <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> reported to his superiors. The <LOCATION> Niagara </LOCATION> served as a station ship in <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION> until 1820, when it was scuttled in nearby Misery Bay. The ship was raised by <PERSON> Erie </PERSON> citizens in 1913 and restored for a Great Lakes tour to celebrate the 100th anniversary of <PERSON> Perry </PERSON>'s victory. The ship was restored again in the 1930s and 1940s. In the latest restoration, <PERSON> Melbourne </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Annapolis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, marine architect, dismantled the <LOCATION> Niagara </LOCATION> and rebuilt it to historical specifications. Forty-two pieces of the original ship are incorporated in the restored brigantine.

<HEAD>Dwarf Loves Being Tossed Around, Ignores Criticism From Other
Little People</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> loves getting thrown around in dwarf-tossing contests, and shrugs off bitter criticisms of the practice by associations for little people. `` I think it's a lot of fun,'' said the 4-foot-5 human projectile. `` If <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> can make fun of being black, if <PERSON> Dom </PERSON> <PERSON> DeLuise </PERSON> can make fun of being fat, why not me? Why ca n't I make fun of being short? `` I'm into it. I'm an entertainer.'' He also works as a welder and circus entertainer. `` I eat fire, eat nails, walk on broken glass,'' he said. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, 27, is next slated for a show Sept. 13-15 at a downtown bar, <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, with a $ 1,000 prize for the winner. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, who'll be wearing a crash helmet, knee pads and a harness for contestants to grab, says he'll be rooting for participants to outdistance the 7-feet, 8-inch distance he was tossed in a <LOCATION> Bradenton </LOCATION> bar last summer. Dwarfism groups hate the idea. `` From the standpoint of little people, it's demeaning,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Etten </PERSON>, former president of <ORGANIZATION> Little </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, which represents about 4,000 dwarfs. `` It's mean-spirited. It moves us back to the Dark Ages. It's poking fun at a minority group,'' said <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Etten </PERSON>, noting that public outcry helped kill plans for a dwarf-throwing contest in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> in 1985 <ORGANIZATION> Manatee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commissioners </ORGANIZATION> did n't like the <LOCATION> Bradenton </LOCATION> dwarf toss, but could n't find a law under which they could ban it. `` I think we all pretty much felt like it was low-level type of entertainment,'' said commission Chairman <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Chetlain </PERSON>. `` It's like somebody capitalizing on someone's disfigurement or infirmity. <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> publicist <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> brushed off such contentions, saying the contest is fun, attracts customers and is certain to generate publicity for the bar. And <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said he makes good money being tossed. Dwarf-tossing began as a bar stunt in <LOCATION> Queensland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Etten </PERSON>'s wife <PERSON> Angela </PERSON>, author of `` Dwarfs Do n't Live in Doll Houses.'' `` It is actually freak show entertainment, the sort of thing you saw in the 1930s,'' she said. `` The problem with freak show entertainment is it sets the dwarf apart as something to be stared out and made fun of, which makes it difficult for the rest of us, who are n't participating, to be treated as equal.''

 <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and other Solidarity leaders Saturday demanded an end to government reprisals against workers who went on strike and said authorities should be prepared to consider legalizing the labor group. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, key Solidary advisers and other activists gathered in a <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> to plan their strategy for talks with authorities on the future of the outlawed labor movement. They issued a statement late Saturday saying they wanted confirmation that authorities are prepared to `` create conditions'' for legalizing Solidarity, which was suspended in 1981 and subsequently outlawed. The weekend conference is one of the largest gatherings of the Polish opposition in years. The meeting Saturday included Solidarity regional leaders and strike committee members, and a gathering Sunday is to include intellectuals and cultural figures who advise Solidarity founder <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>. The group is meeting to discuss the communist government's offer to enter negotiations. On Aug. 31, authorities agreed to open talks and <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> agreed to end a 19-day wave of strikes. <PERSON> Andrzej </PERSON> <PERSON> Stelmachowski </PERSON>, a Roman Catholic intellectual acting as a mediator between the governent and opposition, said he expected the gpvermment-Solidarity talks would begin in the middle of the week. Diplomatic sources said they were told the meeting would begin Sept. 15. At the end of Saturday's meeting the Solidarity leadership released a statement saying: `` We expect a clear expression by the Polish authorities of readiness to create conditions for legal functioning of Solidarity. `` Only the legalization of Solidarity allows the effective participation of the union in reforming the country.'' The statement also demanded an end to reprisals against workers who had participated in strikes. Actions such as detentions, firings and induction of strike participants into the military `` impair the credibility of the authorities' proposals,'' it said. `` We expect an immediate end to repressions.'' Union activists have reported about 350 miners were fired following strikes in the coal region of southern poland and dozens of other workers received army draft notices. Solidarity sources, speaking with the condition of anonymity, said the statement should not be considered an ultimatum and the round-table talks could begin even without official gestures. <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>, an adviser to <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, said Solidarity wanted a signal from authorities that the talks could be held `` in serious conditions with a chance for success.'' <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> said <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and representatives of four regional strike committees would represent Solidarity at the talks with the government. Saturday's meeting was held at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brygida </ORGANIZATION>'s church near the Lenin shipyard where Solidarity was born in 1980 amid nationwide strikes and became the first free trade union in the Soviet bloc. Attending the meeting were the 15-member national executive commission of Solidarity, representatives of strike committees during the Aug. 16-Sept. 3 wave of strikes and members of the interfactory strike committees Among the 40 participants were solidarity advisers such as <PERSON> Jacek </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuron </PERSON>, <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Michnik </PERSON> and <PERSON> Zbigniew </PERSON> <PERSON> Romaszewski </PERSON> who monitor human rights abuses. Nearby in another church, leaders of the banned <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Students </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> met and drafted a statement in support of Solidarity. `` I'm surprised by the way these people are prepared,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said during a break in the session. `` There are a lot of fighting people who I expected to represent their fighting manner. And I am surprised by their great feeling of responsibility and great wisdom, especially among the young people.'' Solidarity is seeking to win back the legal status it lost following Polish leader Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>'s Dec. 13, 1981, martial-law crackdown. Government spokesman <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Urban </PERSON> and Politburo member <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Miodowicz </PERSON>, leader of the officially sanctioned trade union OPZZ, last week reiterated the official stand that Solidarity can not be legalized again as a trade federation. But Urban also said officials were entering the talks with no preconditions. Opposition spokesmen said they insist on the legalization of the union, and they want the issue settled before they will engage in talks on the broad range of political and economic problems. The talks to discuss workers' grievances were proposed by Interior Minister Gen. <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> during the August strikes, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s worst wave of labor unrest since 1981. When <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> and <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> met Aug. 31 they agreed that the talks could include discussing the future of Solidarity. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> then appealed to his supporters for a speedy end to the remaining strikes so the talks could convene. Col. <PERSON> Stanislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kwiatkowski </PERSON>, the chief government pollster, said the authorities have no one to blame but themselves for being forced back into talks with <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and Solidarity. `` Briefly stated, it is the sluggishness of the party and the government which are to blame for the rebirth of Solidarity, whose cadres have begun to count again in the political game,'' <PERSON> Kwiatkowski </PERSON> said in the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> Zycie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warszawy </ORGANIZATION>.

 Two former guerrillas of an underground Jewish group once led by Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said they helped assassinate a Swedish <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> envoy to <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> 40 years ago, according to a television program. It was the first time that members of the <ORGANIZATION> Stern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> acknowledged they were involved in the killing of Count <PERSON> Folke </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernadotte </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s state-run <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> said. The militant group, also known as <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fighters </ORGANIZATION>, was initially headed by <PERSON> Avraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>. It was a splinter faction of the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. The faction, which carried out terrorist acts to undermine British rule in mandatory Palestine, opposed <PERSON> Bernadotte </PERSON>'s proposals that the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> be given control over <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and key areas be returned to Arab jurisdiction. In 1942, after British police fatally shot <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>, the group was led by <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, <PERSON> Natan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yellin-Mor </PERSON> and <PERSON> Yisrael </PERSON> <PERSON> Scheib-Eldad </PERSON>, the group's ideologist. In interviews for <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> aired Friday, two former members of the group said that Yellin-Mor and Scheib-Eldad approved the assassination. The organization officially disbanded about four months before the killing, and <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> had no connection with the assassination, said his spokesman <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahimeir </PERSON>. Although members of the group may have been involved, <PERSON> Ahimeir </PERSON> said, `` There was no organization at the time, and <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> was not a commander.'' Asked about <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s response to the TV report, <PERSON> Ahimeir </PERSON> said the prime minister `` is dealing with the issues of present and future and not with the distant past.'' The issue was not expected to have any effect on upcoming elections. Israelis have believed for years that the <ORGANIZATION> Stern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> was behind the killing. Journalist <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Margalit </PERSON> interviewed <PERSON> Yehoshua </PERSON> <PERSON> Zetler </PERSON> and <PERSON> Meshulam </PERSON> <PERSON> Makover </PERSON>, who he said were the mastermind and the driver in <PERSON> Bernadotte </PERSON>'s killing. <PERSON> Margalit </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Zetler </PERSON> as saying he decided to kill <PERSON> Bernadotte </PERSON>, president of the Swedish <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> during and after World War II, after the envoy proposed the formation of a union of an Arab and a Jewish state. <PERSON> Bernadotte </PERSON> was appointed in May 1948 to negotiate a cease-fire and recommend a settlement in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 1948 War of Independence. `` <PERSON> Zetler </PERSON> said he conferred with <PERSON> Eldad </PERSON>, and the two traveled to <LOCATION> Haifa </LOCATION> to discuss it with Yellin-Mor. Yellin-Mor demanded that after the killing, the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fighters </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- deny its role and blame the slaying on a tiny group of zealots called <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Homeland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Margalit </PERSON> said. Scheib-Eldad, now an elderly philosophy lecturer living in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, said in a telephone interview he could not comment because <PERSON> Zetler </PERSON> and <PERSON> Makover </PERSON> `` were talking about the operational side, and I was the ideologist. I have no way of knowing if their account is correct.'' The television program quoted <PERSON> Makover </PERSON> as saying the guerrillas arrived in two cars to the spot selected by <PERSON> Zetler </PERSON> for the Sept. 17, 1948, killing in downtown <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. When the three-car <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> convoy approached the narrow street, the jeep blocked its way and three guerrillas jumped outside, with Makover staying behind the wheel, it said. <PERSON> Makover </PERSON> was quoted as saying guerrilla <PERSON> Yehoshua </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> fired the shots that killed <PERSON> Bernadotte </PERSON>. The assassination was widely blamed on the <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fighters </ORGANIZATION>, and the Israeli government launched a nationwide hunt for its members. About 400 people, including Yellin-Mor were arrested, but the killers were never found. <PERSON> Scheib-Eldad </PERSON> said most of those detained were released, but some faced trial for membership in an illegal organization. The organization was disbanded in May 1948 and most of the members joined the Israeli army, but it preserved a separate status in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> until it was outlawed after <PERSON> Bernadotte </PERSON>'s assassination in September. Yellin-Mor and <PERSON> Matitiyahu </PERSON> <PERSON> Shmulevitch </PERSON>, also a group member, were sentenced to short jail terms and pardoned when the first Knesset, or <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, convened in 1949, <PERSON> Scheib-Eldad </PERSON> said.

 An oil well blazed away Saturday as firefighters slowly drained thousands of gallons of oil from 11 storage tanks before attempting to extinguish the fire and cap the well, authorities said. One man was burned and $ 5 million worth of drilling equipment was destroyed when the well ignited Thursday at a <ORGANIZATION> Seneca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> oil field in <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Padres </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>. The blaze apparently began when a spark from an electric fan ignited fumes, officials said.

 The foreign ministers of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> met Saturday for their first face-to-face peace talks in more than two weeks. But talks were halted after less than four hours, suggesting an impasse over <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s refusal to move the negotiations to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s support of a recess and change of location. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials said the negotiations would resume on Sunday. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Tariq </PERSON> <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> led the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> delegation to the meeting at the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. The Iranians, headed by Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON>, came less than five minutes later. As at their previous full meetings in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, the two delegations sat down at separate tables about 30 feet apart in the Council Chamber of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> building. The mediator, <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Eliasson </PERSON>, was seated at his own table at the head of the triangular arrangement. Saturday's session was the first direct session at ministerial level since the second day of talks Aug. 26. Earlier, an <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> official was quoted as saying <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> refused to suspend negotiations and move them to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sadoon </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, was quoted in a newspaper interview as spelling out his side's position, which clashes with <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s willingness to consider a break and shift of venue `` There is no justification to move the negotiations to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, because <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General agreed on <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> as the place for these negotiations,'' <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> said in an interview published Saturday in the <LOCATION> Abu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dhabi </LOCATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> Al-Ittihad </ORGANIZATION>. He said the talks are passing through a difficult stage and accused <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> of trying to scuttle them from the start. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> had no immediate official word on whether the latest conflict has been resolved. Among <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s priorities at the talks are a withdrawal of troops to internationally recognized boundaries, exchange of war prisoners and a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> investigation to determine who started the war. A long-standing dispute concerns a 1975 treaty setting the Iran-Iraq boundary down the middle of the Shatt-al-Arab waterway. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has renounced the pact and claimed the entire waterway, but <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> says it still considers the treaty valid. The waterway has been blocked by sunken ships and silt nearly since the start of the war in September 1980. In <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, the foreign ministers' conference of the 101-nation non-aligned movement called on <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> to cooperate in good faith with the secretary-general for full implementation of the U.N.-sponsored cease-fire. Earlier, Iranian deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lavasani </PERSON> charged <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> was preventing progress in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> by raising `` extraneous issues'' in the talks. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s deputy foreign minister, <PERSON> Wissam </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Zahawi </PERSON>, told a plenary session <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> was `` trying to create a crisis in the negotiations.''

 The chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> hurled a symbolic pitch Saturday to mark the delivery of a shipment of baseball equipment to Nicaraguans at a refugee camp in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the exchange chairman, said another shipment will be delivered to the refugees later and a third will be given to Hondurans. Baseball has been a popular Nicaraguan sport since the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military intervention in the 1920s. Hundreds of refugees looked wide-eyed at the bats, balls and gloves donated by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> major league baseball teams and sporting goods manufacturers. `` This makes me happy,'' said <PERSON> Sabel </PERSON> <PERSON> Correa </PERSON>, 28, who fled <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> six years ago and at one time was a rebel fighting the Sandinista government. `` Baseball is important to Nicaraguans.'' <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON>, who said he left <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> two years ago to escape being drafted into the army, agreed. He said the camp at <LOCATION> Jacaleapa </LOCATION> has four adult basebll teams and two junior leagues. `` There's not much else to do,'' he said. The 517 helmets, 2,400 gloves, 1,600 bats, 800 caps, 700 balls and 500 T-shirts delivered Saturday by a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military transport plane will be shared among 13,000 Nicaraguans in three U.N.-run refugee camps in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON>, who is co-chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commisson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recovery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, said the idea for providing baseball equipment emerged in 1987 when he visited the <LOCATION> Jacaleapa </LOCATION> camp 60 miles east of the capital of <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION>. `` As you can see, there are vast numbers of children here with nothing to do,'' he said, standing amid the rows of wooden shacks that house more than 6,000 people. He said he approached Baseball Commissioner <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> about providing equipment and `` the response was great.'' <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON> walked among crowds of children in tattered clothes, many of them too young to remember their homeland. Their families fled <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> shortly after the left-wing <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> ousted the government of President <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON> in July 1979. Many other refugees here crossed the border because of the 6-year-old war between the U.S.-backed rebels known as Contras and the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Grenado </PERSON>, 12, said his family left <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> in 1981. He said his father and a brother were both Contra and were killed fighting the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>. A sister and another brother are still with the Contras, he said. `` I really learn baseball,'' he said quietly, adjusting his baseball hat. Scores of youths took part in a training session led by <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Avila </PERSON>, a Cuban-born scout for the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dodgers </ORGANIZATION>. `` I tell them I never saw a city until I was 14 and three years later I was playing major league ball,'' <PERSON> Avila </PERSON> said.

 The army imposed a curfew Saturday in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>'s largest city after a Palestinian was fatally stabbed and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops wounded 14 Arabs in a series of clashes, the military and hospital officials said. Residents in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> said the stabbing victim, 35-year-old <PERSON> Athad </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghosh </PERSON>, may have been killed by fellow Arabs for allegedly collaborating with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities. His death early Saturday brought to 262 the number of Palestinians killed since the uprising began Dec. 8 in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> seized from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. Five Israelis also have been slain. In <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, one Palestinian was killed and three were wounded Saturday when a bomb was thrown at their car, the army said. It reported the attack involved a feud between families and was not linked to the anti-Israeli uprising. <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports identified the slain man as <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ayad </PERSON>, 20, and said reasons for the attack were unclear. Hospital officials said <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops firing regular bullets wounded four Palestinians in clashes in and around <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> and at least 10 other Arabs were injured by rubber bullets and beatings. They said a 12-year-old boy was struck in the eye by a rubber bullet and was in critical condition. Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> vowed to crush the uprising in a New Year's message to soldiers Saturday. The Jewish New Year, or <LOCATION> Rosh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hashana </LOCATION>, starts Sunday afternoon. `` We shall repel this wave of violence,'' <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said. `` We shall act to calm down the -LRB- occupied -RRB- territories and allow peace talks to take place.'' An army official confirmed the stabbing death of <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghosh </PERSON> and indicated it was one of the reasons for the indefinite curfew on <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>'s biggest city. `` But the army has several reasons for imposing the curfew,'' he said, speaking on condition of anonymity. He declined to elaborate. Parts of the city, where 125,000 Palestinians live, were under curfew while other areas were declared closed military zones, he said. Curfews keep people off the streets, and declaration of a military zone prevents movement in and out of a particular neighborhood. The army said it also imposed a curfew on the nearby refugee camp of <LOCATION> Balata </LOCATION>, home to some 12,000 Palestinians. An official at <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>' <LOCATION> Ittihad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> said the facility treated four Palestinians age 16 to 20 who were shot and wounded Saturday in clashes with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> and the nearby village of <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION>. A 20-year-old wounded in the abdomen was in serious condition, while the others were wounded in the stomach, face and leg, respectively, he said. The <LOCATION> Ittihad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said town residents were afraid that in imposing the curfew `` the army is going to do the same thing as they did in <LOCATION> Qalqilya </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> Qalqilya </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of 25,000, has been under curfew for five days as soldiers conduct house-to-house searches and make arrests. At least 200 suspected <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> activists have been detained in the largest military operation since the start of the Arab uprising. A similar raid was conducted Friday in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Kfar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Malik </LOCATION>. The army surrounded the village at dawn and arrested 25 Palestinians suspected of anti-Israeli activities, Arab witnesses said. On Saturday, villagers in <PERSON> Kfar </PERSON> <PERSON> Malik </PERSON> raised a dozen outlawed <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flags and painted new anti-Israeli slogans on the walls to replace those whitewashed during the army raid, said an Arab reporter who visited the village. In southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops captured four guerrillas after seriously wounding one of them in a brief firefight Saturday, the Israeli military command said. There were no Israeli casualites, the army said. It said an Israeli army patrol spotted the four guerrillas in the central sector of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s self-proclaimed `` security zone'' in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and attacked the squad. <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> said the guerrillas were apparently on their way to carry out an attack in the security zone, a six-to-10 mile wide buffer area along the border.

 Up to 60,000 gallons of crude oil from a burst underground oil line gushed down a busy suburban street into sewers and the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> Saturday, officials said. The break in the <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> pipe closed <LOCATION> Ventura </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boulevard </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Encino </LOCATION> area and exits from the Ventura Freeway.

An operator at <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION>'s Torrance plant shut down the pipe four minutes after a drop in pressure was noticed, he said. Automatic controls would have shut down the pipe a few minutes later, he added. The leak in the pipe, which spans 180 miles from <LOCATION> Bellridge </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Torrance </LOCATION>, will have no significant effect on the company's operations, he said <PERSON> Carbonetti </PERSON> said the company sent representatives through the affected neighborhood to take damage claims from residents and businesses. Six barriers were placed in the river to prevent crude oil from reaching the ocean, he said. Officials did not know how much oil seeped into the river through sewers, <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON> said. A police hazardous materials team notified county health officials but determined the spill posed no danger and did not require evacuations, <PERSON> Guarino </PERSON> said. Reserve and traffic officers spent the day diverting traffic.

 Civil rights activists who worked together in the 1960s were honored at a reunion Saturday for a struggle that one said is `` not for one day, or one week, or one year, but for a lifetime.'' Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, D-Ga., former chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Student </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nonviolent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coordinating </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, received an honorary doctorate at a convocation opening <ORGANIZATION> Williams </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>'s 196th academic year, along with <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Parks </PERSON>, whose refusal to surrender her seat to a white passenger on a <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, bus sparked the modern civil rights movement Parks received a standing ovation from the audience of 1,000 students, faculty members and administrators.

<HEAD>Leftist Parties Hold First Mass Rally Since 1973 Coup</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Thousands of people jammed a broad avenue Saturday for the first mass rally organized by leftist groups since a bloody coup ousted them from power 15 years ago. `` This is clear proof that the Chilean left is alive,'' <PERSON> Hernan </PERSON> <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Canto </PERSON>, who had served as an Interior Minister under Marxist President <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Allende </PERSON>, told rally participants. The rally was held on the eve of the anniversary of the Sept. 11, 1973, military coup that crushed the Allende's elected government. <PERSON> Allende </PERSON> perished during the fighting at the Presidential Palace. Organizers said about 80,000 people attended the festive and peaceful rally along a broad avenue in a working-class district of the capital. Reporters estimated the crowd at around 40,000. The rally was called by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Left </ORGANIZATION>, a seven-party coalition that includes the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Red communist flags clearly ounumbered the banners of other parties waved by people in the enthusiastic crowd. As a police helicopter hovered overhead the people booed and chanted, `` Murderers! Murderers!'' Police did not intervene and remained several blocks away. Among those at the rally were several people who, like <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Canto </PERSON>, had been ranking officials in the Allende administration. They returned to <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> after President <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> issued a decree 10 days ago abolishing the policy of political exile. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, 72, is the army commander and led the coup against <PERSON> Allende </PERSON>. His military government has ruled since the coup and he is seeking to remain in office for eight more years through a presidential referendum set for next month. Speakers called for unity to defeat <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> in the referendum scheduled for Oct. 5. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> was picked by himself and the commanders of the air force, navy and national police as the only candidate in the referendum in which the voters will accept or reject him. `` Without us, victory will not be possible in the referendum,'' said <PERSON> Anibal </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON>, a socialist and president of the coalition. `` Without us, it will not be possible to put an end to the dictatorship and recover democracy.'' More than 100,000 people joined in an opposition rally in <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> on Monday, but that was dominated by centrist parties and Saturday's gathering was the first to be held only by the leftists since military rule began. Police battled demonstrators at Monday's rally and three people were killed, 21 injured and more than 1,000 detained. On Saturday, speakers repeatedly called on the crowd to disband peacefully, `` avoiding violence, disturbances and provocations.''

 `` The Last Emperor'' officially premiered in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Saturday with little fanfare and less than a full house, drawing few luminaries and only scattered applause. Originally set for Sept. 27, the official premiere of the acclaimed film about the life of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s last emperor, <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Pu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yi </PERSON>, was moved up at the last minute. Associate producer <PERSON> Franco </PERSON> <PERSON> Giovale </PERSON>, who is in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> working on another movie, was the only representative from the West who attended. He said he was informed of the Saturday afternoon screening only three days in advance. Director <PERSON> Bernardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bertolucci </PERSON> was in his hometown of <ORGANIZATION> Parma </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, and unable to make the trip on short notice, <PERSON> Giovale </PERSON> said. Also missing was <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s Vice Minister of Culture <PERSON> Ying </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruochen </PERSON>, an actor who played the prison warden, and leading members of the government and culturual circles. The official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said the premiere was moved up at the request of Chinese cinema managers anxious to show the Italian-Chinese co-production that has won international acclaim. Selected theaters in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> have had special screenings that have drawn large crowds of Chinese eager to see why the film won nine Oscars and to compare it with a Chinese TV series of the same name. However, the audience at the premier filled only three-quarters of the cinema in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s Nationalities Palace, and one woman said she came only because a friend had given her the free ticket. Although the audience reacted with laughter at the antics of the baby emperor and cheered during the scenes of zealous Red Guards marching through the streets during the Cultural Revolution, there was only brief and scattered applause when the credits rolled. Some have criticized the movie, which was shot in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, as being inaccurate, and others say it represents a foreigner's view of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` It's likely that some Chinese audiences will be unhappy with that,'' said <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> <PERSON> Haosu </PERSON>, Vice Minister of Radio, Film and Television, the highest government official who attended the premiere. `` But why should we ask the foreign director to make films the same as we are used to seeing?'' he asked in his remarks at the movie's premiere. <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> said the film helped introduce <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to millions.

<TEXT>
 A group of idled airline passengers used the power of the pocketbook to avert a long layover on a <LOCATION> Portugese </LOCATION> island, paying to refuel a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 after an airport refused the pilot's credit card, <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> said Saturday The airline said the pilot of the London-bound flight raised $ 2,000 from among the 100 passengers after the <ORGANIZATION> Porto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Santo </ORGANIZATION> airport refused to accept the standard credit card used by pilots for refueling costs. One passenger even kicked in $ 1,000, said an airline spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity. The airline reimbursed the passengers on the Sept. 3 flight when they arrived at <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Gatwick </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, he said The snafu occurred during what should have been a routine refueling stop on the island in the north <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>, the spokesman said. The flight originated on the island of Funchal, which like <ORGANIZATION> Porto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Santo </ORGANIZATION>, is in the <LOCATION> Madeira </LOCATION> island group. <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> initially had planned to use a <ORGANIZATION> Gibralta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> aircraft for the flight, but because of a scheduling change used a chartered <ORGANIZATION> Caledonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> aircraft. When the flight landed at <LOCATION> Porto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Santo </LOCATION> to refuel, the ground staff refused to accept the credit card because the aircraft was not the one the airport had been expecting, the spokesman said. He said the fuel collection was a `` bit unorthodox, but it was done to save time. It is the first time I have heard of such a situation occurring.'' He said <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> has filed a complaint with the airport.

<DATELINE>YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Rain fell on Old Faithful on Saturday, as thousands of firefighters faced high wind that fanned already enormous forest fires, and Cabinet-level officials inspected damage to the oldest national park. A nearby mining town was evacuated and nonessential people were sent out of park headquarters. A storm with winds up to 30 mph and gusts of up to 40 mph measured near Mammoth moved south and east through <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> Saturday afternoon. But in most areas of <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>, `` things did n't get quite as intense as they thought probably they would,'' said <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, a spokeswoman at park headquarters at <LOCATION> Mammoth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hot </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>. About a quarter inch of rain fell in the <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> area, while scattered showers hit most of the southern half of the park. Fire information officials said puddles gathered in the roads and the rain quieted fire activity by increasing humidity in the area. All roads and entrances were closed to visitors Saturday, and reporters had to travel in convoys escorted by park personnel. `` We're making sure people do n't get into situations they ca n't get out of,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Marty </PERSON> <PERSON> Tobias </PERSON>. Interior Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> and Deputy Defense Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Taft </PERSON> <PERSON> IV </PERSON> arrived at <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, where they were briefed in private by fire and weather officials before going to Old Faithful geyser and flying over the park. `` I did n't think I'd ever see anything quite like <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Helens </LOCATION>, but I did here,'' <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> said. Fires have charred more than 906,000 acres of the 2.2-million-acre park. Adding destruction in the national forests and parks surrounding the park in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> pushes the figure to over 1.2 million burned acres. Fires also burned in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. So far this year, Western fires have burned nearly 3.8 million acres, an area larger than <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, in what officials call the worst fire season in 30 years. That includes some 2 million acres in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. The 229,400-acre North Fork fire had burned to within a mile of Mammoth Hot Springs and was slowly bearing down on the area, fire managers said. Nearly 400 firefighters were on hand to protect buildings. The Mammoth Hot Springs Inn, the last of the lodging facilities available in <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>, was closed Friday. It had been scheduled to stay open for the season until Sept. 19. The 650 residents of <LOCATION> Gardiner </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, which is at the north entrance to <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> and five miles north of <LOCATION> Mammoth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hot </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, stood ready to evacuate. <PERSON> Jardine </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, a mining community of 100 to 150 people four miles from <PERSON> Gardiner </PERSON>, was evacuated Saturday because its only escape route was through a canyon to <PERSON> Gardiner </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmitt </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Gallatin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>. A review of <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> policy on fighting wildfires will likely lead to changes after this year's devastating fires in the West, <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> said. `` In light of what has happened, we recognize you simply fight every fire as hard as you can from the beginning,'' <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> said to cheers from townspeople in the audience at a news conference in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mont </LOCATION>. `` I think they'd have to'' change, <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> said of the <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s so-called `` let burn'' policy in which natural fires are allowed to burn except where they threaten lives or property. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state, the bodies of two men were recovered Saturday from the burned wreckage of a helicopter that disappeared Friday while fighting that state's largest forest fire, a 46,000-acre blaze, said <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Thayer </PERSON>. The craft was found near a ridgetop north of <LOCATION> Wenatchee </LOCATION>, and recovery teams had to ride helicopters to the top of the ridge and hike down. <LOCATION> Chelan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> said the HU-204 `` Huey'' helicopter apparently snagged its empty water bucket on some trees and crashed. <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> said the victims were believed to be Canadians. Last month, one person died in the crash of a helicopter involved in battling a blaze in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Bighorn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>. The first death directly attributable to fires this year occurred last week in Glacier National Park in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, when a firefighter was struck by a falling, burning tree. In northeastern <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, residents who were driven from 50 homes in the tiny community of <LOCATION> Whiterocks </LOCATION> were allowed to return home Saturday. A fire in the <ORGANIZATION> Ashley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> had knocked down power lines to the community, and the residents were without power. Four mobile homes were destroyed by the fire, which surged to within a mile of the hamlet before being checked by firefighters and the weather.

<TEXT>
 The Children's Museum sent its 2,500-year-old mummy to the hospital Saturday to learn more about the ancient woman from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. During her visit to <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, Wenu-hotep got her picture taken with a three-dimensional CT scan that provided a never-before-seen view of her face. `` We found much finer pictures than I would have expected of the bones. These were incredibly clear and detailed images of the skull, the tissues, the internal bones of the skull,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON>, curator of anthropology for the museum. <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON> said the X-rays could be used later as the basis for artistic renderings to show what <PERSON> Wenu-hotep </PERSON>'s face looked like. The physical anthropologist said the scan also showed in detail the hole used to remove Wenu-hotep's brain during the mummification process, as well as resins and linen wrappings used to preserve the body. `` We also cleared up an old problem,'' he said. `` In X-rays taken about 1967 it appears there was a fracture of the left hip. We were able to show pretty conclusively there was not a fracture of the hip. In fact the hip appears to be normal.'' Interest in Wenu-hotep has increased dramatically in the two weeks since <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yurco </PERSON>, a Egyptological consultant from the <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Museum </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, performed new studies on her. Until then, scholars thought Wenu-hotep and her family were only of minor importance. But <PERSON> Yurco </PERSON> discovered that she was a pivotal mummy, meaning she provides totally new information about ancient <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Yurco </PERSON>'s detailed readings of the art and hieroglyphics on the coffin indicate Wenu-hotep's father, Hor-em-hat, was a high priest of Thoth, the most important deity of the time. <PERSON> Yurco </PERSON>'s study of the decoration on the coffin indicated that Wenu-hotep lived between 525 and 400 B.C., 200 years earlier than scholars previously thought; that she lived during a Persian rule of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>; and that she was a woman of wealth and power in her own right.

 Investigators worked Saturday to determine what caused a cloud of steam or smoke to drift onto Interstate 26, leading to a 17-vehicle pileup that killed four people and injured 16 others. `` I would n't even attempt to try to state a cause'' of the wreck, said state Highway Patrol Trooper V.R. <PERSON> Burkett </PERSON>. `` It's still under investigation.'' Witnesses said the road was wet from a fine mist when the accident occurred Friday after a cloud suddenly blocked visibility. Some witnesses suggested the cloud was steam from a nearby <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supply </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> plant, but company officials denied that was possible. <PERSON> Burkett </PERSON> said five tractor-trailers and 12 other vehicles were involved in the wreck, which occurred about 4:30 p.m. about 15 miles south of here. The highway was closed for 9 -LCB- hours. Five people remained hospitalized Saturday in stable or good condition. Eleven others were treated and released. The dead were <PERSON> Claire </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowie </PERSON>, 44, an interior designer from <LOCATION> Orangeburg </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> <PERSON> Felker </PERSON>, 5, of <PERSON> Whitmire </PERSON>; and two other persons whose identities were being withheld until they were positively confirmed, authorities said. <PERSON> Ruby </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON>, a witness, said, `` There was some steam coming from this plant over there, up in the air, and all of a sudden it just dropped.'' But plant manager <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Carver </PERSON> said he did not believe the welding supply company plant had anything to do with the accident. He said some gases are regularly released from the plant, but they normally dissipate within 10 feet of the 115-foot distillation tower. `` A review of our operation indicates everything was normal at the time of the accident,'' he said. <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> <PERSON> Malphrus </PERSON>, who was treated at a hospital and released, said she initially thought the cloud was harmless. `` I saw all these other cars going into the fog, so I just assumed it's not that thick, I guess, everyone's going into it,'' she said. `` Then once I was in it I realized there was no visibility. `` Then all of a sudden, bam, bam, bam, all of these cars started hitting each other. And then you heard screaming. It was a huge wreck,'' she said. `` Today was my birthday,'' she added. `` So maybe God just gave me a birthday present and let me live.''

<TEXT>
 A member of the Nicaraguan rebels' directorate on Saturday rejected the Sandinista government's offer of a meeting in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> to resume peace talks President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> on Friday suggested a meeting Sept. 19-20 in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> to discuss reopening high-level negotiations at a later date in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> to end the civil war. <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferrey </PERSON>, a member of the Nicaraguan Resistance said the rebels, known as Contras, could not accept the proposal. In a telephone interview from his office in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ferrey </PERSON> said, `` A preparatory meeting is n't necessary and peace talks would have to be somewhere other than <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>.'' During a June round of talks in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, Contra leaders said the government restricted their freedom of movement and any further talks would have to be in another Central American country. There has been a cease-fire in the 7-year-old civil war between the U.S.-backed rebels and the Sandinista government since March 21. But high-level negotiations to deal with a permanent truce broke down on June 9 in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> have extended the cease-fire month-by-month and the rebels have said they will abide by it. But each side has accused the other of violations. <PERSON> Ferrey </PERSON> also said the Contras want opposition parties inside <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> included in future peace talks.

 <PERSON> Yoko </PERSON> <PERSON> Ono </PERSON>, widow of slain Beatle composer and guitarist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON>, has denounced a biography of her husband by <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON> as `` all lies,'' according to <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sunday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION>. The weekly reported it was told by <PERSON> Ono </PERSON> at her home in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> that she contemplated suicide when she discovered what the American writer intended to publish in his book, `` The Lives of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON>.'' `` I've been undergoing character assassination for the past 20 years,'' she was quoted as saying. `` When this whole thing started, I kept thinking of -LRB- -LRB- Spanish painter <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON>'s wife and how she finally killed herself. Then I realized I could never do anything like that because I have my son <PERSON> Sean </PERSON>.'' The newspaper reported she rejected <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON>'s account that <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON> was brain-damaged from childhood, psychopathic, vindictive, cruel, homosexual and used to hit her. She said he never hit her once and if he felt like hitting anything he would punch a big pillow with both hands. The newspaper report said <PERSON> Ono </PERSON> was particularly hurt by <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON>'s assertion hat her love affair with <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON> was a cynical move to promote record sales It quoted her as saying <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON> was told as late as 1980 he could sell more records if he pretended not to be attached to one woman, but he refused. `` Neither of us was an angel. But we cherished and loved each moment we were together, and were always frightened of losing each other,'' <PERSON> Ono </PERSON> was quoted as saying. The Sunday Times said she believes a new film titled `` Imagine: <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON>,'' scheduled to be shown next month, `` is her best defense against <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION>'' as it was compiled from footage of their life together after the Beatles musical group broke up in 1970. <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>, who wrote `` Shout.

<HEAD>Police Say Drug Dealers May Be Striking Back At Anti-Drug
Activists</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Investigators say the home of an anti-drug activist was torched and at least two other activists have reported threats. `` I was hurting somebody's business, stepping on somebody's toes,'' <PERSON> Lottie </PERSON> <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON> said after her home burned in a fire blamed by authorities on arsonists Ms. <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON> was appointed last month by Mayor <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> <PERSON> Goode </PERSON> to his new Leadership Anti-Drug Council. <PERSON> Goode </PERSON> ordered a full investigation of Friday's fire that heavily damaged Ms. <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON>'s home Ms. <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON>, 47, organized and led three anti-drug marches in her neighborhood in June. She has stood with neighbors in front of drug houses and demanded that the dealers leave. If the arson was in retaliation for her anti-drug work, <PERSON> Goode </PERSON> said, then `` it is one more tragic example of the recklessness of drug dealers in the city, and reaffirms the resolve of this administration to push even harder to drive the pushers out of the city.'' Arsonists used a five-gallon plastic container to carry flammable liquid to the second floor of Ms. <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON>'s home, investigators said. The fluid was poured in a rear bedroom and down a back staircase. Earlier in the week, District Attorney <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Castille </PERSON> and two city council members rallied with tenants of a public housing complex, <ORGANIZATION> Abbottsford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Homes </ORGANIZATION>, where some tenants reported threats. <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Betty </PERSON>, who spoke on condition their last names not be used, said they received death threats after five people were arrested on drug charges last month in the complex. In June, the two had helped lead tenants through the complex, chanting slogans such as `` Drug dealers got to go.'' That slogan was mimicked by the death threat displayed by <PERSON> Betty </PERSON>: `` Newsy neighbors got to go before you land on death row!!'' The message was accompanied by a stick figure drawing of a person with a noose around the neck, and beside it the words `` This is you.'' <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Kern </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>, said he was negotiating with police to open a mini-police station at <LOCATION> Abbottsford </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Castille </PERSON> said he and <PERSON> Kern </PERSON> would try to enforce new federal legislation that enables district attorneys to facilitate the eviction of alleged drug-dealing tenants from public housing units. While the housing authority already has the power to evict those who sell drugs from their apartments, those evictions come slowly.

 Foreign ministers of the 101-nation non-aligned movement closed a four-day meeting early Sunday after adopting resolutions condemning <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. In their political report, the ministers said there was `` increased cooperation between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,'' and expressed `` indignation and dismay that certain Western nations.. continued to aid and abet apartheid economically, financially, politically, diplomatically and militarily.'' They noted `` with regret'' that, despite efforts to press leading industrialized countries to impose mandatory economic sanctions against white-ruled <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> had again been prevented from adopting sanctions by American and British vetoes. The document expressed disappointment that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> increased its trade with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, whose apartheid policies establish a racially segregated society in which the 5 million whites control the country and the 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. It called on member states `` to begin in earnest the stockpiling of relief materials for appropriate use in support of the front-line and other states in southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, to assist them to withstand reprisals by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has been accused of launching raids in neighboring black countries to strike at the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the main guerrilla group fighting the white-led government. The final document `` strongly condemned the hypocrisy of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration and the <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> racist regime for talking peace'' in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> while continuing to provide military support to the <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> rebels fighting the Marxist government in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. With regard to the Palestinian attempts to establish a homeland in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, the report said, `` The ministers saluted the heroic uprising of the Palestinian people in the -LRB- <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> -RRB- occupied territories.'' It said the uprising was `` tangible evidence of their determination to have a state of their own, which proves the futility of the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> efforts to continue the occupation of Palestine.'' The final report also said a <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> settlement should be based `` on the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and their right to establish an independent and sovereign Palestinian state in their national homeland, <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>.'' The report called on both <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> to cooperate in good faith with the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> secretary-general for full implementation of the UN-sponsored cease-fire in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war, which went into effect on Aug. 20. The non-aligned movement was formed in 1961 by nations claiming not to be aligned with the East or West. Before adjourning, the foreign ministers decided early Sunday that <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> will host next year's summit meeting and have the chairmanship for the next three years.

<HEAD>Editors Aren't Splitting Hairs Over Split Infinitives</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Newspaper and magazine editors are less likely to split hairs these days over split infinitives, according to an <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> English usage survey. `` It's time to boldly go where few editors have gone before,'' said the response of the Allentown Call, a <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> newspaper participating in the survey. `` If the sentence would be awkward otherwise, we should split the infinitive and not split hairs.'' The move was in sharp contrast to the university's language survey in 1981, when 88 percent of the editors said they would obey one of the most ancient of grammatical rules: Never split an infinitive. The copy chiefs were asked if they would shift the word `` instantly'' in the following sentence: `` The estimated 100 million Americans whose relatives arrived in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Ellis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> will be able to instantly trace their history at the new computerized genealogical center planned for the restored immigration site.'' About half _ 52 percent _ said they would not change the sentence, which appeared in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. However, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>' assistant managing editor, <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Siegal </PERSON>, objected to his paper's split of the infinitive `` to trace `` It was a violation of our own policy,'' <PERSON> Siegal </PERSON> said. `` We split an infinitive when we can not gracefully avoid doing so. In this case, the graceful placement of the adverb would have been after ` history.' Split infinitives are n't wrong, but they annoy so many readers that they should be avoided when possible.'' But the <ORGANIZATION> Indianapolis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> disagreed with <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. `` Splitting infinitives is no longer a slavish matter. We treat them individually, rather than a matter of course.'' Many newspaper and magazine editors found failure to split an infinitive awkward in certain contexts. Most infinitives are split by an intensive modifier, as in `` to really try,'' `` to honestly believe'' and `` to heartily support.'' Other findings of the survey included a rejection of the word `` chairperson'' instead of `` chairwoman'' or `` chairman,'' and a lack of affection for the use of `` like'' as a conjunction, as in, `` She ate like she had n't had a square meal in at least a month.'' The 10th English poll was conducted by <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tobin </PERSON>, a professor in the <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journalism </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Iraq Protests U.S. Stand on Alleged Use of Chemical Weapons
Against Kurds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Iraqi foreign minister said Saturday that a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> call for economic sanctions against his country for allegedly using chemical weapons against Kurdish rebels was ridiculous and unacceptable. Kurdish separatists praised the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> action, which they said came amid continued heavy fighting in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s mountainous north. Minister of Information <PERSON> Latif </PERSON> <PERSON> Nassayif </PERSON> <PERSON> Jassim </PERSON> denied all reports accusing <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> of using chemical weapons against the rebellious Kurds, the official <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported. <ORGANIZATION> INA </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Jassem </PERSON> as saying, `` All the allegations aired by certain political and media circles are ridiculous.'' He called the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote unacceptable and said <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> can not speak out about human rights while it is arming <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s forces for their attacks against Palestinians, according to the agency. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s latest offensive against Kurdish separatists began soon after a U.N.-mediated cease-fire was accepted Aug. 20 by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> in their 8-year-old war. Many Kurdish separatists had backed <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in the conflict. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted Friday to condemn <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s alleged poison gas attacks on its Kurdish minority and to impose stiff economic sanctions aimed at throttling <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s ability to pay off its estimated $ 60-billion debt. The measure, following the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement that it had proof of the attacks, still must be approved by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> and signed by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. A spokesman for the Kurdish rebels said the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> action proved the separatists' accusations about chemical weapons. `` The <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION> has its own evidence through its own sources which proves what we've been saying for a month,'' the spokesman said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. He spoke on condition of anonymity. The spokesman, speaking from a <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> capital where he maintains radio contact with the insurgents, said the fighting is continuing in the northern Kurdish regions. He said Iraqi forces were concentrated along the border with <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, where he claimed 40,000 Kurds trying to escape were trapped. `` We are trying to rescue as many people as we can but we have n't had much news from them in the last few days,'' he said, adding that there was heavy fighting Sept. 6 and 7. He said 80 Iraqis were killed in the fighting in the northern <LOCATION> Amadiyeh </LOCATION> district Sept. 7 and most rebel fighters had withdrawn. In <LOCATION> Sidikan </LOCATION> on Sept. 6, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> launched a `` massive attack'' and lost 200 of its soldiers in the battle, according to the spokesman. He said 250 guerrillas had been killed since Aug. 26. Last week the rebels said 2,000 civilians have been killed and 5,000 wounded, many in chemical bomb attacks. Chemical weeapons are banned internationally under the 1925 <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accords. Diplomats in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> said that since March <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has demolished scores of Kurdish villages in the north, moving the inhabitants to blocks of concrete apartment buildings in larger cities.

<HEAD>Talks Fail To Settle Cuban Withdrawal Date</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRAZZAVILLE, Congo (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Officials from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> failed Friday to resolve the key issue of when Cuban troops will withdraw from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, a South African official said. But the official said some progress was made during the two-day meeting that ended Friday and that a cease-fire remained in force. He said further talks will be scheduled. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has made independence for <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> contingent on the withdrawl of Cuban troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, where anti-Marxist rebels are fighting the Soviet-backed government. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has administered the territory, also known as <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, for 73 years in violation of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolutions. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s military said two pro-independence rebels and two members of the security forces were killed in a shootout in the northern <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Oshikati </LOCATION>. The Wednesday skirmish between guerrillas of the <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and the security forces was the latest of several battles between the two sides since <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> said it would begin observing a cease-fire Sept. 1. South African President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> has said the Angolan peace talks, one of a series of negotiations mediated by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, would first deal with reports of recent Cuban troop reinforcements in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. He said if the reports were true, they would constitute a violation of the month-old cease-fire agreement. <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> denied the claims, saying troop ships en route to <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> carried replacements for the 50,000 soldiers already there. The Cuban troops help <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s Marxist government battle the guerrillas and South African forces. The anti-Marxist force _ <PERSON> Jonas </PERSON> <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>'s Union for the Total Independence of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> _ has been fighting the Marxist government since <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> granted <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> independence in 1975. The chief of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> delegation, <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Heerden </PERSON>, said the talks allowed the two sides `` to make significant progress on the problem.'' `` We are going to study the proposals thatarose during the course of the discussions'' and the parties will consult with their governments before deciding on a date and venue for new talks, he said. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Heerden </PERSON>, director-general of the foreign affairs department, declined to give details on the talks. But he said <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> would continue with its plan to begin implementation of a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>' plan for independence for <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. South African Foreign Minister <PERSON> Pik </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, at a news briefing in <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> after his country's delegation returned, said all parties at the talks had agreed to intensify their efforts to agree on a timetable. He said they also discussed funding for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>' proposed independence plan for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s demand that <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla bases in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> be removed

 A <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> F-14 Tomcat jet fighter crashed in the northern Arabian Sea earlier this week but both crewmen escaped serious injury, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. The two-seat fighter, assigned to Squadron VF-111 at the <LOCATION> Miramar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, was flying off the carrier USS <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Vinson </PERSON> on a `` routine training flight'' when it was forced to ditch at sea Thursday night, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> added the cause of the crash was now under investigation, but one <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> official who asked not to be named said the plane had suffered `` a mechanical problem.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said the pilot ditched the Tomcat about 40 miles from the carrier and that both the pilot and his weapon's officer were subsequently rescued by a helicopter from the Vinson. One of the two suffered minor injuries while bailing out, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said, adding it did not have the identities of the crewmen available.

<HEAD>Reagan Signs Fishing Vessel Safety Bill</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Friday signed into law a measure that for the first time requires commercial fishing vessels to carry life rafts and other emergency equipment. The signing caps a three-year campaign for approval of safety regulations for an industry whose safety record is the worst in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, R-Wash., who attended the private signing ceremony and was one of the original sponsors of the measure, said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> called it a `` good bill that will save lives. The measure requires that commercial fishing vessels carry life rafts, survival suits, emergency transmitters and medical supplies.

He said more needs to be done, including manadatory inspections on a regular basis, licensing of operators and training of crews. An average of about 80 fishermen die annually in accidents involving commercial fishing vessels, according to <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> statistics.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> on Friday accused <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> of wasting time in negotiations for a settlement of their 8-year-old war, and the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> mediator was reported ready to call a recess. A written Iraqi statement dismissed <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s position as `` fantasy to explain its flight from direct talks lately as a result of the instability of the government it represents.'' The Iraqi statement said negotiations can not move past basic cease-fire arrangements without action on two of the <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> government's demands: free navigation in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> and U.N.-supervised clearing of the Shatt-al-Arab waterway, which forms the southern frontier. The waterway, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s only outlet to the gulf, has been blocked by sunken ships and silt since the early weeks of the war, which began in September 1980. On Thursday, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> repeated the Iranian position that those issues were `` extraneous elements'' and could be addressed later. <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> said negotiations have been hung up the agenda disagreement since they began Aug. 25, five days after a cease-fire took effect. He said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s priority is withdrawal of military forces to internationally recognized boundaries. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> was giving a false picture and that <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> had stated its position in two letters to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> before the talks began, `` so the raising of these two issues is neither extraneous nor new.'' The statement said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> was procrastinating and <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> should `` get down to business.'' Direct talks occurred only on the first two days in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> and neither <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> nor the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> foreign minister, <PERSON> Tariq </PERSON> <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON>, has met with <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> mediator <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Eliasson </PERSON> since last Saturday. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> was mediator when the talks began, but put <PERSON> Eliasson </PERSON> in charge Sept. 1. Signs increased Friday that the talks will recess and resume later this month in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Therese </PERSON> <PERSON> Gastaut </PERSON> said continuing low-level, indirect contacts were focusing on `` how to proceed'' and <PERSON> Eliasson </PERSON>, a Swedish diplomat, probably would hold a news conference Saturday or Sunday. Sources close to the talks said privately he was expected to announce a recess but there still was disagreement over a date for resumption.

<HEAD>Woman Ordered By Judge To Avoid Pregnancy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A woman who admitted allowing her 3-month-old child to die of starvation was ordered Friday by a judge not to become pregnant during her five-year probation. <PERSON> Stella </PERSON> <PERSON> Belona </PERSON>, 23, pleaded guilty in June to manslaughter with the understanding that she would not be sentenced to more than 10 years in prison. According to probation terms set down by State District Judge <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON>, <PERSON> Belona </PERSON> must not become pregannt while under court supervision. According to a police report, <PERSON> Arell </PERSON> <PERSON> Belona </PERSON> died Nov. 30, 1987, from malnutrition so severe that he `` appeared mummified.'' The infant had not been fed in three days, investigators said. `` This is a welfare mother who had no resources,'' defense attorney <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Richey </PERSON> said. `` What welfare meant to her was if she could get a ride, then she could get food stamps.'' <PERSON> Belona </PERSON> told police she had wanted to take the child to a doctor, but had no transportation. Authorities said the child's weight had dropped from about 7 pounds at birth to less than 6 pounds at death. <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Belona </PERSON> was pregnant when she dropped out of school in the seventh grade at age 16. In addition to a requirement that she not become pregnant, <PERSON> Belona </PERSON> was ordered to live at a rehabilitation residence, learn to read, obtain a high school equivalency certificate and undergo job training. <PERSON> Belona </PERSON>'s three other children _ ages 3, 2 and 1 _ appeared not to suffer abuse, authorities said. They have been turned over to child protection officers. A judge in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> last week reversed her order that a teen-age mother, who left her two sons alone in a sweltering apartment for three days, practice birth control throughout her child-bearing years. The judge said her order was unenforceable since no method of birth control is fool-proof.

 The chief air traffic controller in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> has been pulled off his job because he allegedly hitched too many free rides on commercial airliners, a federal official said. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Abernathy </PERSON> is being investigated for possible abuse of the `` flight familiarization'' program, which allows controllers to ride in cockpits to observe flight procedures. <PERSON> Abernathy </PERSON>, who oversees 300 controllers, has been temporarily replaced during the investigation, <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, said Thursday. Under the flight familiarization program, controllers are limited to eight free rides a year, and only one can be international. <PERSON> Abernathy </PERSON>, who has worked for the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> for 24 years and has headed the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> office since January 1985, could have his flight privileges suspended for two years if the abuse is proved, <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> said.

 Bleachers in a high school gymnasium collapsed Friday during a junior assembly, injuring at least 78 people and creating `` major chaos,'' authorities reported. None of the injuries was described as serious. The entire junior class, about 300 students, was attending the assembly at <ORGANIZATION> Maurice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> J. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> McDonough </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> when the steel bleachers gave way shortly after 8 a.m., said <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Dent-Brown </PERSON>, administrative assistant for the <ORGANIZATION> Charles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Dent-Brown </PERSON> said she did n't know how many students were on the bleacher that collapsed. The 16-foot bleachers had a seating capacity of 175. Charles County Fire Chief <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON> said it appeared a section of the bleachers came apart. `` When we got here, it was basically major chaos,'' <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON> said. `` We had students, teachers in the bleachers trying to comfort one another. A lot of victims, a lot of pain and agony going on. A few of the students were actually still in the bleachers themselves.'' The incident was under investigation, officials said. `` It sounded like fireworks or a shotgun. It sounded like a whole bunch of shots were going on. It was scary,'' one student told <ORGANIZATION> WUSA-TV </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` It was like you saw them -LRB- the bleachers -RRB- and then you did n't see them. ... They went one at a time, but real fast. It was like dominoes.'' Thirteen people were admitted to hospitals, including four who were flown by helicopter to Prince <PERSON> George </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cheverly </LOCATION>. They were in satisfactory condition Friday afternoon, hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Rosie </PERSON> <PERSON> Cobb </PERSON> said. At least 65 persons were treated and released.

<HEAD>U.S. Carrier Wins Ruling Against Japanese Restrictions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government said Friday it will restrict <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> air freight rights of Japanese airlines unless <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> allows Flying Tiger Line, an all-cargo American carrier, to operate unrestricted Europe-Alaska-Japan service. Accusing <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> of discriminating against Flying Tiger in violation of the two countries' air transport agreements, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> declared that it will `` impose such sanctions as are necessary'' against Japanese carriers. The department approved a complaint by Los Angeles-based Flying Tiger charging that the Japanese government had unfairly sought to restrict traffic on its proposed Europe-to-Tokyo freight service via <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. It asked the department to restrict <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cargo operations by Japanese lines `` sufficient to compensate for the restrictions'' on Flying Tiger. `` The Japanese limitations on Flying Tiger's proposed operations simply can not be reconciled with Flying Tiger's rights'' under government agreements, and `` moreover, those Japanese-imposed limitations subjected Flying Tiger to patently discriminatory treatment,'' the department said in its decision. The department said it would hold up retaliation against Japanese companies pending the outcome of negotiations between the two governments Sept. 19-22 in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. This was requested by <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION>, one of two Japanese carriers ordered by the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to provide data about its freight services in preparation for further <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> action. The other was <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cargo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. The department said it will be `` prepared to act expeditiously to impose effective countermeasures in the event that diplomatic initiatives do not resolve the dispute.'' The department said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> failed to approve Flying Tiger's <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo-Alaska </ORGANIZATION> schedules unless it would accept `` unreasonable and unjustifiable `` reporting requirements and route restrictions

 Fire roared through a museum housing one of the nation's largest collections of wax figures Friday, destroying many detailed recreations of moments from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> history. Almost 300 meticulously sculpted wax figures at the <ORGANIZATION> Southwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Historical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> _ ranging from <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> <PERSON> Presley </PERSON> to <PERSON> John </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> to <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Redford </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> _ were lost in the blaze. `` One of the things that has made this fire so difficult to fight was the fact these figures are just like a candle,'' said Lt. <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Conner </PERSON>. `` They generate tremendous heat. It appears it's totally destroyed. `` This was a major attraction in the community,'' said Mayor <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Debo </PERSON>. `` It continued to be a major draw when other attractions failed.'' More than 100 firefighters brought the blaze under control nearly three hours after the fire was first reported at the 25-year-old museum, officials said. One firefighter suffered minor injuries when a high-pressure fire hose broke, <PERSON> Conner </PERSON> said. He was treated and released from <ORGANIZATION> DFW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Sonny </PERSON> <PERSON> Marston </PERSON>, operations manager for the Plaza Theater of Wax in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, which is owned by the Grand Prairie museum, said the company still has about 250 wax figures at its location across from the <LOCATION> Alamo </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Marston </PERSON> said. `` We do n't know much about the loss yet,'' <PERSON> Marston </PERSON> said of the fire. `` But it's a temporary setback.'' Popular attractions included the swearing-in of <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> following <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s assassination, figures of movie actresses born in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, and bank robbers <PERSON> Bonnie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON>, who grew up just a few miles away.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Commerce Secretary <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Verity </PERSON> opened a campaign Friday to sell the <LOCATION> Japanese </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> goods ranging from speedboats to cat food. The drive has the approval of the Japanese government and the powerful <ORGANIZATION> Keidanren </ORGANIZATION>, or Federation of Economic Organizations. The <ORGANIZATION> Keidanren </ORGANIZATION> presented a lunch that included <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> orange juice, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> beef and Budweiser beer to show the growing acceptance of American imports. <ORGANIZATION> Verity </ORGANIZATION> brought executives of 25 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies to <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> to study the Japanese market and meet government officials. `` Now is the time to come and do business in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Hajime </PERSON> <PERSON> Tamura </PERSON>, minister of international trade and industry, said in welcoming the group. In a speech to some 70 Japanese executives at <LOCATION> Keidanren </LOCATION> headquarters, <ORGANIZATION> Verity </ORGANIZATION> said many trade disputes between <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have been resolved in the past year. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> wants to reduce <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s huge trade surplus with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by selling more in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> rather than by restricting Japanese imports to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, he said. `` Our firms are now very price competitive'' because of the dollar's fall since 1985, and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is removing trade barriers, <ORGANIZATION> Verity </ORGANIZATION> told the businessmen. He said the next thing required is `` an intensive effort by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> firms to learn about and then develop imaginative and sound ways to penetrate the Japanese distribution system in order to reach the consumer.'' <ORGANIZATION> Verity </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Tamura </PERSON> call the campaign `` Market <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> _ with <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s best.'' They agreed in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in June to focus their first effort on five areas of consumer products: Leisure goods, sporting goods, jewelry, furniture and processed foods including juices and pet food. Companies on the trade mission include <ORGANIZATION> Ralston-Purina </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>; Ladd Furniture of High Point, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>; Cigarette Racing Team of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Woodstream </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Lititz </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Utility's Nuclear Plant Gets Evacuation OK</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HICKSVILLE, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> nuclear plant, which earlier this year seemed destined for mothballs, received a high rating for the work of <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lighting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> workers in an emergency evacuation drill, a federal report showed. The positive report from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> came despite the refusal of state and <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> officials to cooperate because they claimed evacuation of the island was impossible in the event of a real accident. `` The <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> monster is rising from its grave,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kessel </PERSON>, the executive director of the state consumer protection board and a long-time <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> opponent, after the <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION> rating was issued. The two-day drill, which began June 7, tested how <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION> responded to a simulated plant accident that required mock evacuation of residents living within 10 miles of the plant. State and local officials said in June that <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION> showed it was incapable of protecting the public because a majority of emergency sirens in the evacuation zone failed or were not heard during the drill. But <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION> officials said at the time that sounding the sirens was not a required part of the exercise. Under current federal regulation, the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> may not license a nuclear plant until there is an emergency plan that gives reasonable assurance the public will be safe if an accident occurs. <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Lois </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION> told the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> in its report Friday that the utility proved in the drill that its plan did provide reasonable assurance. According to <PERSON> Lois </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION>'s evaluation of the June exercise and the emergency plan itself support a finding of reasonable assurance that the health and the safety of the public will be carried out. If the plan is acceptable to the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> licensing board, it removes emergency planning as an obstacle to issuance of a full power operating license for a plant, <PERSON> Lois </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kessel </PERSON>, saying he was extremely disappointed in the <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION> decision, charged the federal agency `` turned logic upside down'' in its ruling. Earlier this year, Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> _ another <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> opponent _ helped work out a deal to purchase the nuclear plant from <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION> and shut it down for good. But the plan has yet to be approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>, meaning that it still is possible for <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> to one day go into operation.

 Hundreds of evacuees returned to their homes under sunny skies Friday to find water-logged carpets and damaged furniture from a flood that claimed at least six lives. <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> dried out from four days of torrential rains that sent rivers surging over their banks. `` Today, we have sunshine and dry feet,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> worker <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Crutchfield </PERSON> as shelters closed in <LOCATION> Pinellas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. The shelters had housed 160 people overnight. Weather forecasters said the near-stationary front responsible for the battering storm continued to drift north. The storm system was not connected with Hurricane <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION>, which was roaring up the southeast <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> coast Friday. Forecasters said Friday it did n't appear as if the storm system would join forces with Hurricane <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION>. Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> took an aerial tour of hardest-hit <LOCATION> Manatee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and said afterward he would sign an executive order Saturday declaring a state of emergency to pave the way for state crews to help assess damage and clear debris. County public works officials estimated between $ 12 and $ 24 million in damages to 37 bridges. Although flooding was subsiding, <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said he could see from the air effects of the monsoon-like downpours that dumped 15 inches of rain in two days, pushed the <LOCATION> Manatee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> 9 feet above flood stage and swelled the county's reservoir to the highest level since 1974. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> predicted the county would qualify for federal disaster assistance. He said state assessment teams would collect damage data from homeowners to determine if the county met federal disaster relief criteria. The flooding prompted local officials to declare a state of emergency Wednesday and order the evacuation of 1,000 people. Many returned home Thursday. Throughout the <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area, waterfront residents spent Friday ripping out soaked carpets, patching leaky roofs and stacking ruined furniture in garages or on front lawns. While flood waters were subsiding in <LOCATION> Manatee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hillsborough </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pinellas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pasco </LOCATION> counties, trouble spots remained. In <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, traffic was diverted around a closed stretch of flooded Interstate 4, a key artery and hurricane evacuation route. The <LOCATION> Alafia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> southeast of <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> crested Friday at 7 feet above flood stage, covering cars and riverfront homes up to the roofline. West across <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION>, overflowing creeks swamped streets and homes in scattered communities leaving people in low-lying areas wading through knee-deep water.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sun-Times </ORGANIZATION> is asking its editorial staff to take a 15 percent salary cut and accept reductions in other benefits and the elimination of overtime pay, staff members say. A union memo posted at the newspaper Friday presented the management offer, which proposes a three-year contract with staff members taking a 15 percent pay cut the first year, confirmed a staffer who asked not to be identified. Editorial staffers would get a 5 percent raise the second year of the contract and a 10 percent raise in the third, he said. Sun-Times Executive Editor <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Towers </PERSON> refused to comment on the memo. Officials at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION>, which represents about 280 reporters, photographers, copy editors, assistant city editors, library staff and other workers, could not immediately be reached for comment. The offer called for the elimination of overtime pay and would throw out a 10 percent bonus for working at night. Instead of overtime pay, the <ORGANIZATION> Sun-Times </ORGANIZATION> proposed giving additional time off to those who work overtime. The proposal would also increase the amount of time employees work from 7 -LCB- hours a day to 8 hours a day, eliminate severence pay and allow workers to be terminated if their jobs become obsolete because of advances in technology. The newspaper and the union have been negotiating for a new contract. The old pact expired May 31, but employees have been working under its terms. The memo comes one month after <ORGANIZATION> Sun-Times </ORGANIZATION> president and publisher <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Page </PERSON> resigned, two years after spearheading a $ 145 million buyout of the newspaper from Australian publisher <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON> <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON>.

 Money-losing <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> eliminated 4,000 more jobs Saturday in the `` downsizing'' it says it needs to survive, but the unions charged that the cutbacks are actually making the airline less competitive. The cuts, which are being contested in court by the unions, reduced <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s workforce to fewer than 30,000. Less than four years ago, it had 42,000 workers. Eastern eliminated 12 percent of its routes two weeks ago, ending service to 14 cities. Laid-off workers with seniority can transfer to other cities, `` bumping'' newer employees out of their jobs. Thus, newer employees could take the brunt of the layoffs when the bumping is complete.

 The floods that inundate this poor, overpopulated nation with deadly regularity are a combination of man-made and natural phenomena. This year's deluge _ the most devastating in memory _ has claimed more than 600 lives by government count and more than 1,400 according to newspapers. It has submerged three-quarters of the country, spawning disease and destroying homes, roads, bridges, schools and food warehouses.

 <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> `` Be Bop'' <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> goes wherever blues great B.B. King travels. The two men have been inseparable since 1952 when King got into <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>' taxi in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` I'm right there with the band every day. I'm writing a book, ` B.B. King, Then and Now,''' <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said in an interview at his home in Mobile. King is 64. <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, a great-grandfather of four, will be 65 in November. Neither plans to retire soon. `` He stays polished,'' <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, now the singer's road manager, began as his valet. `` I was driving a taxi cab for a studio. This guy that owned the cab line owned a couple of recording companies. He had me go to the hotel and take King to his lawyer's office to sign the papers to start recording.'' <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> parked his cab that day and left with King. `` From that date to this one, I've been with him.'' King started in the early days playing black clubs around the country. `` That was from the'50s until the early part of the'60s,'' <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said. `` King's fortunes changed when he guest-starred with <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Clapton </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jimi </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendrix </PERSON> and <PERSON> Janis </PERSON> <PERSON> Joplin </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Fillmore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> -RRB-. When he made the record, ` The Thrill Is Gone,' that was the major change. `` The crowd now is 75 to 80 percent white. Deep South, the crowd is more black,'' <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said. `` It varies with the territory.'' <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> moved to Mobile 25 years ago and began operating restaurants and nightclubs. Everything was called `` Be <PERSON> Bop </PERSON>'s'' _ record shop, social club, chicken shack and lately his tamale plaza. `` We sell hot tamales and boudin -LRB- a Cajun sausage with rice -RRB-. The tamales come from <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, the boudin is from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>,'' he said. When he gets the call from <PERSON> Polly </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s secretary in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> goes on the road. Her husband, <PERSON> Cato </PERSON>, who died this summer, was King's long-time bus driver, and her two daughters worked for King. She said they all have been friends for life. `` I grew up across the street from King's house in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> has been with King the longest of his co-workers. He takes his wife, <PERSON> Lillie </PERSON>, with him on concert trips when possible. Bus driver <PERSON> Barnett </PERSON> <PERSON> Fogg </PERSON> has been with them 11 years, and tenor sax <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Synagal </PERSON> has nine years with the group. The King show has made two European trips this year, in March and July. <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said they hit 29 cities. `` Every day it was a different language, different money, different food,'' <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said. `` I've been going to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> for the last 20 years. I'm going twice again before Christmas.'' <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> does n't play any instrument. `` I do n't handle nothing but money and writing checks. But I know music, I've got to know music to hire and fire.'' King, he said, is all blues: `` If B.B. King sang the national anthem, it would be bluesy.'' King, who lives in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, rose to fame from humble bginnings in <LOCATION> Indianola </LOCATION>, Miss. With a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> agent, his performance itinerary runs nearly year-round. `` He's got people, family all over the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said. He said <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s favorite place is his home in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, but King recently purchased a new bus manufactured in <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>. `` It took them nine months to make it to B.B. King's specifications. The same thing that's in a Stouffer's hotel is in that bus. `` When we're traveling down the highway, people take pictures of it from their cars,'' <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said. The group does as much flying as bus travel. That's all in stark contrast to the early days, when the band got around in a few station wagons and a Cadillac. Back then, they were worried about being able to use public restrooms because they were segregated and black people were not permitted to use them. <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said he has kept Mobile as his home base because of his family and business interests. He has stayed despite the lack of major entertainment _ blues or jazz. `` The people here are not ready for it,'' he said. `` They wo n't support it A lot of people notice it, but it's the less supporting entertainment city in the world. For what reason, I do n't know.''

 <PERSON> Biba </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdou </PERSON>'s children, all skin and bones, were smiling from ear-to-ear as they played beside the family's 10-food-high millet crop, the best they had ever seen `` My boys are skinny now, but soon they will be fat,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Biba </PERSON>, whose family farms near <LOCATION> Karma </LOCATION>, about 35 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Niger </LOCATION>'s capital, <LOCATION> Niamey </LOCATION>. `` We have never seen rain like this. We are very content.'' For the moment, a drought-weary people have reason to smile. All across <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s Sahel, abundant rains promise the best harvest in two decades. Nothing comes easy in the Sahel, a huge belt of land on the southern fringe of the <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION>, and the good rains are no exception. More than 100 lives were lost in torrential rains, thousands of homes destroyed and some farmland flooded. An infestation of locusts also threatens some crops, although the most immediate threat appears to be to the east in <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Niger </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> rose to levels higher than any recorded in August since record-keeping began in 1928. Scientists at a <LOCATION> Niamey </LOCATION> agricultural weather center, set up to monitor conditions in nine Sahel nations after the disastrous 1972-73 drought, report the plentiful rain promises good harvests. Good pasturage is available for cattle, goats, sheep. The Sahel region is generally defined as covering the land south of the <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION> with annual rainfall averaging from six to 24 inches. It stretches from <LOCATION> Mauritania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mali </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Niger </LOCATION> in the north into northern <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION> and northern <LOCATION> Cameroon </LOCATION> in the south. Many Sahel regions had already received more than 14 inches, the amount needed for millet crops, by the end of August. More important, the rain had continued to fall since the beginning of June. The crop needs rainfall throughout its three-month growth for the best harvests. The Sahel nations _ <PERSON> Burkina </PERSON> <PERSON> Faso </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Verde </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Niger </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mauritania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mali </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bissau </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gambia </LOCATION> _ have suffered recurring drought or generally inadequate rainfall since 1972. The nine nations cover more than 2 million square miles and have a population of about 40 million. <PERSON> Amadou </PERSON> <PERSON> Djibo </PERSON>, who farms with his father and three brothers about 60 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Niamey </LOCATION>, said people were n't concerned about losing their homes or flooding that had temporarily cut off an important road. Like the marabou storks who circled overhead, the rains were considered a harbinger of better days. `` We can always rebuild a house, but if we have no rain, we have no food,'' he said. <PERSON> Djibo </PERSON> added that his village of <LOCATION> Zarakoire </LOCATION>, had not had an adequate harvest in seven years and life was hard. <PERSON> Boukar </PERSON> <PERSON> Elhadj </PERSON> <PERSON> Ousmane </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Niger </LOCATION>'s minister in charge of animal and water resources, said the rains had left 13 people dead and 7,000 homeless. He also reported 15,000 animals, including goats, sheep and cattle, lost and about 600 miles of roads left temporarily impassable. Heavy rainfall has been reported across <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, extending into <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> where torrential rains and flooding resulted in 96 deaths and $ 200 million in damage. In the Sahel, <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION> reported 45 people dead and 48,000 homeless and 3,500 cattle lost. More than 50 people were killed in northern <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION> and thousands left homeless; two dams burst after the heaviest rainfalls in 50 years. <LOCATION> Cameroon </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Burkina </PERSON> <PERSON> Faso </PERSON> also reported several deaths and many houses destroyed. Much flood damage was reported near rivers, where people had moved in close to the water during drought years to plant gardens. <PERSON> Boukar </PERSON> said he could understand the attitude of peasants who minimized the importance of the damage, and said, `` We can consider the rain a blessing.'' He added, `` It gives them hope for the future. Many of those people have never seen this kind of rain in their lives. They have only heard stories about it.'' <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Eaton </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Niger </LOCATION>'s director of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- AID -RRB-, which was still distributing food donated to meet shortfalls from the last harvest, said <LOCATION> Niger </LOCATION>'s food situation should be good after this harvest. `` That's if the locusts do n't eat it all, or if there is so much there is still enough for the people.'' <PERSON> Eaton </PERSON> said he had received reports of good harvest prospects from AID directors in other Sahel nations. `` This has been a great morale booster, even with the locust threat,'' he added. `` People are upbeat.'' Some harvesting already has begun in southern <LOCATION> Sahel </LOCATION> regions, where crops mature earlier. But in most areas millet, sorghum and other crops will be harvested in the coming weeks. No one predicts an end to food shortages, though given the probable reduction in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> food aid because of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drought the Sahel rains were timely. Each Sahel country has its own troubles, and the rain certainly would create some problems, even if it alleviated others. And no one predicts that the drought cycle had been broken by the rains. Indeed, scientists here would make no predictions at all, noting a meterological institute had predicted three months ago that the Sahel would experience a very dry year this year. Aid workers expressed concern the good rains will encourage pastoralists to rebuild their herds, cut by as much as 50 percent by the massive 1984 drought, to sizes the land ca n't support. Overgrazing has been a key factor in desertification, the process by which the <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION> claims land. A pastoralist's herd remains his bank and chief wealth in the <LOCATION> Sahel </LOCATION> and governments have had little success dissuading their herdsmen from overgrazing the fragile land.

<TEXT>
 Puerto Ricans vote for a governor, legislators, mayors and a non-voting member of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on the same day mainland Americans pick a new president. But an underlining issue here is the seemingly never-ending debate over the island's 36-year-old commonwealth relationship with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>'s three main political parties _ distinguished from each other primarily by their support for commonwealth, statehood or independence _ all are seeking changes in what some of them see as the island's semicolonial status. The outcome of elections here Nov. 8 is likely to hinge more on personalities and issues such as unemployment than on <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>'s political status, analysts say But both incumbent governor, <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Colon </PERSON>, the commonwealth candidate, and his statehood rival, Mayor <PERSON> Baltasar </PERSON> <PERSON> Corrada </PERSON> <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Rio </PERSON> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>, have pledged to hold a status referendum after the election. The issue has featured prominently in the campaign so far. It would be the first such referendum since 1967, when 60 percent of the voters favored a continuation of the commonwealth arrangement, 39 percent statehood and 1 percent independence. <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, an island of 3.3 million mostly Spanish-speaking people 1,000 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, has flown the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flag since 1898, when <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> ceded it to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> at the end of the Spanish-American War. The modern-day commonwealth arrangement, which went into effect in July 1952, gives <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> roughly as much control over its own affairs as any of the 50 states. Puerto Ricans are <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens, but they pay no <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> taxes and can not vote for president. Nevertheless, they are eligible for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military service and Social Security and welfare benefits. <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> receives substantial <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid _ $ 6.5 billion this year alone _ and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies, taking advantage of tax exemptions, have given the island one of the strongest economies in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. In return, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> uses <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> as a strategic base for naval operations and an important market for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goods. `` The reality of the relationship, as it is now,'' pro-commonwealth commentator <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Maldonado </PERSON> wrote in the English-language <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Juan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION>, `` is enormously beneficial to <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. Despite monumental efforts of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to cut domestic spending to reduce the gigantic federal deficit, the flow of funds to the island has continued to grow.'' Yet, there is dissatisfaction on all sides. <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> supporters want more say in running the island; statehooders complain of being treated as second-class citizens; and the independence movement fervently _ at times violently _ seeks undiluted Puerto Rican sovereignty. <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Colon </PERSON>, 51, who is seeking his third four-year term, favors continued commonwealth status but wants <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to relinquish control over immigration, foreign trade and certain environmental and labor matters. His Popular <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has announced plans for a referendum sometime after the election seeking `` maximum autonomy'' for <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. But the party has not specified what the term means. <PERSON> Corrada </PERSON> <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Rio </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which wants <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> to become the 51st <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> state, says its referendum would ask voters whether <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> should begin negotiations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on statehood. If approved, the referendum would be followed by a second vote on any negotiated formula. The tiny <ORGANIZATION> Independence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which has n't won more than 6 percent of the vote in 20 years, proposes an election of a multiparty assembly to resolve the sovereignty question and negotiate a solution with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Regardless of the outcome, the election is unlikely to resolve the status issue. The statehood party has twice held the governor's office since it was founded in 1967, but has made no effort to achieve statehood while in power <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Colon </PERSON>, who has stressed his administration's economic record rather than the status issue, is favored to win, but it could be close. An opinion poll of 600 registered voters carried out for <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>'s Channel 2 television station in July put the incumbent governor 5 points ahead of <ORGANIZATION> Corrada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> del </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rio </ORGANIZATION> _ 45 percent to 40 percent _ with 4 percent backing the <ORGANIZATION> Independence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Ruben </PERSON> <PERSON> Berrios </PERSON> and the rest undecided. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.3 percent.

 Five-year-old <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> was lucky to survive a fire that destroyed the small apartment where he lived with his mother and two sisters. And he was fortunate to receive prompt, expert care to treat second - and third-degree burns over most of his face, his hands and chest, and part of his arms and head But <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON>, featured recently in a <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION> article looking at the tragic ramifications of living in poverty, is still very much in need. His face was pitifully disfigured by the flames, and he has not regained full movement of his hands. He and his 2-year-old sister, <PERSON> Shakeriay </PERSON>, who was not as seriously injured, spent a month at a Shriners' burn institute in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, after the December incident in this rural <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> suburb, just a few miles down the road from <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION>. The Newsweek story last month prompted offers of assistance from around the country, some for medical care and reconstructive surgery. A volunteer organization in <LOCATION> Apopka </LOCATION> has set up a fund-raising account for the <ORGANIZATION> Neals </ORGANIZATION>. A 6-year-old girl from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> sent <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION> a letter containing two $ 1 bills and two nickels with a note saying: `` Would you please give this to <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON>?'' The fire started after the children's mother, <PERSON> Audrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Neal </PERSON>, stepped out briefly to a neighboring apartment, leaving <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shakeriay </PERSON> in the living room. One of them evidently played with a cigarette lighter, and fire quickly engulfed the small apartment. Would-be rescuers found one of the doors to the apartment boarded up; they could not get the knob on the other door to work. Hearing the children's screams and frantic, fruitless efforts to open the front door, Ms. <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> and neighbors finally broke through the door, fought the flames and carried the children out just as firefighters arrived. Rescue workers administered emergency medical treatment and rushed them to an <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> hospital. A day after the blaze, <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> and his sister were flown in separate Learjet ambulances _ complete with a doctor, nurse and medical technician in each plane _ from <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> to the Shrine facility in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>. After their month's stay, <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> has continued to get outpatient care two or three times a month. All of this expensive, sophisticated treatment has been provided free by the Shriners under their generous programs for needy burned and crippled children around the country. Still, until <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> gets older, there is little doctors can do about his scarred and pitted face. `` Much of the reconstructive surgery has to wait until bone growth stops, probably around the age of 16,'' says <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, children's director of the <ORGANIZATION> Bahia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shrine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, who arranged for the <ORGANIZATION> Neals </ORGANIZATION>' treatment, transportation and continuing visits to the <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> facility. `` But we're prepared to help him as long as he needs it, up to the age of 21,'' says <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>. While <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON>'s continuing medical treatment for his physical injuries is ensured, there is some worry about his other, not-so-obvious problems and needs: the mental anguish, which is difficult to determine in a young child; his education, and the home care necessary before plastic surgery. He now wears a plastic face mask, which <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> says puts pressure on facial scar tissue to make it grow sideways to decrease its thickness. Because of his facial disfigurement, his mother is keeping him out of school and hopes to get him on a program that provides a visiting teacher for homebound students. So while other kids his age are starting school, <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> is spending hours in front of a TV or playing and squabbling with his two sisters and four cousins in the two-bedroom apartment where they now live. <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON>'s mother and her three children moved in with her sister <PERSON> Shawana </PERSON> and her four kids after the fire. `` The basic problem is that they are so poor they have no resources for anything,'' says social activist <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> about the <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> family. `` For one thing, here are seven children and two adults living in a tiny apartment. And now the landlord has given them an eviction notice.'' Ms. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, director of a volunteer organization known as SMILE, for Single Mothers In a Learning Experience, said <PERSON> Audrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Neal </PERSON>'s family would like to move out but ca n't afford to do so `` <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON>'s mother gets less than $ 350 a month in AFDC,'' the state's Aid to Families with Dependent Children, Ms. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said, whereas she'd need an annual income of $ 15,000 to qualify under a federally subsidized low-income housing program. Ms. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> set up the fund-raising account for the <ORGANIZATION> Neals </ORGANIZATION> to help them with housing, and home health care and education for <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON>. Meanwhile, Winter Park attorney <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Troutman </PERSON>, one of the founders of a legal-aid office for the poor in the <LOCATION> Apopka </LOCATION> area, said he was looking into the possibility of a liability lawsuit over the allegedly defective doorknob in the Neal apartment. `` As I understand it, the kiddies were trying their best to open the door during the fire but the doorknob would n't work,'' he said. `` We're looking into it.'' The <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> case is just one example of how people tend to overlook those in need until disaster strikes, Ms. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said, adding that articles like the one in Newsweek just scratch the surface of the problem. `` I hope we realize poverty is all around us,'' she said, `` that it's not always something hidden behind the scenes.''

<TEXT>
 Former President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> is rallying other nations' heads of state and health officials to eradicate a debilitating disease that infects 10 million people and disrupts agriculture in the Third World. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> has also persuaded the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> to target guinea worm disease, which sometimes has fatal complications, as the second disease _ after smallpox _ that the agency seeks to wipe out worldwide. He became concerned about the readily preventable disease through a famine relief program sponsored by Global 2000, a public health foundation headquartered at the <ORGANIZATION> Carter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presidential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. The program, whose primary goal is to improve yield for farmers' crops, found that agriculture in many remote areas was hampered because the cyclical worm disease strikes so many people in the spring, sickening them at planting season The disease itself is sickening to describe. In spring, infected people find the worm _ a yard-long, stringlike creature _ painfully emerging from boils that form in soft tissue between the toes or elsewhere on the body, having completed its growth cycle inside its human host. It enters the body through contaminated water. Seeing the ailment's devastation is `` heartrending,'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from his home in Plains. `` And just to realize that, with a simple education program and very simple prevention techiques, this affliction could be eliminated forever.'' Last spring, he and his wife, <PERSON> Rosalynn </PERSON>, visited heavily infected villages in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> nation of <LOCATION> Ghana </LOCATION>. `` The first village we went to had a population of 500 and they had 213 people stretched out on the ground under the kasha trees for us just to see and to meet,'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said. `` When we talked to the village elders and chiefs, they did n't have any idea what caused guinea worm They thought it might come from the praying mantis or from drinking the blood of goats or from some superstition like the confluence of the planets or that it was a punishment of the gods to test their endurance,'' he said. `` They did n't have any idea it came from drinking filthy water. Then we went down to look at the water hole that was their only source of drinking water. It was covered with scum and the people had to wade out I'd say at least knee deep before they could get a bucket full of water,'' he said. Some of the waders were infected and entered the water to ease their pain. When the emerging guinea worm comes in contact with water, it spews out its larvae which are then eaten by a microscopic animal called a cyclops. Villagers drink the water contaminated with cyclops and the cyclops die in their bodies, leaving behind the larvae to grow into worms. Infections caused when the worm dies inside the body can be fatal, though that is rare, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said. In the first worm eradication program undertaken by Global 2000, in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, foundation workers developed inexpensive techniques for breaking the creature's 12-month life cycle. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said the infestations can be prevented by replacing water holes with deep wells, `` but that costs $ 700 or $ 800 and we do n't have $ 700 or $ 800 for every village in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Other preventive measures include keeping people out of the water holes or having all villagers strain their water for a full year. But widespread illiteracy makes it difficult to educate the people at risk. Still, with the support and participation of the Pakistani government, Global 2000's eradication program is going so well that <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> predicted the disease would be eliminated there by 1990. Full-scale programs have started in <LOCATION> Ghana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION> in the last year and a new program is about to begin in <LOCATION> Uganda </LOCATION>. `` One of the things that I can contribute as a former president is to go not to an assistant minister of health, who may not have much influence or may not know anything about health to start with, but I go directly to the king or the president or the prime minister and ask him to bring his Cabinet members together,'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said. The news media attention his involvement receives also helps educate potential victims about the disease. `` It's a gratifying thing to see a village that was formerly devastated five or six months a year from guinea worm to emerge after a couple of years with no guinea worm and live a happy, prosperous and healthy life,'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said. `` In the process, to be frank about it, it puts <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> forward as an enlightened, concerned and peace-loving nation.''

<HEAD>Bush, Dukakis Say They'd Be Accessible Presidents</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> have issued matching promises of accessibility to the White House press, but neither was saying how often he would hold formal presidential news conferences. The rival presidential nominees made their statements on news and information policies in written responses to inquiries by the <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Managing Editors Association. Their replies were made public as <ORGANIZATION> APME </ORGANIZATION> officers and committee chairmen met in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Monday. `` I hope words like ` accessible,' ` candid,' ` honest' and ` fair' will be adjectives used to describe my relationship with the media by historians,'' Republican <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said `` It certainly is what I will strive for during my tenure as president.'' The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has come under frequent criticism for limiting access to information. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> renewed that criticism. The Democratic nominee prefaced his comments on his plans with a charge that `` the Reagan-Bush administration has waged an assault on the Freedom of Information Act with every weapon in its arsenal.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he has a proven record of accessibility to reporters, and would continue on that course as president. `` Throughout my public career I've believed in a free press and my record shows I've practiced that belief,'' he said. `` As president, I would hope to continue this pattern of accessibility to the White House press corps, giving them and me the opportunity to utilize our First Amendment freedoms. A questionnaire prepared for the FOI committee was given to both candidates. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> responded directly, answering each of the questions. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> replied by issuing a two-part position paper, with one section on the freedom of information law and a second on his press relations. Here is a partial transcript of their replies:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>GEORGE BUSH</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Q. As president, what sort of tone would you set regarding openness in government, access to government information and freedom of information? A. Within the limits of national security, government should be open to scrutiny by the media and the public. Ours is a democracy where goverment must be accountable to the people. The information-gathering process, from a news conference to the Freedom of Information Act, is vital and essential to our system of democracy. Q. What kind of relationship do you think you've had with the media during your public career? How would you seek to improve it, if at all? A. I think I have had a good relationship with the media. As president, I hope that I will be able to spend more time talking with smaller groups of reporters. I enjoy a good give and take, and that kind of format allows me to get to know reporters a little better and them to know me. Not only will this benefit reporters but, more importantly, such free exchange will ultimately benefit the general public as well. Q. Throughout history, presidents have had a variety of relationships with the media. Are there any styles you would emulate? Are there any you would avoid? When it comes time to write the history of your relations with the media, what will it say? A. With the media, the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> or the public, it would be a mistake to attempt to be something or someone you're not. So, warts and all, what you see is what you'll get. I hope words like `` accessible,'' `` candid,'' `` honest'' and `` fair'' will be adjectives used to describe my relationship with the media by historians. It certainly is what I will strive for during my tenure as president. ... Q. How frequently would you meet with reporters? How would you conduct press conferences? How often would you hold press conferences? Would you make any changes in the way President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has done his press conferences? A. There are a number of ways to communicate with both the media and the public. Press conferences are one important way and they would certainly be central to my effort to ensure accessibility in my administration. One-on-one and group interviews, satellite interviews with regional media, national televised addresses are other examples of methods that a president can and should use to provide the media with opportunities to discuss administration policies and programs. My goal would be to get the right `` mix'' of all of the options available to guarantee an open administration. Realistically, you ca n't put a number on any of the working parts of an open approach to accessibility, but you can make and keep a commitment to the goal itself. Q. More specifically, what message will you send to your executive agencies regarding Freedom of Information requests? A. My message will be simple: obey the law. ... Q. Here's a chance to offer some contructive criticism. What things would you most like to change about the news media? What should the nation's media do differently to better serve the public interest? A. Accuracy and fairness are the name of the game. The media goes to great lengths to be accurate. It needs to go to the same lengths to be fair. While it is often necessary to use unnamed sources in gathering information for a story, it puts the validity of a story at a disadvantage. I hope the news media would rely as little as possible on this approach to information gathering and reporting.

 Q. What sort of individual do you see putting in the job of White House spokesperson? How much access would the spokesman have to administration thinking and information? Do you condone <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON>' practice of manufacturing quotes? A. The job of White House press secretary is one of the toughest in any administration and a number of qualities are important. A press secretary must be honest, ethical, steady, candid with both the media and the president and experienced, with an understanding of the media and its needs. A sense of humor does n't hurt either. If access is important to reporters, it is absolutely vital to a press secretary. ... I understand that to function effectively a press secretary must have a first-hand knowledge of a President's policies and positions ... Finally, on the third question: no. Q. How much access do you believe reporters ought to have to the White House staff? How free would your staff be to talk on the record to reporters? A. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> Administration will be an open one. That does n't mean every staff member will be authorized to serve as an administration spokesman or interpreter of events and policies The best interests of the government, media and public are n't observed by the confusion and misinformation that usually results from that kind of policy. Not in every instance but in most, if something ca n't be said on the record, it's probably better left unsaid. ... Q. What would be your policy on allowing media coverage of military actions -LRB- a la <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> -RRB-? Do you support the pool approach worked out and used in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> exercises, or do you believe reporters and photographers ought to have even freer access to military operations? A. Certainly, the public has a right to know the details of military operations in an appropriate time frame and in a way that does not risk national security. The current relationship between the military and the press is workable and I support it. But that safety of the troops and the success of the mission must be paramount, and I will risk neither.

 Freedom of Information: For the past eight years, the Reagan-Bush administration has waged an assault on the Freedom of Information Act -LRB- FOIA -RRB- with every weapon in its arsenal _ executive orders, budget cuts, fee guidelines and legislative proposals. Their objective is clear: to gut a statute whose fundamental premise is that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizens have the right to know about the activities of their own government. The current administration claims that complying with the <ORGANIZATION> FOIA </ORGANIZATION> is too time-consuming, too expensive and too bothersome. These are excuses for government secrecy. And they could serve as a cloak for incompetence, mismanagement, illegality or corruption. ... As president, I will implement the <ORGANIZATION> FOIA </ORGANIZATION> in the spirit which <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> intended. From <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> to Watergate to Iran-Contra, we Americans have learned what happens when government operates in secrecy, accountable to no one. A <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> administration will treat requesters of information as clients, not as burdens. For only in an atmosphere of the fullest possible disclosure can the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people retain confidence in their government. Relations with the press: Throughout my public career I've believed in a free press and my record shows I've practiced that belief As governor for nearly 10 years, I have been accessible to <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> reporters several times a week. I enjoy the spirited give and take of news conferences and the vigorous exchange of an interview. More important, I understand and appreciate the role of the news media in a free society as laid out two centuries ago in the Bill of Rights to the Constitution. As president, I would hope to continue this pattern of accessibility to the White House press corps, giving them and me the opportunity to utilize our First Amendment freedoms.

<HEAD>Analysts See Dividend Growth as a Bright Spot in Dull Market</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also on financial wires.</NOTE>

 Investors may be dissatisfied with the progress of stock prices lately, but they should be pleased with rising dividends. That's the case being argued these days by analysts who argue that the `` boring'' stock market of 1988 has actually produced more generous rewards than its notices would suggest. When <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Poor </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> estimated recently that corporations might increase their dividends by as much as 10 percent this year, little loud cheering was heard on Wall Street. `` Dividends provide half the total return earned by common stocks historically, yet Wall Street traditionally ignores them,'' observed <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuper </PERSON>, executive vice president at the <ORGANIZATION> Centre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Square </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. `` But watch out, Wall Street. Dividends and, more particularly, dividend growth are likely to take a front seat with investors as the 5 - to 6-percent growth rate of the last five years doubles to 10 - to 12-percent over the next few years It is n't hard to figure out why dividends did n't command as much attention as capital gains when the typical investor thought about the stock market in recent years. If you tried to talk about dividends in the heady 1982-87 bull market, you most likely would have been laughed out of the room. And in the subsequent crash last fall, the furthest thing from anybody's mind was a quarterly dividend check. In any financial season, most professional money managers and brokers are n't paid by their clients to generate dividends. However, analysts who have delved into the subject say that to dismiss dividends as irrelevant misses the point. `` We have always considered yield to be a bedrock indicator of value,'' asserts <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` It is a hard number, unlike earnings or book value, which may exist only in the mind of an accountant. `` Declaring a dividend involves a cash payment. It is not a decision that is taken lightly.'' The dividend bulls base their optimism on several factors, starting with the strong trend in corporate earnings that helps give boards of directors the option of voting dividend increases. Furthermore, says <PERSON> Kuper </PERSON> at Centre Square, companies recently have been paying out less than 40 percent of their earnings as dividends, which is close to a historic low. A normal rate, he says, is more like 50 percent. The Tax Reform Act of 1986, he adds, provided a spur to dividends since it eliminated the special tax treatment of long-term capital gains. That means that dividends now have an equal value with capital gains for taxpaying investors. Based on his estimates for 1989, <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON> figures the aggregate yield on the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's composite index of 500 stocks projects to 4.1 percent. `` Contrast that with the mere 2.6 percent available at the market top last year,'' he says. `` These numbers are unlikely to make anyone's adrenaline flow,'' he acknowledges. `` Stocks are bought for appreciation, not yield. `` But we are more interested in value than pizzazz at this stage, and 4.1 percent is a comfortable number.'' For the first two-thirds of 1988, <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON> adds, the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P 500 was up about 7 percent. `` Since the yield is about 4 percent, total return is 11 percent. `` This compares well with the 10 percent -LRB- annual -RRB- long-term return on stocks. Boring might not be so bad.''

 For <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, who aspires to be a character actor but finds himself in a leading man's body, <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Tattinger </PERSON> might just be the perfect role. <PERSON> Nick </PERSON>, the hero of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s new `` Tattinger's,'' is a two-fisted, up-from-the-streets entrepreneur who has become one of the swells by virtue of owning an exclusive <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> restaurant. He's a good-looking, charming guy, but he's also quite a character. The show, filmed on location in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, premieres Oct. 26. Over lunch at a midtown <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> restaurant, <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, 41, said that until recently he would not have been the man for the part. In fact, he said, unbeknownst to him, he was rejected for it when the show's co-creator, <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Paltrow </PERSON>, was first kicking around the idea a few years ago. `` Evidently at the time, I had no idea, my name came up, and he said, ` No, he's too young and he's not right for it, he's not what we're looking for at all,''' <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> said. But more recently, after attending a cocktail party at the home of his friend <PERSON> Blythe </PERSON> <PERSON> Danner </PERSON>, who happens to be <LOCATION> Paltrow </LOCATION>'s wife, <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> got a call from <LOCATION> Paltrow </LOCATION>. `` He said, ` I'm sending you this script because my wife thinks that you can play the central character.' <PERSON> Blythe </PERSON> had not said a word to me. ... What <PERSON> Blythe </PERSON> had, I guess, said to him was, ` He's a little older and he's a little rougher around the edges, and I think he'd be interested in playing this part.' I read it and immediately knew.'' <PERSON> Danner </PERSON> co-stars in the series as <PERSON> Nick </PERSON>'s socialite ex-wife, <PERSON> Hillary </PERSON>. `` I've done a few things I'm proud of _ not enough _ but I've done a few things I'm proud of,'' said <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, `` and the common denominator of all of them is that when I read the script, it's like I can visualize the character, ... but I do n't get all involved in the image of what the character And it's usually a character part. <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> is really a character part. It wo n't look like that to a lot of people because I'm playing it, and people have me tagged.'' To illustrate the kind of guy <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> is, <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> opens a script and turns to a scene between <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> and <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> -RRB-, <PERSON> Hillary </PERSON>'s lover. <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> says <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> is a better father than he is, a good person. `` <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> does n't see himself as a very good person,'' <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> said, `` and he's not in a lot of ways. <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> says, ` That's not enough.' <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> says, ` It's got ta be.' Norm says, ` Oh, sure, you can say that looking like you do, but what about the rest of us with thinning hair and baggy eyes?' <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> says, ` Everybody thinks my life is so fabulous. Let me tell you something, being back in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, surrounded by the facts ... all I see is what I lost, what I threw away. Getting it back in tiny pieces here and there stinks.' Then he says, ` You hear violins?' `` That's the way he feels about his life. It's like he's really come to a crisis point in this life. It's really fun to play someone who does n't have all the answers.'' <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, who was born in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> but grew up in and around <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, has always been pegged as a leading-man type. He works often on the stage and has just written his first play. His film credits can almost be divided down the line between small parts in good pictures, such as `` All the President's Men'' and `` Between the Lines,'' and bigger parts in sillier, if commercially successful movies like `` Star Trek: The Motion Picture'' and `` <PERSON> Brewster </PERSON>'s Millions.'' He is a frequent presence in TV movies and miniseries and got a 1987 Emmy nomination for his supporting role as <PERSON> Ann-Margret </PERSON>'s cad husband in `` The Two Mrs. <PERSON> Grenvilles </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, occasionally brushing back his longish blond hair, says when he considers it objectively, he has to conclude that his looks have helped as much as hurt his career. `` I think everybody, however they look, they take their looks for granted, so it's not news to me if people see me that way,'' he said. `` And so what I remember as an actor is the number of times people have said to me, literally, ` Oh, you gave the best reading, we thought yours was the best reading, but we need somebody who's not a leading-man type for this part We need somebody with more character.' That's part of the reason it's so much fun to play this part, because you need a little of both to play <PERSON> Nick </PERSON>.''

<HEAD>`Animal Spirits' May Move the Stock Market</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: John Cunniff is on vacation.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 As the first anniversary of the stock market crash approaches, some economists are advancing a new explanation for the $ 500 billion jolt: animal spirits. `` Animal spirits'' is a shorthand phrase for emotion, unreason and other qualities that _ to be fair to animals _ are really more typical of human beings than the lower beasts. Most people have figured all along that emotion affects the stock market, but for economists to say the same thing amounts to a major shift. Economists were indoctrinated to believe that financial markets adjust quickly and smoothly to changes in the rational expectations of investors. At any given moment, in other words, stock prices reflect the perfect collective wisdom of millions of investors. There were some doubts about the so-called efficient markets theory even before Black Monday. There were a lot afterward. After all, nothing happened in the real world on Oct. 19 to reduce the true value of corporate <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> by nearly a quarter, which is how much stocks fell that day. That's where animal spirits come in. Or `` fads,'' or `` secular bubbles,'' depending on which economist is coining slogans. Evidence has accumulated that the Oct. 19 stock crash was in large part the result of portfolio insurance, a computerized strategy that triggers avalanches by dumping more and more stocks the further they fall. Emotion played a small part that day because many of the supposedly emotional small investors either sat tight or could n't get their sell orders through Still, animal spirits and crowd psychology help explain why investors bid stocks up so unreasonably high in the first place, setting themselves up for a fall. Stock prices are supposed to go up when the economy is doing well, reflecting the outlook for rising corporate profits. But the relation is so haphazard that one economist has even been able to conclude the opposite: that stocks and bonds do best when the economy is doing worst. `` Stock market rallies start in the middle of recessions,'' said <PERSON> Aubrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaffuto </PERSON>, an economist at <ORGANIZATION> IBJ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schroder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Zaffuto </PERSON> theorizes that when the economy slows down, there is unused money sloshing around that is parked in financial assets, driving up their value The bad-is-good view is disputed by most economists, but the fact that it even exists shows the weakness of the correlation between stocks and the real world. `` I do n't want to go so far as to say there's no connection between the stock market and the economy. But what that -LRB- connection -RRB- is remains in dispute,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, an economist at <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION> is more sympathetic to the efficient markets theorists than some of his colleagues, such as <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Shiller </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Mankiw </PERSON>, who lean toward the faddist school. But he said, `` To tell you the truth, I'm a little puzzled. ... For a while, academics at least believed you could explain all movements in the stock market by expectations of future dividends, perhaps adjusted a bit for real interest rates. `` People have become more humble. That's progress of a kind, but it's not much progress toward a solution.''

<HEAD>HDTV Ruling May Give U.S. Chance To Re-enter Consumer Electronics</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID THURBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 New standards set by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government for a future high-quality television system may give the American electronics industry a chance to catch up with Japanese and European makers, but the result could be three separate world TV broadcast standards, officials and analysts say. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has lagged behind <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in development of high-definition television _ a new wide-screen TV system with breathtakingly detailed pictures and high-quality sound that represents the biggest change in television since color broadcasting. On Sept. 1, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> set initial standards for future HDTV broadcasts in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that are incompatible with those developed in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. This past week in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, D-Mass., asked electronics industry trade groups to submit reports to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> by January outlining steps the government could take to ensure <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> involvement in high-definition TV `` This is the last moment of opportunity for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to remain a major party in the world consumer electronics industry,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>, representative in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> of the two largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> electronics trade organizations. In <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, broadcasts using an HDTV system developed by the <ORGANIZATION> NHK </ORGANIZATION> public television network are scheduled to begin in two years, while <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> companies are expected to launch sales of equipment for a separate European HDTV system in 1992, officials say. In both regions, HDTV broadcasts will be beamed direct from satellites to small receiving dishes in viewers' homes. The outcome of the battle among HDTV systems for the world's living rooms, analysts say, could help determine what country will dominate the global electronics industry At stake are potential HDTV sales estimated by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> NHK </ORGANIZATION> at $ 80 billion by 1995. But the actual cost could be much greater if companies _ and countries _ miss out on HDTV production, as most <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> electronics makers have with videocassette recorders, compact disk players and other consumer products. `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturing industry is worried that <ORGANIZATION> HDTV </ORGANIZATION> will open an enormous new market to Japanese companies,'' <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> said. `` It's not just a matter of television, but also medical and military imaging, publishing, and computer digital image-processing equipment It's all the same technology.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is about six years behind <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in the commercialization of HDTV technology, <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> says, and the new preliminary <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> standards will provide it with `` an extra one year, maximum'' to catch up. Incompatibility with Japanese and European standards means manufacturers have to design separate equipment for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market. In <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, manufacturers were able to develop their HDTV system in about two years. But unlike those in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> companies have remained strong in consumer electronics. HDTV development began in the 1960s, when engineers at <ORGANIZATION> NHK </ORGANIZATION> started developing a state-of-the-art system they hoped would unify the world's TV systems into a single standard. But at international talks on adopting the <ORGANIZATION> NHK </ORGANIZATION> system as a world standard in 1986, the Europeans opposed the Japanese HDTV broadcast standard because of its incompatibility with current television equipment. That lack of compatibility would force consumers and broadcasters to replace their current equipment _ estimated to be worth about $ 100 billion in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, according to a recent <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> report _ if they want to receive HDTV broadcasts. According to the new FCC standards, future <ORGANIZATION> HDTV </ORGANIZATION> broadcasts in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must use current TV channels and be viewable on present televisions. However, to see the improved picture quality, consumers would need to buy new receivers, just as color TV sets are needed now to see broadcasts in color, while old black-and-white televisions can receive the same broadcasts in monochrome. <ORGANIZATION> NHK </ORGANIZATION> officials say they decided to give up compatibility with current TV equipment because of the technical limitations of present systems, developed decades ago. Since the 1986 meeting, European companies have developed a separate <ORGANIZATION> HDTV </ORGANIZATION> system that is viewable _ although with unenhanced picture quality _ on current European televisions, but not on those in other parts of the world. The new FCC standards are `` a good decision,'' said <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Bourene </PERSON>, attache for science and technology at the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>'s mission in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. `` It's a chance for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to stimulate its own industry.'' But <PERSON> Bourene </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision `` almost definitely'' means there will be three separate world HDTV broadcast standards. `` It's better if we keep our own -LRB- <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> -RRB- system because it's a small protection against the Japanese industry Even if the Japanese develop equipment for the European market very quickly, they will need a license, and it's not clear that they can get it. So it may be possible -LRB- for <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> makers -RRB- to keep hold of the European market,'' he said.

 Japanese industry officials say they already have perfected technologies that will meet the FCC standards. `` The technology already exists, and Japanese companies should be able to begin production of equipment without much trouble,'' said <PERSON> Takeo </PERSON> <PERSON> Kumasaka </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s Hi-Vision Center, an organization created in part by the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> to encourage development of Japanese HDTV. `` Where were they -LRB- critics of the Japanese system -RRB- while we were spending more than $ 50 million to develop equipment for HDTV?'' asked a official at <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` If they had suggestions, why did n't they make them earlier?'' But while debate continues on the details of a final <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> HDTV broadcast standard, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> NHK </ORGANIZATION> system may become a studio and production standard, at least in some applications. Already, film makers in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> are using the <ORGANIZATION> NHK </ORGANIZATION> system to produce movies because of its advantages over film in speed, ease of editing and adaptibility to special effects. Soon, Japanese HDTV videocassette recorders and pre-recorded tapes are likely to be available, and cable broadcasts may follow. `` Studio standards have nothing to do with the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION>, so the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> ruling wo n't affect negotiations on a possible world production standard for HDTV,'' <ORGANIZATION> NHK </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Takehiko </PERSON> <PERSON> Motohashi </PERSON> said. `` Therefore, the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> ruling wo n't necessarily affect the exchange -LRB- between countries -RRB- of HDTV television programs.'' In other business and economic news this past week: _ The <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, in a long-awaited move, filed extensive civil insider-trading, fraud and stock manipulation charges against the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, the head of its junk bond trading unit, and others All defendants denied the charges, which stemmed from an investigation tied to convicted stock speculator <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Bond Rally Helps Municipal Market Pick Up Steam</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 After a sleepy August that saw record low sales volume, the municipal bond market has picked up steam. Trading in bonds issued by state and local governments normally revives with the coming of autumn after the summer doldrums. But the `` muni'' market also is getting a lift from the recent robust rally in bond prices in general, touched off Sept. 2 by government economic reports signaling a slowdown in the economy and suggesting an easing of inflation. The bond rally has again lured to municipals many investors who were soured on the stock market by last October's crash. As bond prices have risen, they have pushed interest rates lower. The yield on highly-rated municipal issues is now averaging around 7.98 percent, down from 8.10 percent on Sept. 1, the day before the economic reports were released. If municipal yields keep falling, to a target level of around 7.40 percent to 7.50 percent, a flood of new issues could be brought to market, some analysts believe. `` It's a return to more traditional pulses,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Fish </PERSON>, a senior vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Donaldson </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lufkin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Jenrette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The pickup in activity is a welcome relief to market players after the dog days of August, when sales of long-term municipal bonds nationwide dropped to around $ 5.51 billion _ the lowest monthly total in 2 -LCB- years. Muni sales had n't been that skimpy since February 1986, when only $ 3.18 billion of the bonds changed hands. Sales normally run around $ 8 billion a month. The September revival is reflected in the volume of new munis scheduled to hit the market. This coming week, for example, several big issues are planned: from <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> -LRB- $ 175 million -RRB-, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> -LRB- $ 155 million -RRB-, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> State -LRB- $ 50 million -RRB-, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- $ 450 million -RRB-, <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, -LRB- $ 50 million -RRB- and the <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sewer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- $ 48 million -RRB-. But in addition to scheduled issues, there's a `` shadow calendar'' of new munis that's also expected to swell this month. In those instances, the state or local entity issuing the bonds waits for interest rates to fall or to see how other muni issues are received by the market. If conditions are right, the issuers emerge from the shadows. `` We then tend to have a mini-rush to market,'' said <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> Attermann </PERSON>, vice president and municipal research director of <ORGANIZATION> Kidder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co. Especially sensitive to interest-rate declines are negotiated municipal issues, in which the issuer and an underwriter negotiate with each other and reach agreement on the terms of the issue. They are more hidden from the market than competitive issues, where the issuer accepts bids from several underwriters seeking to finance the issue. Because negotiated issues are more confidential, their sponsors can easily keep them hidden on the `` shadow calendar'' until they feel the time is right. Around 60 percent to 70 percent of all municipal issues are negotiated, according to analysts. This month, `` negotiated issues could come out of the woodwork,'' said Fish of <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Lufkin </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Trade Report Will Have Wall Street Seeing Double</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 When Wall Street has its monthly confrontation with the government's trade statistics next Wednesday, a new wild card will be added to the game. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is adopting a new format for reporting the figures, and analysts say it may create more than the usual confusion in the financial markets. Along with a number comparable to those of past months, the department will calculate the nation's trade deficit excluding the cost of freight and insurance for imports. This so-called Customs value method of figuring the balance between imports and exports typically produces a deficit total about $ 1.5 billion lower than otherwise, analysts note. Previously, the Customs value trade balance had been reported at least two days later than the original, unadjusted figure, and commanded almost no attention from stock and bond investors. Now, says <PERSON> Maury </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, economist at <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION>, `` it is likely that administration spokespersons will be emphasizing the lower Customs value deficit.'' As <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> asserted, `` the July merchandise trade deficit will be about $ 1.5 billion lower than it otherwise would be. `` But this is a cosmetic improvement only. The current-account deficit, and therefore the dollar-financing requirement of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, will not be affected one iota.'' Some say that kind of assessment is too harsh. After all, they say, the subject of the data is the `` merchandise'' trade deficit, and insurance and freight are not merchandise, but services instead. <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials have said that the change in procedure, which was mandated by the trade bill enacted in August, is intended to put proper emphasis on those numbers that most accurately depict the situation. Still, Wall Street analysts say, it may well introduce a new element of uncertainty to markets that are highly sensitive to economic statistics like the trade data. `` Two different numbers on the same day will initially generate some temporary confusion and possible cynicism about government tampering with statistics before elections,'' said <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>. Amid the uncertainty pervading Wall Street, the stock market was able to scratch out some modest gains in the past week, though they did not live up to hopes built up in a rally begun just before the Labor Day weekend. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 14.22 points to 2,068.81. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> composite index chimed in with a 1.18 advance to 150.84; the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> market value index rose 1.83 to 297.45; and the <ORGANIZATION> NASDAQ </ORGANIZATION> composite index for the over-the-counter market added 5.09 to 381.60. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> averaged 135.17 million shares a day, against 128.48 million the week before. When the trade figures are sorted out, what are they likely to show? Nothing worthy of any big fuss, a cynical observer might say, since like most monthly data they provide no reliable evidence of the kind of trend that would concern any savvy, long-term investor. That complaint aside, the data are not expected to provide much news to revive traders' flagging spirits. Says the <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Market </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Letter </ORGANIZATION> in its preview of the report, `` after improving on a fairly steady basis earlier in the year, the foreign trade deficit had a relapse in June, climbing to $ 12.5 billion from $ 9.8 billion in May. The deficit probably wo n't improve much in coming months. The comparable figure for July will probably come in around $ 10.5 billion, <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> analysts say.

<HEAD>SEC Move on Drexel Goes Beyond Wall Street</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

 After Black Monday, the last thing Wall Street needs is another crisis of confidence. But the government's massive fraud accusations against investment giant <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> threaten to rock the public's already shaky trust in the fairness of the stock market. By refocusing the 2-year-old insider trading investigation on a major securities firm, the charges leveled by the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> elevated the scandal well beyond the simple greed of individuals like <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>. In so doing, the government heightened public doubts about the venerable institutions that control the securities business and shape the market's role in the American economy. Although many investment professionals think the move against <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> by the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> reflects an aggressive government effort to make the markets fairer, others say that at least for now, the charges are likely to further erode ordinary Americans' confidence in stocks and other securities. That could mean less business for brokers, less long-term investing, more difficulty for companies trying to raise money to grow, rising unemployment, mounting debt and a fall in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s economic might, some strategists argue `` There's no question this comes at a bad time,'' said <PERSON> Perrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON>, a securities industry expert at <ORGANIZATION> Lipper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Analytical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` It probably lowers confidence as far as the average investor is concerned, below what their already-low confidence may be.'' Although Long and others said they believe the securities industry in general and <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> in particular will ultimately survive, `` the sad thing is, if Wall Street does n't prosper, it's highly unlikely the country will prosper There's a close tie-in all the way around, and it benefits both not to have our image tarnished. It's a sad situation.'' The staggering civil suit filed by the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> last Wednesday against <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> and key employees _ notably its high-yield, high-risk `` junk bond'' unit chief <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> _ accused them of a vast array of frauds ranging from insider trading to stock manipulation to client-cheating. The defendants denied the charges, vowed to vigorously fight them in court and predicted vindication. As outlined by the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> engaged in systematic, arrogant abuse of its position as a leading investment firm, calling into question why it is in business in the first place. `` I would say this particular news story or incident is n't helpful in terms of bringing the small investor back,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Gross </PERSON>, managing director of <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, which manages a $ 17 billion portfolio for large institutional clients such as pension funds `` The more headlines you see on trials about insider trading _ I'm not commenting on the veracity of this suit _ the more the individual investor subscribes to the theory that you ca n't win,'' <PERSON> Gross </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> action had been expected for months and both the stock and bond markets showed little outward reaction. But it raised the likelihood that the <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office will soon bring criminal charges, which would be far more serious and could possibly cripple <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s ability to do business. The firm's difficult position also recalls the demise of <ORGANIZATION> E.F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the once-mighty retail brokerage devastated by fraud charges that arose from a check-kiting scandal three years ago. A debilitated <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON> was sold to <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> last year. This analogy has n't been lost on <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>, which has undertaken an unprecedented television campaign for support, stressing what it calls the firm's role in raising money for projects ranging from day-care centers to middle-income housing. But the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> move and possible criminal charges may nullify the effect of that campaign. They also are bound to incite a spree of suits from investors who claim they lost money on stocks allegedly manipulated by <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> and other defendants. `` There are two levels of awareness in the marketplace _ you have the professionals close to the industry who were aware this was there, and when it happens, it's a non-event,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bachmann </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` Then there are the people who heard it along the way and were n't aware, and in that group, it's not a plus.'' Some say the combined effects of all the litigation and publicity already have made <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> a tainted household word, much in the same way that <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, the speculator-felon who led authorities to the investment firm, became synonymous with Wall Street insider trading a few years ago. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Markese </PERSON>, vice president and research director for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Individual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, said he believed the <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> story and other accounts of alleged securities fraud likely would help drive customers away from retail stockbrokers and into large mutual funds, which have greater diversity and strength. But ultimately, he said, the federal crackdown on <LOCATION> Wall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> excesses probably would help many investors regain some degree of assurance that the markets are n't totally rigged, regardless of whether <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> exonerates itself. `` The small investor is always at the bottom of the information ladder. That has always been true, and cases like this point up how tall that ladder is,'' <PERSON> Markese </PERSON> said. `` I think the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> is trying to make it a shorter and quicker information flow, so that's all good.''

 Concern about the worldwide oil glut continues to weigh heavy on the futures market. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the October contract for delivery of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Intermediate, the benchmark grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude, fell 30 cents a 42-gallon barrel Friday to $ 14.18. The contract had risen 32 cents on Thursday after falling sharply earlier in the week. Contracts for refined oil products traded on the exchange also declined. Wholesale unleaded gasoline for October delivery plunged 0.93 cent a gallon to 42.06 cents, after rising 0.40 cent the previous session. Analysts attributed the decline to the end of the traditional driving season on Labor Day. The October wholesale heating oil contract, which gained 0.24 cent Thursday, fell 0.90 cent to 40.97 a gallon. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Beutel </PERSON>, an energy analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Elders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said prices started out firm amid speculation that the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION>' price monitoring committee might hold an emergency meeting. But with those prospects unconfirmed, prices took a nosedive, he said. `` The sellers came out of the woodwork ...,'' <PERSON> Beutel </PERSON> said. The Saudi Arabian newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Al-Sharq </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bali </ORGANIZATION> quoted unnamed high-level Arab oil sources Friday as saying <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> called for a special meeting later this month of the price-monitoring committee to help stem the decline in oil prices. But the newspaper also said a moderate member of the five-member committee was opposed to the meeting. Crude prices on Tuesday and Wednesday hit their lowest point since Oct. 29, 1986, when they reached $ 13.73 per barrel. The following day the price leaped to $ 15.04 a barrel.

<HEAD>Wholesale Prices Climb, But Markets Unconcerned</HEAD>

 The government says wholesale prices rose 0.6 percent in August, but the rise was a slight 0.3 percent excluding food and energy, and traders took the report as good news on inflation. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Friday the August rise, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, was half the increase of July. Another drop in oil prices also helped the inflation picture. And gold prices plunged and bonds rose, a classic sign that investors were less concerned about inflation. Gold, which investors hold as a hedge against inflation, sank $ 7.25 a troy ounce to $ 421.25 an ounce in late <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trading, its lowest point since early 1987. Bond prices, which are hurt by inflation fears, finished higher after seesawing through a volatile trading session, pushing key interest rates below 9 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s closely watched 30-year bond rose 9-16 point, or about $ 5.60 for every $ 1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves inversely to its price and is often an indicator of interest rate trends, fell to 8.97 percent from 9.03 percent late Thursday. Meanwhile, stock prices took a zigzag path, winding up with a modest gain in continued sluggish trading. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 5.69 to 2,068.81. Crude oil futures plunged on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> amid rumors <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> had vetoed proposals for a special meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> pricing committee. On other exchanges, contracts for future delivery of precious metals, grains, soybeans, livestock and meat all finished moderately to sharply lower while stock-index futures advanced.
