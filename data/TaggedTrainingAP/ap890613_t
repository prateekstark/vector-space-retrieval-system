<TEXT>
 In a gesture of reconciliation more than four decades after the end of World War II, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has released the names of 1,500 German soldiers who died in its prisoner-of-war camps. The list was presented to the German <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> to coincide with the arrival Monday of Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. It was the first time the Soviets had provided a list of German soldiers still unaccounted for after the war, West German officials said. Thousands of German soldiers died in Soviet prisoner-of-war camps and many prisoners were not released until the early 1950s. German <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> officials applauded the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> action, saying it was a `` moving gesture of reconciliation and an important first step in clarifying the fate of these missing men.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> and another West German group, the Federation for the Preservation of German War Graves, said they hoped to be able to inform relatives of the soldiers on the list soon. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> said it hoped that additional lists of missing soldiers would follow. The <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> has also agreed allow greater access to several cemeteries in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> where German soldiers are buried. German <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Botho </PERSON> <PERSON> Prinz </PERSON> zu <PERSON> Sayn-Wittgenstein </PERSON> called the Soviet gesture a `` breakthrough in the humantarian relations'' between the two nations. The bitter legacy of World War II and the Nazi attack on the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has clouded West German-Soviet relations for decades. According to official estimates, more than 20 million Soviets were killed in the war and <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> armies destroyed vast areas of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Soviet prisoners of war were subjected to brutal treatment by the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> and thousands died in forced labor and concentration camps until the German defeat in 1945.

<TEXT>
 The countdown has begun at the Opera Bastille. Some 1,500 hard hats are working double shifts putting finishing touches on the gleaming glass and steel structure scheduled to open July 13 as the French mark the bicentennial of their revolution. French opera buffs hope the high-tech musical complex _ built on the square where revolutionaries stormed the Bastille prison on July 14, 1789 _ will finally put <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> on the international music map. For the moment, doubts remain. The new Opera had been leaderless since last January when <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> conductor <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Barenboim </PERSON> was fired because of what President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>'s representative said were his high fees and `` elitist views'' on opera. <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Berge </PERSON>, the head of the <ORGANIZATION> Yves </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Saint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laurent </ORGANIZATION> fashion empire and the man <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> appointed to manage the project in its final days, said <PERSON> Barenboim </PERSON>'s replacement would be someone who understood the president's wish to create a `` modern and popular opera'' accessible to the masses. Five months of speculation and uncertainty ended last month when that someone turned out to be <PERSON> Myung-Whung </PERSON> <PERSON> Chung </PERSON>, a 36-year-old Korean conductor known for his skills as a pianist. Soft-spoken and unemotional, the new music director said he would be a team player eager to work `` in harmony and unison'' with Opera Bastille administrators. Warning he would not get entangled in the political infighting that has beset the project from the start, he said, `` If there is a fight, and I'll say it publicly right now, I wo n't fight. I'll just leave.'' Although <PERSON> Berge </PERSON> declined to divulge <PERSON> Chung </PERSON>'s salary, he said his five-year contract requires the maestro be in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> for 27 weeks a year for a minimum of 30 performances, <PERSON> Chung </PERSON> also let it be known he has his own ideas on `` popular opera.'' `` Popular means the house is full and people are dying to get in,'' he said in an interview. `` I'd like to broaden the opera-going public and see more young people and students in the audience.'' Meanwhile, workers are busy getting ready for the inaugural concert, billed originally as the centerpiece of official bicentennial celebrations to be performed before <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and other luminaries. French conductor <PERSON> Georges </PERSON> <PERSON> Pretre </PERSON> will conduct the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> Opera Ballet Orchestra and Chorus, with a host of international celebrities performing selected arias from well-known French operas. The concert will be staged by <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> director <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, the longtime darling of the French avant-garde. The Opera-Bastille's first bona fide operatic production is scheduled for next February. Although <PERSON> Chung </PERSON> did not reveal the program, the real star of the show is sure to be the building itself. The new Opera is a hulking mass of polished granite, glass and stainless steel designed by Canadian architect <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Ott </PERSON>. Critics compare it to an ocean liner in dry dock, looming over the <LOCATION> Place </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> la </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bastille </LOCATION> in eastern <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. The prison was torn down during the revolution. A technical wonder, the Opera Bastille is everything the ornate, century-old <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> Opera is not. The Palais <PERSON> Garnier </PERSON> may be a landmark known worldwide for its baroque design and Chagall-decorated ceiling, but it has been inadequate for decades. The old Opera has a scant 1,600 seats with unobstructed views and virtually no backstage, which meant that sets had to be built elsewhere, dismantled, brought in and reconstructed. The cost was staggering, and so were ticket prices. Tickets to the new Opera Bastille are expected to cost a maximun of 250 francs -LRB- about $ 40 -RRB-, less than half their cost at the Palais <PERSON> Garnier </PERSON>, which from now on will be devoted to ballet. The Opera Bastille has 12 stages in all, including a main stage flagged by five stages and an adjoining rehearsal stage identical to the main stage, plus five identical stages one level below. All are fitted with freight elevators, electronically controlled and motorized wagons on conveyor tracks so that sets for an entire opera can be moved from rehearsal stages to the main stage within 10 minutes. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dittmann </PERSON>, the scenic director who drew up the technical specifications, calls the Opera Bastille `` practical, not sophisticated.'' `` Sophisticated means complicated, and this building is n't complicated,'' he said during a tour of the building `` It's very simple. It's a place where you have a lot of space. Here we do n't have the daily problem of where to put our decor in between performances. The main stage offers 4,300 square feet of space and is 66 feet high. It is equipped with 9 elevators, 72 traps and a movable orchestra pit that can be open or closed in two to three minutes. A bridge over the main and backstages allows stage hands to load the ceiling with carpets, curtains and other decor without monopolizing the stage. The ceiling is also designed for storage, thus economizing two hours a day when productions alternate. There is ample space for costumes, workshops and storage areas, connected directly to the main stage. The Opera Bastille is a musician's dream with rehearsal rooms galore _ three for the orchestra, two for ballet, two for the chorus, 16 studios for singers and 12 for musicians. While backstage areas are still dusty construction sites, the main hall itself is nearly ready. On a recent visit, workmen were busy polishing granite pillars, washing windows, waxing hardwood floors and installing cushions. Despite a glass ceiling and a cold color scheme in white, black and gray, the atmosphere is pleasant and intimate, aided, in part, to wooden walls and two tiers of graceful balconies reminiscent of Japanese pagodas. <PERSON> Dittmann </PERSON> says the hall's computer-analyzed acoustics are excellent. Even the hall's chairs have been designed with acoustics in mind: There are small holes which allow the sound to pass through when they are empty. A polystyrene joint under the building absorbs vibrations from the three metro lines that intersect under the Place de la Bastille. `` If that is n't enough, the subway cars themselves will be fitted with special rubber tires,'' he said.

 Take a population rejected by society for its misdeeds. Then look the other way when a killer virus takes hold and the afflicted complain about cruel treatment and deficient medical care. That's the impact of AIDS in prison. `` Prisoners are regarded as ... people who do n't matter. It's a double stigma for inmates with AIDS,'' said <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Fruedenberg </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> expert on AIDS counseling and education. The second story in a three-part AP Extra series, `` Medicine Behind Bars,'' addresses care and treatment of inmates with AIDS.

 <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, isolated with other female <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> prisoners carrying the AIDS virus, feared she would bleed to death in her cell. Stitches from routine uterine surgery had torn open, but nurses on three shifts failed to answer her pleas for help in November 1987, she said. `` They was afraid of the blood. They was afraid of catching the virus. They had a fear of the word AIDS,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, who waited 12 hours before she was taken to a hospital near <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION>. `` You're treated like an alien, like you had the plague,'' she said. `` I got sentenced for manslaughter. The judge could have just as well sentenced me to death row. It's like being punished for my crime and my diagnosis.'' Behind prison walls, AIDS is a crackling health issue. Some states isolate inmates who have the virus even if they have n't developed symptoms. Those in segregation consider it cruel confinement to a new death row. Prison officials defend it as a way to contain the virus and protect those infected from harm. While arguments can be made for segregation, nothing excuses the failure to provide medical care, inmates' advocates say. Yet prisons are n't equipped to treat the long-term debilitating illnesses wrought by AIDS. `` Those on the new death row are not getting appropriate medical attention. They are being condemned to waste away,'' said <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Schatz </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> AIDS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Project </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advocates </ORGANIZATION>. `` They are treated as if infection indicates they have done something wrong.'' `` AIDS has made the job of providing prison health care more difficult, more hazardous and more expensive,'' said <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> <PERSON> Prout </PERSON>, director of the internship program at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is most commonly transmitted during homosexual acts and the sharing of contaminated needles while injecting drugs, two behaviors common among prisoners. In the most recent count last October, 3,136 AIDS cases had been diagnosed among the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> prison population of more than 627,000, according to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>. AIDS in prison increased 60 percent last year, as against a 76 percent jump in the general population, which can pursue high-risk behaviors more freely. <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and five other states _ <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> _ segregate prisoners who carry the HIV virus that causes AIDS, whether or not they have the disease. Prisoners with full-blown AIDS are segregated in 20 other states, and 14 states test or will soon start testing all incoming inmates for the disease. Federal prisons randomly test 10 percent of incoming inmates and all those leaving the system. Those with AIDS or the virus are not isolated. Mandatory mass screening and segregation of all HIV-positive inmates is opposed by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION>, which sets voluntary standards for health care in prisons. It favors solutions such as education and changing behaviors that cause AIDS. <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> inmates who tested positive to the AIDS virus have charged in a class action lawsuit that they receive poor medical care and cruel treatment. The federal trial began in March. Suits are pending in two other states that segregate. Inmates with AIDS in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> say their medical care is grossly inadequate. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> prisoners assert that the level of their medical and psychiatric care is `` atrocious.'' `` They're treated like lepers. They might as well be wearing a scarlet letter. They're shunned, ostracized and stigmatized,'' said <PERSON> Alexa </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>, an attorney with the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, which filed the <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> suit. `` There is no logic, no rational basis and no medical basis to the -LRB- segregation -RRB- policy,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, former medical director at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Rikers </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prison </LOCATION> and an expert medical witness. `` It is only fear and discrimination which gives rise to such barbarous actions.'' Of the 12,000 inmates in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, 138 have tested positive for HIV since 1987. All but eight are men. Men are segregated at the Limestone Correctional Facility inside Dorm 7, where even the exercise yard is cut off from the main yard by a 14-foot-high chain-link fence topped with razor wire. The sense of doom is so heavy that inmates call it Thunder Dorm, recalling the futuristic city in `` Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome,'' a movie about society's collapse after a nuclear holocaust. Inmates eat with wooden ice cream sticks instead of forks and spoons. Meals come on color-coded trays. Their dirty laundry goes out in red plastic bags so it is washed separately. They worship apart from other inmates and do n't have equal access to programs that would allow them to have jobs or earn early parole. One inmate with the virus was forced to mop the halls behind him as he walked. Others were given surgical masks and made to clean telephones with bleach or ammonia swabs after making calls. `` The same hysteria on the streets is multiplied in prison,'' said <PERSON> Alvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bronstein </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Marsh </PERSON>, 41, a thief, said life in Thunder Dorm features fights, knifings and high-risk sex among prisoners who figure they're going to die anyway. `` Guys would rather be killed here than die from AIDS. They hunger for death another way. Any other way. Something that would be honorable,'' <PERSON> Marsh </PERSON> said. `` It's like living in the valley of the shadow of death. If AIDS do n't kill you, one of the guys might.'' Some inmates want to keep the HIV prisoners isolated, saying those infected would be killed `` as soon as they got into the yard.'' `` It's either we take them out or they take us out,'' said <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughey </PERSON>, 28, a rapist, who testified in favor of segregation in the <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> case. `` If one of them gets his semen or blood on an open cut, they just signed your death warrant.'' In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> state </LOCATION>, where AIDS is the leading cause of death among inmates, medical care is deficient, according to an 18-month study released last year by the <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>. Doctors were unfamiliar with AIDS treatment and detection, the study said. Since 1981, more than 500 prisoners have died of AIDS; in 25 percent of the cases, the disease was not diagnosed until an autopsy. Prisoners with AIDS also have an unusually low survival rate, the report said. Inmates from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> who got the disease from dirty needles had a mean survival rate of 159 days, half that of those in the outside community with similar backgrounds. `` AIDS and prison is proving to be a devastating combination,'' said <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Potler </PERSON>, author of the report. `` Imprisonment becomes a virtual death sentence.''

 <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> raisin growers heard it through the grapevine that <ORGANIZATION> Ocean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Spray </ORGANIZATION> plans to market sweetened dried cranberries as `` Craisins,'' which they say capitalizes on the success of their dancing raisins campaign. `` Why do they call it a Craisin if it's a cranberry?'' said <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> <PERSON> Nef </PERSON>, manager of the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Raisin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Fresno </LOCATION>. `` The farmers are upset. We've spent millions of dollars in changing the image and promoting <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> raisins. This appears to be an effort to capitalize on business we've created.'' The Craisin, a registered trademark, will be introduced this summer in <ORGANIZATION> Ralston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Purina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s Muesli cereal, which already contains raisins. It is red, slightly tart, and about the same size as a raisin. Ocean Spray, the Plymouth-based cooperative of cranberry growers in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, said it will be the first time cranberries will be used in cereal. The company hopes they are someday used in granola, cakes, muffins and other foods. Raisin growers, who have spent nearly $ 8 million this year on ads, have asked <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s attorney general to look into what they say is unfair use of the raisin name. `` We've spent millions of dollars building the raisin image up as a healthy, natural fruit of the sun. Now they put a ` c' in front of it and call it a Craisin,'' said <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Bedrosian </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Raisin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Fowler </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> `` We made it so popular, they just want to shirttail on our success.'' Ocean Spray spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawlor </PERSON> disputed the raisin growers' claims `` I do n't think there's any confusion here,'' he said Monday. `` It's very clear when you say Craisins are dried cranberries you're not getting a raisin We do n't feel it's unfair. We've taken out the trademark. It's been approved.'' Ocean Spray, which last year grossed $ 781 million from cranberry products, has steadily diversified over the years. Some raisin growers are convinced the Craisin wo n't prove to be much competition. Raisins, they pointed out, are merely grapes dried in the sun, while Craisins must be infused with sugar to make them palatable. `` It's just the skin of the cranberry, sugar infused, and it's very tart,'' said <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Penner </PERSON>, vice chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Raisin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>

 A week after <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> was buried, his grave in a dusty field has become a golden-domed shrine to which hundreds of thousands of Iranians a day make a mass pilgrimage in the scorching heat. They travel from all over the country to keep night-long vigils and touch the temporary monument over the grave of the octogenarian patriarch of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s revolution, who is rapidly being elevated to the pantheon of Shiite Moslem saints. Many believe <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s blessing and protection are bestowed on anyone who touches the square monument, fashioned from metal shipping containers covered in green cloth and topped by the large golden dome. The containers are on metal pillars and a metal grille gilded with spray paint allows people to see the grave. Marble slabs around it, buried under flowers, make the temporary structure resemble the tombs of other Moslem holy men. `` The Imam is the greatest man in Iranian history,'' said a teacher, who identified himself only as <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> and struggled with his 6-year-old son through the mass of humanity around the shrine. Iranians call <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> `` imam,'' or spiritual leader. `` He led the people back to our original faith, away from the materialism of the West,'' the teacher said in fluent English. `` I brought the boy here so he can remember this great day.'' `` Tell the world how we loved the Imam,'' said a white-bearded old man. He rode on the shoulders of a young man, leading chants extolling <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> `` the idol smasher.'' Around him, women wailed `` <PERSON> O </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, our days will never be the same without you!'' The golden dome, sparkling in the sun by day and floodlighted by night, has become a beacon for followers of the fierce-eyed cleric whose fundamentalist Islamic revolution ended a 2,500-year-old monarchy. All roads lead to the compound, 500 yards square, beside the huge <LOCATION> Behesht </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zahra </LOCATION> cemetery 10 miles south of <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> was buried there last Tuesday, three days after his death, to the accompaniment of hysterical anguish by 2 million Iranians. Shiite Moslem zealots, most of them poor people who saw <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> as their savior, struggle for hours through the crowds to reach the shrine. Officials estimate more than a half million people visit the grave every day. Toothless old men from the <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> slums and cities as far away as <LOCATION> Isfahan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mashhad </LOCATION> and Shiraz mingle with women clad in black head-to-toe chadors, babies clutched in their arms. As the waves of mourners inch closer to the grave, men beat their heads and breasts with their hands, hoarsely chanting verses from the Koran, <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>'s holy book, and slogans of loyalty to <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s teachings Some flail themselves with steel chains as drums beat slowly, a traditional ritual during Ashura, the month of mourning for <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>, the first Shiite spiritual leader and founder of the sect. Fire engines spray water over the crowds to cool them in temperatures that reach 104 degrees Fahrenheit under a blazing sun. People arrive in unending thousands in packed buses and trucks, tractors towing trailers, in cars and on motorbikes. Water tankers are parked every few yards for the thirsty throngs. Free iced lemonade and canned soft drinks are provided. Visitors to the grave must walk two miles through open fields under a thick cloud of choking dust raised by the constant traffic. The last half-mile to the square compound marked off by 10-foot-shipping containers is a nightmare of shoving and jostling. Revolutionary Guards in black uniforms herd women to one side of the compound, to keep them away from the men. They wail in mourning, their shrill lamentations drowning out the men's chants. Prayers chanted by mullahs, or Moslem clerics, blare from loudspeakers and blend with the wailing and chants into a numbing wall of sound. State radio and TV broadcast reports from the teeming scene almost every hour. Vast crowds pressed into the area the first days after the funeral, but no one was allowed to visit the grave until Friday, after the compound had been enlarged and the temporary monument erected. Authorities have begun a fund-raising campaign to finance a permanent monument. Money began pouring in as soon as it was announced.

 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s current leaders, once victims of the Cultural Revolution, are raising fears that they may be ushering in a new period of political chaos with their own crackdown on dissent. Many Chinese say they find strong similarities between the crushing of the pro-democracy movement and the leftist ideological purges of 1966-76, when thousands were suppressed by a campaign of propaganda, arrests and executions. The government of <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>, who was imprisoned twice during the Cultural Revolution, had pledged that there would never be a return to the rhetoric and radicalism of the past. But his government, as part of a propaganda campaign to discredit the protesters, has revived language not heard for more than a decade. Phrases such as `` counterrevolutionaries'' and `` a small band of schemers'' are reappearing in government announcements. The government is again making stinging criticisms of foreign governments and media. The <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, the broadcasts of which have been jammed recently, has come in for especially tough treatment for its coverage of the army's violent crackdown in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. Already, many Chinese are refusing to meet with foreign reporters as a climate of fear spreads in the capital. The military, which had withdrawn from an active involvement in the country's politics, again is playing a critical role. During the Cultural Revolution, the military intervened often to restore order caused by political conflicts. With the military's crucial assistance, the government is trying to round up the organizers of the democratic movement. During the Cultural Revolution, <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> was branded one of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s main `` capitalist roaders. Now he is using the techniques of his one-time accusers to fight the pro-democracy activists. The first volley came in April with the publication of an editorial that called the student movement `` chaotic turmoil'' and urged the suppression of its leadership, described as a `` small band of schemers.'' Chinese sources said the editorial was written on <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s command. `` It was as if I went back to the'70s,'' said an East European diplomat, who did his first tour of duty in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> in the 1970s. `` The use of terms like ` small band of schemers' and warning about ` chaotic turmoil' are a return to the thinking of the Cultural Revolution. In the space of a month, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> went back 10 years in time.'' In May, the government organized its own demonstrations to counter the pro-democracy protests being held in <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>. Workers in state offices were threatened with fines if they did n't attend, another throwback to Cultural Revolution-era practices Those who did attend were rewarded with bread and eggs. At one government rally, an effigy of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s most-famous dissident, <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> <PERSON> Lizhi </PERSON>, was burned. `` The government doing that is like something like 20 years ago -LRB- when -RRB- <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON> sent out the Red Guard. That is dangerous,'' said <PERSON> Fang </PERSON>, who has since taken refuge in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>. On June 3, the government took another page from its past when it used violence to clear <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, home to thousands of students and their protest for freedom. On April 5, 1976, when hundreds of thousands had gathered to commemorate the death of Premier <PERSON> Chou </PERSON> <PERSON> En-lai </PERSON>, the police were called out to empty the square with sticks and clubs. Many died in the police onslaught. Another similarity is that Chinese have been encouraged to inform on those who took part in the protests. In a modern twist, telephone numbers of reporting stations were published in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> newspapers. One man, identified as a `` rumor monger,'' was reportedly turned in two hours after his picture was broadcast on television. A main difference between the techniques of the Cultural Revolution and today's struggle is that the current campaign has yet to extend throughout the nation. One week into the crackdown, there are fears the worst has yet to come.

 Acting President <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON> met with military strongman Gen. <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> Monday after he conferred with an <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> mission trying to mediate <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s election deadlock. On its second trip to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, the Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> mission met separately Monday with <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON> and opposition party members. Immediatedly after his one-hour meeting with <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> officials <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON> met for another hour with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. The general was seen entering the governmental palace in civilian clothing with <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Duque </PERSON>, the government's candidate in the May election that was annulled. Panamanian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> told reporters later that Panamanian officials and the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> representatives were trying to find `` an acceptable formula'' for a dialogue between the government and opposition. `` This mechanism even though it obviously does n't exist yet.. this is what we are searching for,'' <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> did not speak with reporters. One OAS delegate, Ecuadorean Foreign Minister <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON>, said earlier he is confident the government and opposition have the political will to settle their differences. He said it is up to the Panamanians to resolve the dispute. The OAS only can `` promote a dialogue and perhaps give ideas based on our national experience based on similar situation,'' he said. <PERSON> Joao </PERSON> <PERSON> Baena </PERSON> <PERSON> Soares </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> secretary-general, and the foreign ministers of <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> and </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tobago </LOCATION> are the other members of the mission. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s political crisis began with the May 7 election, which international observers said the opposition won by at least a 2-1 margin. The government controlled by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> annulled the election and opposition candidates were attacked and beaten by his supporters. The <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> then agreed to send the mission to negotiate a national dialogue on the transfer of power on Sept. 1, as required by the constitution. On their first visit to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> at the end of May, the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> diplomats could not persuade the opposition and government to hold direct talks. Opposition leaders said they would talk only with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, and he refused. <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official who negotiated the Soviet withdrawal from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, was optimistic Monday. `` I think there is a political will in the government and the opposition that has to be translated into specific steps,'' he said. `` It seems to me that it is most urgent to establish mechanisms that allow Panamanians to talk and negotiate.'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and government officials blame <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s problems on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which they say wants to renege on 1977 treaties that turn over the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> at the end of the century. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, commander of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, was indicted on drug trafficking charges last year in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He denies the charges and has refused <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> demands he resign.

 A sightseeing plane that vanished between the islands of <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Maui </LOCATION> with 11 people aboard may have sent out an emergency signal Monday, but foul weather prevented rescuers from searching for it. `` There's an emergency signal coming from valley and we think it could be the plane,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Spangler </PERSON>. `` But the weather's so bad helicopters ca n't go in, and otherwise it's about a 10-hour hike.'' A <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> helicopter picked up the emergency transmitter's signal from the remote <LOCATION> Waimanu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> region of the island, which is on the northwest end of the island and within the missing plane's flight path, <PERSON> Spangler </PERSON> The valley had no vehicular access, he said, adding that no decision had been made whether to dispatch searchers to hike in. `` We're getting all our information together and seeing if the weather will let up,'' <PERSON> Spangler </PERSON> said. Heavy rain and low clouds persisted in the area Monday. The Scenic Air Tours Hawaii plane disappeared Sunday on what was to be have been an hour-long flight. A <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> cutter, <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> helicopter and seven <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> planes searched 1,279 square miles of ocean, said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartvigsen </PERSON>. Police on <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Maui </LOCATION> islands also checked areas where tour aircraft fly, he said. Air strips also were checked in case the pilot landed without informing the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON>. The twin-engine Beechcraft carrying a pilot and 10 tourists had left <LOCATION> Hilo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Kahului </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> and headed up <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>'s coast under partly sunny skies, disappearing without any indication of trouble, officials said The plane's last reported position according to <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> radar was about 10 miles north of <LOCATION> Hilo </LOCATION>, flying along <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>'s northeast coast, <PERSON> Hartvigsen </PERSON> said. Its altitude at that point was not known, <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> said investigators suspect that if the plane went down it is in the area of that last radar fix, because it was passing out of radar coverage and if it had gone further it likely would have been picked up by another radar station. The sky over the area was partly sunny with low scattered clouds, no rain and 15 to 20 mph wind at the time the plane disappeared, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. The plane took off about 1:15 p.m. and was to have landed at <LOCATION> Kahului </LOCATION> at 2:30 p.m., officials said. Alenuihaha Channel, which the plane would have had to cross to get to <LOCATION> Maui </LOCATION>, had 5 - to 6-foot seas at the time The last communication with the pilot was when he radioed an <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> ground station that he had taken off from <LOCATION> Hilo </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Maui </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> said. The plane was on a six-island tour, said company owner <PERSON> Doris </PERSON> <PERSON> Tom </PERSON>. The passengers had taken a ground tour of the erupting <LOCATION> Kilauea </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Volcano </LOCATION> before leaving <LOCATION> Hilo </LOCATION>, she said. Most of those aboard are Americans and two are from <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, but the names are not being released because not all the families have been notified, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Tom </PERSON>, the operations manager for the tour company. In 1987, a twin-engine <ORGANIZATION> Panorama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tours </ORGANIZATION> plane with eight people aboard disappeared without a trace on a flight from <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Molokai </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>.

 Three <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> art dealers set up a sting with the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> that led to the recovery of nine Old Master paintings stolen from a <LOCATION> Swiss </LOCATION> art gallery and three arrests, according to a televised report. The nine paintings, worth more than $ 5 million, were stolen along with 12 other Old Masters on April 12 from the Koster Gallery in <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION> by three men who tied up a gallery employee at gunpoint, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Agent <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickard </PERSON> told the Art Market Report, a weekly <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> program that aired Monday night. The theft and arrests were disclosed for the first time on the cable television station. Swiss police did not announce the theft, hoping the robbers would try to sell the paintings if it was not publicized that they were stolen, said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Schillay </PERSON>, one of the three art dealers who run a gallery in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. A week after the theft, a man called Schillay from <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and told him he had an important collection he wanted to sell in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Schillay </PERSON> and his partners at the <ORGANIZATION> Schillay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Rehs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> gallery, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> and <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehs </PERSON>, became suspicious when the man could not explain why he wanted to sell the paintings here and not in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The man also `` went through a whole grandiose story about how important his family was. ... In our dealings here in the gallery, we meet a number of people of wealth and virtually none of them present themselves in this manner,'' said <PERSON> Schillay </PERSON>. The man also could not answer questions about the condition of the paintings, estimated the worth of one painting at $ 500,000 when it was actually worth $ 1.5 million, and made no inquiries about the gallery's background, as is customary for sellers to do, the dealers said. A man who claimed to be the seller's son brought the paintings to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and later the seller came too. Schillay & amp; <PERSON> Rehs </PERSON> had several experts examine the paintings, and they were found to be genuine Old Masters. Eventually, <PERSON> Schillay </PERSON> came across an expert who had heard of a theft of Old Masters from a Koster Gallery. The tip led Schillay to contact a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> dealer who often invests in works at the <LOCATION> Koster </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> man confirmed that the paintings were stolen. Schillay & amp; <PERSON> Rehs </PERSON> then called the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. On May 1, two <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents posing as employees of <ORGANIZATION> Schillay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Rehs </PERSON> arrested the seller, <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Grove </PERSON>; <PERSON> Thierry </PERSON> <PERSON> Houze </PERSON>, the man who had posed as his son; and a woman, <PERSON> Martine </PERSON> <PERSON> Wins </PERSON>, according to <PERSON> Schillay </PERSON>. <PERSON> Pickard </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent who set up the sting, said the trio were being held without bail in the <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, awaiting indictment on charges of possession of stolen goods and bringing stolen goods into the country. One of the gunmen in the heist is still at large, <PERSON> Schillay </PERSON> said. The other 12 paintings stolen in <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION> were not recovered, but <PERSON> Schillay </PERSON> said <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Grove </PERSON> was negotiating turning them over in exchange for being transferred to a Swiss prison. The paintings recovered were still-lifes, landscapes, portraits and other 17th - and 18th-century Dutch and French paintings, most of them 7 by 9 inches or smaller, by the following artists: <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Heem </PERSON>, <PERSON> Marten </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryckaert </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Meartens </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Steen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Moillou </PERSON>, <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Reysdael </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Hals </PERSON>, <PERSON> Adrien </PERSON> <PERSON> Coorte </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cornelius </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Heem </PERSON>, <PERSON> Schillay </PERSON> said

 The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said for the first time Monday night that Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, D-Pa., is not the target of a criminal investigation The department statement backed up what <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> and his lawyer said they have been told by <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents ever since word leaked out last month that <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> had been visited by two <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents on Memorial Day. The department's statement came less than two days before a vote in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> for the post of majority whip, the third-ranking leadership position among Democrats. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> is contending with two others for the job. `` Congressman <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> is not the target of a criminal investigation by the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>. Congressman <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> and his office have been fully cooperating with the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>,'' said a statement read by spokesman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Eramian </PERSON>. The spokesman said Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> had authorized his executive assistant, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, to make the statement. <PERSON> Eramian </PERSON> declined to answer questions on why the statement was issued Monday night. Government sources, speaking earlier on condition that they not be identified, said the department had opened a preliminary investigation into whether <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> had a `` no-show'' employee on his staff. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> said from the outset he knew of no such employees, and members of his staff have said since that they had found no evidence of one. In a statement issued Monday after the department's, <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> said: `` I have said from the beginning that I am not a target and this confirms it. I have said from the beginning that I and my staff have cooperated full and this confirms it. I have done nothing wrong and this too will be confirmed.'' <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Plebani </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>'s chief of staff, said he had been told that the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> decided to issue the statement because reports about the investigation of <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>'s office `` have done Congressman Gray a serious disservice and have inappropriately been a factor'' in the Whip contest.

 Fighting between Christian and Syrian forces has paralyzed the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beirut </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>'s most prestigious academic institute, and much of the rest of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s educational system. But senior university officials are bent on reopening as soon as they can the seaside facility that has given the Arab world at least three presidents, 10 prime ministers and more than 100 Cabinet ministers and ambassadors. Acting President <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Salti </PERSON> contends the university will resume classes 48 hours after the latest round of fighting stops in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 14-year-old civil war. Since fierce artillery battles broke out March 8, thirty-three shells from Christian east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> have hit the campus of the 123-year-old <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, causing damage estimated at $ 600,000. <PERSON> Salti </PERSON>, a Jordanian, insisted in an interview: `` AUB is still healthy despite its unhealthy environment.'' The university was founded in 1866 by <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Bliss </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> missionary from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. It was chartered under the laws of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state. Classes were suspended March 23, one month into the final 1989 semester, when the artillery battles broke out. The campus drew Christian artillery fire after the Syrians set up gun positions near the university. Despite a shaky cease-fire declared by the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> on May 11, Syrian gunners, including those near the university, daily shell Christian ports to stop supplies reaching their foes. The only reported university casualty among the 363 people killed and more than 1,400 wounded was <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Haddad </PERSON>, 60, a Lebanese librarian killed by shrapnel April 16 as she walked to the medical library. Many of the 80 red-roofed stone buildings around the 73-acre campus are pocked with shell splinters. Most of the 5,300 Arab, Asian and African students have gone. The medical school, with 268 students, remained functioning throughout the fighting. Its hospital, the largest in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> with 421 beds, treated 60 casualties an hour during the worst of the shelling. Students at the university and at other colleges who had hoped to graduate and head abroad to study in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and western <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> have been forced to take shelter in bunkers rather than take exams vital to careers. <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Samad </PERSON>, director of student affairs at the Education Ministry, said more than 200,000 students were unable to take final tests for their high school diploma because of the fighting. <PERSON> Abed </PERSON> <PERSON> el-Naser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arayissin </PERSON>, 26, a computer science student at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.-affiliated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beirut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> hoping to study in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, hoped to finish school by the end of summer. `` But because of what's happened, I'll have to do another year making up for the one I've lost because of the civil war.'' In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> AUB </ORGANIZATION>'s American president, Dr. <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Herter </PERSON>, said recently: `` We're prepared to extend the current semester into the summer in order to complete all necessary academic requirements.'' No one is sure when the <ORGANIZATION> AUB </ORGANIZATION> will reopen. <PERSON> Herter </PERSON>, a 68-year-old surgeon, has not been to the university since he was named president in March 1987. <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> is off-limits for Americans because of the wave of assassinations and kidnappings that engulfed the university, the first to introduce American education into the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and a target for anti-Western Moslem fundamentalists. The university founder's grandson, <ORGANIZATION> AUB </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodge </PERSON>, became the first of many kidnap victims in 1982. He appeared in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> capital, a year later. His successor, <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerr </PERSON>, was assassinated by a gunman outside his office on Jan. 18, 1984. Soon after, the campus was swept by a wave of abductions. Among those kidnapped was <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> librarian <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Kilburn </PERSON>, seized Dec. 1, 1984, and political science professor <PERSON> Leigh </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>, a Briton, kidnapped March 28, 1986. Their bodies, along with that of another kidnapped British educator, were found April 18, 1986, three days after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> air raids on <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. Two other kidnapped <ORGANIZATION> AUB </ORGANIZATION> officials _ acting dean of agriculture <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON> and acting comptroller <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON> _ are among nine Americans still in captivity. Education Ministry officials say that if <ORGANIZATION> AUB </ORGANIZATION> stays closed, so will <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s 17 other universities in Moslem and Christian sectors and most of the country's 3,000 schools, which have a combined enrollment of more than 800,000. `` We ca n't run the risk of resuming classes under repeated shelling threats and have our students get killed on campus,'' said <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> <PERSON> Maroun </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> schools official. Schools and colleges in north and south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, untouched by the fighting, have remained open.

 Children, grownups, even the monkeys and apes stare up at sculptor <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Weitzman </PERSON> as he transforms a 28-foot tree stump at the National Zoo into a mirror of the exotic life around him. Using chainsaw, drill, mallets and chisels from his scaffolding, <PERSON> Weitzman </PERSON> is sculpting a tribute to zoo volunteers from the barren trunk of a nearly century-old willow oak that was chopped down last year because it was dying. He found the stump lying abandoned near a creek in the zoo. <PERSON> Weitzman </PERSON>, 36, a native of <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, who came to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> by way of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, has been working since last August to convert the trunk into a work of art honoring those who `` maintain our extended family _ the flora and fauna of the planet.'' He already has inhabited the upper reaches of the stump with a miniature zoo. Among the carved figures are a swooping American bald eagle, a scowling orangutan, a contented panda, great blue heron, water lizard, tree shrew, fish, squirrel and a giraffe nibbling greenery offered by the outstretched hand of a young man. `` Can you find the tree frog?'' <PERSON> Weitzman </PERSON> asks passersby. -LRB- It's crawling out of its hole just below the black palm cockatoo. Operating on a $ 20,000 commission from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zoo </ORGANIZATION> and its volunteer organization, Friends of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zoo </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Weitzman </PERSON> works almost daily _ except when it rains _ in the hope of finishing his sculpture by the end of October. His studio is a fenced-in plot on the sun-drenched lawn facing the zoo's reptile and monkey houses. The tourists swarming below are n't simply gawkers. <PERSON> Weitzman </PERSON> occasionally invites someone to mount the scaffolding to model an ear or nose for the human figure he is carving. Early on, <PERSON> Weitzman </PERSON> got some helpful kibitzing from a denizen of the zoo's nearby monkey island. `` I was trying to carve an eagle but the tree was saying, no, this wo n't work,'' he said. `` I wrestled with it for two or three days, cussing at myself, but it was not becoming an eagle. It just got worse and worse. `` Then I had the feeling something was watching me. I looked over my shoulder and there was a Barbary ape sitting over there with his hands on his knees, staring at me. So I forgot the eagle and carved him looking back at himself.'' With a friendly eyes and a smile as wide as his mustache, <PERSON> Weitzman </PERSON> encourages his spectators to step forward, grab a chisel and make their own artistic imprint. `` One of my aims is to dispel the illusion that artists are a unique branch of humanity, to show the public that creating a piece of art work is not beyond most people's ability,'' he said. `` People say, aw, you're so lucky. I wish I could carve like that. I say, come up here, confront your fears and I'll show you how to do it. `` Three hours later, they're still carving. They say, ` Wow, I can do it','' <PERSON> Weitzman </PERSON> says. `` It's all about pursuing your dreams. My dream is to do this sculpture out of a five-ton tree stump. Yours might be singing, dancing, writing, painting, crocheting. Everyone has something to communicate. What it takes is tenacity ... pursuing it with all of your heart. `` If you work your butt off, if you work really hard, you can do it. Maybe it wo n't be the best in the world, but so what?''

 Virginians vote today in a <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> primary to choose an opponent for <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>, the Democratic nominee seeking to making history as the nation's first elected black governor. Polls show a deadlock in the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> contest among former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Trible </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, former Attorney General <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Stanford </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Parris </PERSON>. Today's primary is the first GOP gubernatorial primary in the state since 1949. <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>, the state's lieutenant governor, was nominated Saturday at a unified state Democratic convention. He and his running mates, businessman <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Beyer </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> for lieutenant governor and <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> for re-election as attorney general, launched a statewide tour Monday. All 2.6 million registered voters can participate in the primary because <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> does not have registration by party, but turnout in the Super Tuesday presidential primary in March 1988 was only 235,000 on the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> side. <PERSON> Trible </PERSON>, 42, had led all polls until last week. But two surveys published as <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> turned 47 on Thursday put him about even with <PERSON> Trible </PERSON>. <PERSON> Parris </PERSON>, 59, was was close enough to the leaders to fall within the polls' sampling errors. A poll released last week showed each of the three <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> contenders leading <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>, but only slightly. <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>, 58, is nurturing his image as an underdog, a tactic which helped parlay him into the lieutenant governorship in 1985.

He has portrayed himself as a social moderate and fiscal conservative and has played down the racial aspect of the contest, as have the three <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> contenders. The nation has not had a black governor since Reconstruction and has never actually elected one. Lt.

<HEAD>Wife of Ethics Chairman Makes Big Profit on Small Investment</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The wife of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee chairman <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> earned over $ 150,000 in two years from an investment of less than $ 15,000 in companies that help run stores at <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. Airport officials are looking into the two companies to determine whether they qualified properly as minority contractors. Although they had identical boards of directors, one was listed as a minority enterprise while another was listed as being run by women. On Monday, <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> amended his 1986 financial disclosure form to show that his wife, <PERSON> Betty </PERSON>, paid between $ 5,000 and $ 15,000 for the investment in the companies. <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Calif., initially told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> he did not have to reveal how much Mrs. <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> paid for the high-yield investment because she owned no stock in the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> companies, <ORGANIZATION> Mir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Peideau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION> But he told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> clerk in a letter Monday that `` upon recent review'' of the companies' articles of incorporation `` it appears that, technically, <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> is deemed a stockholder.'' `` In this light, her acquisition of interest in Mir Kanon-Peideau in July 1986 also should have been reflected in the transaction section,'' <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> said. He said in a telephone interview he was `` sorry that I made that mistake'' of not disclosing the cost of the investment. `` Obviously I feel badly about it.'' <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>'s forms from 1986 showed that Mrs. <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>'s investment was worth between $ 100,000 and $ 250,000. Thus, the investment appears to have soared after she paid between $ 5,000 and $ 15,000 for it in July 1986. Mrs. <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> invested in Mir Kanon and <PERSON> Peideau </PERSON> three months after the companies were part of a joint venture awarded the concession to run duty-free stores at the world's third-busiest airport. <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, who gained prominence in presiding over the ethics committee probe that ended with the resignation of Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, said in a telephone interview that the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> investment has been `` better than we ever expected.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> received dividends of over $ 100,000 in 1988 and of between $ 50,000 and $ 100,000 in 1987, according to financial forms disclosed for those years. <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> said there was nothing improper about his wife's business arrangement and that she was the `` ideal person'' to sit on the companies' boards because she has a background in retailing. Her <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> business, `` <ORGANIZATION> Much </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> About </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Something </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>,'' distributes advertising novelties. As a member of both companies' boards, Mrs. <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> said she attends meetings and helps set corporate policy. `` I do n't have a job there, not a 9-to-5 job,'' she said. <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> airport officials are checking to see if the companies meet requirements to qualify as minority contractors. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Kroh </PERSON>, the airport's property manager, said he has uncovered nothing `` illegal or immoral'' about the multimillion-dollar concession business. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, the airport's deputy executive director, said officials `` want to make sure they are a bona fide minority business enterprise and women's business enterprise.'' When airport commissioners awarded the duty-free concession, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said, <PERSON> Mir </PERSON> <PERSON> Kanon </PERSON> was classified as a minority enterprise, while <PERSON> Peideau </PERSON> was classified as a business run by women. But <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> records show the companies had identical boards of directors on Sept. 28, 1988. They also had the same agent, who listed the same address in <LOCATION> Culver </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> `` That is not the way it was proposed to us originally,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. However, he said airport officials knew from the beginning there was overlapping ownership in <LOCATION> Mir </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kanon </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Peideau </PERSON>, in that prominent <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> businessmen <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>, a contractor; and <PERSON> Felker </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, an attorney, own part of the businesses. <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, who also a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said his wife's high-yield investment has never affected his decisions in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` I'm sure I've supported bills that have supported the airport,'' said <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, whose congressional district abuts the airport. `` I do n't recall any specific requests that I've made to members, nor have I contacted the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>'s revision came as the finances of congressional spouses are in the spotlight because of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s resignation after being charged with 69 violations by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee. The committee contended that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s wife received improper gifts from a wealthy businessman, a charge <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> denied. Last week, <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> initially declined to disclose how much his wife paid for her investment, saying she did n't own stock in the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> companies. House ethics rules permit members to amend their financial disclosure statements if a change is made in a timely fashion after new information is brought to a lawmaker's attention. In 1988, <ORGANIZATION> Duty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shoppers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, the majority partner in the duty-free concession, accumulated gross revenues of $ 78 million from the airport shops, airport officials said. Mir <PERSON> Kanon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Peideau </PERSON> have 32 percent of the business in a joint venture with Duty Free Shoppers to run the duty-free stores, airport officials said. The companies also are part of the concession for gift and news stores.

 President <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> said Monday night he will resign on June 30, nearly six months before the scheduled transfer of power, but President-elect <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> said that's too soon. <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> and his <ORGANIZATION> Peronist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> defeated <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>'s centrist <ORGANIZATION> Radical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> bloc in May 14 national elections and the inauguration of the new president and congressional winners was scheduled for Dec. 10. <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>, 62, said in a 15-minute broadcast to the nation that <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s disastrous economy forced his resignation. Interest rates and unemployment have approached record levels and at least 11 people were killed late last month in food riots and looting. `` I have decided to resign effective June 30, 1989, the post of president of <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> said. Vice President <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> also will resign on June 30, he said. Two hours after <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>'s address, <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> issued a statement saying it was `` impossible'' for him to take office on June 30, and criticized the `` unilateral'' decision by <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>. The statement, read by the news secretary of <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rioja </LOCATION> province, <PERSON> Adrian </PERSON> <PERSON> Freijo </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> `` had no alternative'' but to allow the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> president, <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>, to act as interim president, as called for in the constitution. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>, 58, is governor of <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rioja </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> is his brother. Earlier, <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> representative <PERSON> Rodolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Terragno </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> said he would take over in August at the earliest. <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> had said in a radio interview earlier in the day that June 30 `` seemed to me to be too fast'' to take over. In his speech <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> said the accord he sent to <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> `` until now ... only has my signature.'' He said the document includes his pledge to support the <ORGANIZATION> Peronist </ORGANIZATION> economic program, help renegotiate the foreign debt, and cooperate in investigating any alleged wrongdoing by his administration. Earlier, Interior Minister <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Pugliese </PERSON> announced the <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> will convene June 21, more than seven weeks ahead of schedule, to confirm <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>'s presidency. <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> could not run for re-election under the constitution, and his party's presidential nominee, <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Angeloz </PERSON>, was defeated by <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>. In an interview Monday, <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaroslavsky </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Radical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> deputies in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, said the final obstacles to a hand-over were worked out in weekend talks with the Peronists. `` It's just not possible to govern the country under these circumstances,'' <PERSON> Jaroslavsky </PERSON> said. `` There is no other mechanism than to speed up the transfer of power.'' The two parties apparently resolved that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, which in 1983 set Dec. 10 as the transition date, will set the new date, and that Radical legislators will support Peronist legislative projects. Similar talks were cut short three weeks ago because they could not agree how to stabilize <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s economy. <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> wanted to raise rates for public services to balance the budget. <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> rejected that as `` anti-popular.'' <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> wants the new <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to take office the same day he does because <ORGANIZATION> Peronists </ORGANIZATION> won virtual control of both houses in the May 14 balloting. Peronists reportedly are considering issuing a new currency to replace the devalued austral; setting a high exchange rate to spur exports and curtail imports, and granting big wage increases to ease social tensions and generate demand. A final stumbling block appears to be an issue that has stymied <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> since his Dec. 10, 1983, inauguration: trials of officers accused of human rights violations during the 1976-83 military regime's `` dirty war'' on leftists. At least 8,961 Argentines vanished after being arrested by security forces and are presumed executed, according to a commission appointed by <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>. Human rights groups say the actual number may be two or three times as high. <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> clearly wants <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> to settle the issue by ending the trials. <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> had half a dozen officers prosecuted and then cleared hundreds of others.

 They've toured his house, marveled at the gold records and jeweled jumpsuits and checked out his lavish airplanes. And now, for the <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> fans who thought they'd seen it all, there's more. `` It's <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> and <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and the automobile,'' says <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Elvis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automobile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION>, which opened Monday. `` It's <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON>' love affair with cars and <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s love affair with cars.'' The museum has more than 20 vehicles once owned by the king of rock' n' roll and is the newest attraction at the 46,000-square-foot souvenir shopping center at <LOCATION> Graceland </LOCATION>, Presley's former <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> residence. More than 650,000 tourists and fans visited Graceland last year. For a $ 15.95 see-it-all ticket, fans can tour the house, two of <PERSON> Presley </PERSON>'s airplanes, his tour bus, a couple of small museums and the new 13,000-square-foot automobile display. It costs $ 3.50 for the automobile museum alone. The $ 1.5 million automobile museum, which includes replicas of a drive-in movie and a 1950s filling station, features vehicles ranging from a go-cart to Presley's favorite <PERSON> Stutz </PERSON> <PERSON> Bearcat </PERSON>. Many of the vehicles were kept until last year under a backyard carport at Graceland, and they had fallen into serious disrepair, said <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Classic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Car </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>. Even the 1955 pink <ORGANIZATION> Cadillac </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Presley </PERSON> gave his mother was in rough shape, said <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, whose company restored the vehicles for the museum. Like many of the display vehicles, the Caddy had to be stripped to its frame and rebuilt, he said. However, much of the machinery inside the vehicles is still in mint condition. `` If you raised the hood, the engine is just like the day <LOCATION> Presley </LOCATION> gave it to his mother,'' <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> said. The museum includes TV screens beside several of the vehicles showing home movies of Presley or his family. A short film of Presley movie clips showing him with various vehicles is featured at the drive-in movie set at the center of the museum. For seating, the set has 38 front seats from 1957 Chevrolets. Graceland is operated for the financial benefit of Presley's only child, <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Marie </PERSON>, 21, who will inherit the house and tourist complex at age 25. She has agreed to leave the operation with its current management at least until she is 30. Last year the complex took in $ 12 million, up from $ 9 million two years ago, said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Soden </PERSON>, general manager of the Graceland Division of <ORGANIZATION> Elvis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION>. Presley died of heart disease in 1977 and <PERSON> Graceland </PERSON> soon became a mecca for the <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> faithful. The fans were barred from the house until 1982 when the Presley estate hired <PERSON> Soden </PERSON> and other professionals to take advantage of <PERSON> Graceland </PERSON>'s potential as a tourist attraction. <PERSON> Soden </PERSON> said he expects <PERSON> Graceland </PERSON>'s business to keep growing, including plans to join outside investors to open an Elvis museum in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. Managers of the Presley estate also expect to take part in a music museum to be built in downtown <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>.

 Former tanker captain <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> has pleaded innocent to state charges of criminal mischief leveled after the Exxon Valdez rammed a reef, triggering this nation's worst oil spill. If convicted of the three felony counts of second-degree criminal mischief, <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> could face up to 15 years in jail and $ 150,000 in fines. He entered his plea Monday in <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. Officials on Monday also announced the <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s Exxon Valdez would be towed to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> for more than $ 25 million in repairs. <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>, 42, of <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, has already pleaded innocent to misdemeanor charges of operating a ship while intoxicated, reckless endangerment and negligent pollution. He remains free on $ 50,000 bail. The felony case was scheduled for trial before <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bosshard </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> on June 20, the same day <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> is to go on trial on the misdemeanor charges before <PERSON> Bosshard </PERSON>. The Exxon Valdez rammed <LOCATION> Bligh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reef </LOCATION> early March 24, pouring nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil into Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>. Before the accident, <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> had turned over control of the 987-foot ship to the third mate. Nearly 11 hours after the accident, the captain had an illegally high blood-alcohol content, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Madson </PERSON> of Fairbanks, said he would try to have the trials consolidated and moved to <LOCATION> Fairbanks </LOCATION>. `` I do n't think the state wants the cost and inconvenience of two trials any more than we do,'' he said <PERSON> Madson </PERSON> said his client had flown in from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for the arraignment and would return almost immediately. <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> now fishes for lobsters commercially there, <PERSON> Madson </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Bush Redefines Clean Air Debate</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has redefined the debate in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> over clean air and taken a leap forward in convincing environmentalists that while he may not be one of them, he's not the enemy either. To many environmentalists, the significance of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s three-pronged proposal Monday to clean up the nation's dirtiest air is that it came forcefully from the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> along with a clear acknowledgement by the president that air pollution is putting millions of Americans at risk This is in sharp contrast to the eight years President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> occupied the White House. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> did not acknowledge acid rain as being an environmental concern and viewed tougher laws to curb urban smog and toxic industrial chemicals as excessive government regulation. With Republicans in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> rallying around the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> clean air package `` the political chemistry is going to change dramatically'' and the debate will center on finding a middle ground between the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> bill and more stringent Democratic versions, said <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Hair </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>. `` The Republicans are now going to be in the bidding game on environmental issues,'' agreed <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Krupp </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>. He said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> package will serve as `` a vehicle that's going to drive this -LRB- issue -RRB- through <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' `` We no longer need to debate what the goals will be,'' suggested <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Pritchard </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardiner </PERSON>, legislative director of the <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposal `` will definitely break the logjam.'' That is not to say the power picture in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has not also changed significantly from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> years and likely will be just as important. Sen. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, sponsor of an acid rain bill last year, is now <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> majority leader. He succeeded Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, who for years has been a staunch opponent of any legislation that might harm the high-sulfur coal industry in his Public opinion polls also have told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the president that the voters are keenly interested in removing the yellowish smog from urban areas, want to be protected against the release of toxic industrial chemicals into the air, and approve of curbs on acid rain which is destroying lakes, streams and forests hundreds of miles from the tall stacks of coal-burning power plants. Such is the mood that Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, who in the past has blocked clean air legislation opposed by the auto industry, responded to the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> package by saying `` the broad outlines appear reasonable. To be sure, there are provisions and details of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s clean air package that brought criticism and uncertainty from the environmental community. At the same time it was characterized as trying to move too far, too fast by the coal industry. Despite those industry complaints, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal to cut sulfur dioxide emissions from coal burning power plants in half by the year 2000 _ a key to curtailing acid rain _ prompted widespread praise. It was more than many environmentalists had expected. `` The president basically sided with those in the administration who wanted a stronger proposal,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Frampton </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Wilderness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, alluding to reports of sharp disagreement among some <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> advisers over details of package. So, while environmentalists continue to chide <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for his slow response to the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> oil spill tragedy and criticize him for a handful of mid-level appointments involving public lands and parks, they also suggest that there is growing evidence his commitment to protecting the environment may not be purely rhetoric. They see the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> clean air proposal as the clearest sign of that so far. `` I believe the environment won today,'' a beaming <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, told reporters after briefing them on the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> proposal.

<HEAD>Bush Action Wins Overall Praise, Although Particulars Draw Criticism</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has won praise for proposing the clean air package his predecessor would n't touch, but he faces division over provisions on acid rain, airborne toxic chemicals and auto emissions. `` I think he got an A for effort,'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ayres </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION>, said Monday after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced his proposal. `` He's heading in the right direction.'' <PERSON> Ayres </PERSON>' reaction was typical of the praise that flowed from environmentalists, industry spokesmen and lawmakers. Viewing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposals as generally positive, they nonetheless took issue with particulars <PERSON> Ayres </PERSON>, for example, said he was concerned the plan put too much emphasis on new, cleaner fuels rather than cleaning pollution from existing gasoline engines. Much criticism also came from groups with vested financial interests, who said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> went too far. The coal industry and officials from mining states, for instance, predicted utility customers would pay for the switch to low-sulfur coal. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> summed up the remarks of many when he called <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan `` a significant departure from the negative environmental policy of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, which opposed every clean-air bill considered by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for the past eight years.'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, was chief sponsor of the major clean air bill last year, and his elevation to majority leader this year has led to numerous predictions of an end to a decade-long congressional gridlock. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> alluded as well to the previous inertia. `` Too many Americans continue to breathe dirty air, and political paralysis has plagued further progress against air pollution,'' he said. `` We've seen enough of this stalemate. It's time to clear the air.'' The proposal would attempt to leave most cities free of urban smog by the year 2000 and to sharply reduce acid rain pollution. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> recommended that automakers be required to build and sell methanol-powered cars in nine urban areas plagued by dirty air. He proposed that limits on tailpipe emissions of ozone-producing hydrocarbons in existing cars be tightened by almost 40 percent. A proposed 10-million ton reduction in sulfur dioxide from coal-burning power plants, a major cause of acid rain, would mean a 50 percent cut in these deadly emissions. And <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said industry should be required to use new technology to curb the release of cancer-causing toxic chemicals into the air. The most critical voices came from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. Va.. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said the acid rain provisions would unfairly penalize the high-sulfur coal areas like his state `` by leading to massive switching from high-sulfur to low-sulfur <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, called some provisions `` unnecessary, unduly harsh and economically onerous'' and warned that `` electric ratepayers will likely pay more for electricity.'' Bush Chief of Staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> said the stiffer standards would add 5 percent to 10 percent to utility rates in 18 states that burn high sulfur coal and contribute the most to the acid rain problem. But he said their rates would still fall below the national average. The Clean Air Working Group, representing 1,950 companies and associations, said it recognized `` the innovative, positive ideals'' in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan. But the group said the alternative motor vehicle fuels plan was excessive, and agreed with the coal industry that utilities _ under the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> plan _ would be unwilling to spend money on new, clean coal technology. The technology would not achieve results until 2005, according to the coal industry, too late to meet the year 2000 deadline for reducing sulfur dioxide. Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif., called the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> plan `` a welcome departure'' from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's lack of action, but added: `` I do not think the proposal goes far enough in ... controls on mobile sources -LRB- motor vehicles -RRB-, which are the single largest source of ozone and carbon monoxide pollution `` The tailpipe emission standards in force today are standards established in the Clear Air Act of 1970.'' But <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> MacCarthy </PERSON>, director of federal liaison of the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Assocation, including the Big Three <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carmakers, said `` we do n't support'' tougher tailpipe emissions standards. He said the retirement of older cars, increased emissions inspection and maintenance programs and pilot projects on alternative fuels are a much better idea. But he said `` there is a very good likelihood there will be some tightening of tailpipe standards.'' Sen. <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Baucus </PERSON>, D-Mont., the chief sponsor of clean air legislation in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> this year, said, `` The rhetoric is good, but it's a bit vague in the urban smog provisions. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardiner </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, called the air toxics part of the bill `` the weakest'' portion of the proposal. He said industry would not have to use the best possible technology to reduce toxic emissions, and predicted the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> standards `` will not make a dent'' in the problem. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, said cleaning the air `` will neither be free nor easy.'' For example, electric bills are expected to increase by 2 percent in some states to clean up coal-fired electric plants. At a briefing before <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s speech, <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> estimated the overall program would cost between $ 14 billion and $ 19 billion a year after it is in full effect at the turn of the century.

 <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> has been assured he's not a target for possible prosecution in the Iran-Contra affair, a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official says, but <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>'s appointment as ambassador to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> still faces an uphill climb in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. `` The administration has no interest is appointing as ambassadors individuals who are the targets of grand jury investigations,'' the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s chief legal adviser, <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sofaer </PERSON>, said in a letter to Sen. <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` Mr. <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> would withdraw from consideration if his conduct was so regarded by a federal prosecutor,'' said the letter, made available Monday. `` This has never been the case, however, and it is not so today.'' The committee has delayed <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>'s confirmation while it investigates allegations that while serving as Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s national security adviser in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> helped in the illegal resupply of the Nicaraguan Contra rebels Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif., who has spearheaded the committee's investigation of <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>, has said he finds <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>'s firm denials of such activity `` hard to accept <PERSON> Sofaer </PERSON> said Independent Counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> told <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> that he was a `` subject'' of the Iran-Contra investigation being conducted by <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> but `` not a target.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Attorney </LOCATION>'s Manual describes a subject as `` a person whose conduct is within the scope of a grand jury's investigation,'' <PERSON> Sofaer </PERSON> said A `` target'' is described as a `` person to whom a prosecutor or the grand jury has substantial evidence linking him @ her to the commission of a crime.'' `` Under longstanding practice, a ` target' who is a witness before a grand jury is warned that his ` conduct is being investigated for possible violation of federal criminal law,''' <PERSON> Sofaer </PERSON> said. `` When Mr. <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> testified before the grand jury he was informed that he was not a target, and was not told that his conduct was being investigated for possible violation of federal criminal law,'' he said. Speculation that the grand jury might be preparing to indict <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> on perjury charges stemmed from <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s noncommittal reply when asked by <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> whether <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> was a target of the Iran-Contra probe. In that reply, dated June 1, <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said it is accurate that the investigation `` extends to perjury and false statements before the Iran-Contra hearings'' as evidenced by the indictment of retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said his office had made no statement about <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> and was `` unable to comment further at this time.'' Under an agreement between <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> members of the committee, who contend <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> is being subjected to an unfair ordeal of `` delay and leaks,'' <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> will be questioned under oath at a second investigative hearing on Thursday. <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> has said he will permit the full committee to vote on the <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> nomination on June 20.

 Reporters roundly criticized an effort by columnist <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> to test security at the Capitol by smuggling in a gun, an action that could also lead to criminal charges and revocation of his media pass. `` This was <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> making a quick buck,'' <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Franken </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. He called <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s action a `` trivialization'' of journalism. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Mutual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> called <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s technique `` a stunt.'' <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> said someone such as <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, a nationally syndicated columnist, is known and might have an easier time getting into the Capitol without as thorough a check as lesser-known individuals. But <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said Monday that he did not carry the gun into the building himself because he realized there was a possibility he would be recognized and therefore not checked as carefully as a person not known to security officers. He said the accomplice who carried the weapon was with his party but `` went in far enough ahead of me I do n't think that person would have been associated with me.'' The accomplice was not named. <PERSON> Franken </PERSON> praised the Capitol police for carrying out the difficult task of providing security while allowing people access to their elected representatives. `` Those are opposing philosophies,'' said Officer <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON>, spokesman for the Capitol Police. The building draws 20,000 visitors daily, he said. <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> said police and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> are investigating whether to file criminal charges against <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> in connection with the May 24 incident. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> pulled the pistol out of his pocket while taping an interview about terrorism with Sen. Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., in the senator's office The columnist could be charged with possession of a gun inside the Capitol, a felony punishable by a $ 5,000 fine, five years in jail or both. Lesser charges also are being considered, <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> said. Additionally, the committee that hands out media credentials is considering revoking <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s privileges. `` For us, the issue is narrow: Did he abuse his position as a reporter?'' said Wall Street Journal reporter <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Birnbaum </PERSON>, chairman of the committee which credentials about 2,000 daily print journalists. He said the five-member committee could take away <PERSON> Andrson </PERSON>'s credentials, reprimand him or do nothing after a hearing that has not yet been scheduled In an informal survey, reporters who cover <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> regularly expressed nearly unanimous displeasure for <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s act. <PERSON> Kenan </PERSON> <PERSON> Block </PERSON>, a producer for MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour, said he did a similar story on airport security when he was reporting for a local station. `` It's a cheap shot,'' he said. `` It's kind of a cliche. I thought <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> would do a more sophisticated story.'' <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Mjority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> have threatened to require more time-consuming searches of the media if the credentials committee does n't `` deter any future repetition of this act.''

<TEXT>
 Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has taken the lessons of the Cuban missile crisis to heart, changing his government to reduce chances of a superpower confrontation, say <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> veterans of the incident. Over the past two years, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has authorized disclosure of reams of new information on the 1962 crisis, said <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Garthoff </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomat who played a role in the crisis and has written a book on it. At a seminar on his book, <PERSON> Garthoff </PERSON> said the Soviets have decided the crisis stemmed from a decision reached by then-Soviet leader <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> to send nuclear missiles to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> without adequate consultation with other members of the Politburo. `` Like the Afghan invasion, it is seen as an error caused by having too few people involved in a decision,'' said <PERSON> Garthoff </PERSON>, who revised an earlier book on the basis of new Soviet disclosures. <PERSON> Garthoff </PERSON> is now a scholar at the <ORGANIZATION> Brookings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>. The decision to invade <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979 was made by then-Soviet President <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> and a handful of Politburo members, according to other Soviet disclosures. The Soviets withdrew their forces from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> this year. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON>, who was the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary during the Cuban missile crisis, said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s close attention to the incident shows his `` sensitivity to the dangers'' that nuclear weapons pose. <PERSON> Garthoff </PERSON> and <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON> interpreted many of the reforms proposed by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, such as enhancing the presidency, giving more power to the Soviet parliament and publishing reports on meetings of the ruling Politburo, as efforts to expand the number of people involved in decision-making. <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON>, like <PERSON> Garthoff </PERSON>, has taken part in a series of U.S.-Soviet meetings on the missile crisis, including one in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> last January attended by <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON>, who was foreign minister at the time of the crisis, and by <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Dobrynin </PERSON>, who was the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> at the time. <PERSON> Dobrynin </PERSON> angered <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials during the crisis by telling them that there were no Soviet nuclear missiles in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dobrynin </PERSON> assured participants at the conference in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> last January that he had not known about the missiles and <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON> confirmed that, according to <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON>, who also took part in the seminar. <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON> leaned across the conference table, cracking a rare smile, and said: `` I thought I told you on the way to the airport.'' `` No, you did n't,'' <PERSON> Dobrynin </PERSON> replied, according to <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials at the time had aerial photographs showing launch pads for Soviet SS-4 and SS-5 missiles, capable of reaching the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, but could not confirm that the warheads had been sent to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. Recent Soviet disclosures have revealed that 20 nuclear warheads were in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, and that 20 more were en route aboard the Poltava, a Soviet freighter turned back by the naval quarantine that President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> ordered around the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> island during the crisis, according to <PERSON> Garthoff </PERSON>. Recent Soviet disclosures have unraveled many mysteries of the missile crisis, including the decision to down a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> U-2 spy plane over <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> at the height of the crisis, said <PERSON> Garthoff </PERSON>. Col. Gen. <PERSON> Dmitri </PERSON> <PERSON> Volkogonov </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> History </ORGANIZATION>, told <PERSON> Garthoff </PERSON> in an interview that the decision was made by two Soviet generals in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and was not cleared by their superiors. The downing of the American spy plane caused <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> `` shock and dismay,'' <PERSON> Grathoff </PERSON> said Soviets told him recently. Although Soviet officials have been speaking more openly of the crisis, said <PERSON> Garthoff </PERSON>, they have not yet declassified any internal documents from that era, in contrast to the American government, which has released thousands of pages of such material. Among the disclosures from the declassified <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> material was that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fighters sent to rescue another U-2 that wandered inadvertently over Soviet territory were armed with nuclear-tipped Genie anti-aircraft missiles, said <PERSON> Garthoff </PERSON> and <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON>. The presence of the Genie missiles was disclosed previously in a book by <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Sagan </PERSON>, `` Moving Targets,'' also based largely on declassified <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> documents.

<TEXT>
 Hungarian Cardinal <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Mindszenty </PERSON> hid out for 15 years at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>. Ten-thousand Cubans once sought refuge on the grounds of the Peruvian Embassy. Now, Chinese dissident <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> <PERSON> Lizhi </PERSON> is holed up in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. All have taken advantage of the right of foreign embassies, long secured in diplomatic law, to grant protection to dissidents and defectors from the countries where they are located. Sometimes, an embassy's granting of refuge can provide an easy way out for everyone in a political conflict. Foreign missions have been used as a convenient conduit, especially in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, to quickly get toppled leaders and their relatives out of the country after a revolution. But far more often, the granting of embassy refuge to opponents of the host government aggravates diplomatic tension. It can also put a heavy burden on the mission doing the sheltering. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s leaders on Tuesday showed their anger at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision to grant refuge to <PERSON> Fang </PERSON>, calling it an interference in internal affairs. They ordered a nationwide alert for <PERSON> Fang </PERSON>, telling local authorities to arrest him if he is seen trying to escape the country. Under international law, embassies are the territory of the country they represent, not territory of the host country. Therefore, a dissident or defector who makes it to a foreign embassy is usually safe from pursuit, if the embassy takes him in. The embassy has no ability, however, to guarantee the refuge-seeker safe passage out of the host country. In many cases, embassies that have supported a dissident feel a moral obligation to help him when he gets into trouble. `` Oftentimes, these people will go into an embassy where they have friends, and it's because of these friends and associations that they're being pursued in the first place,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Tarnoff </PERSON>, the president of the New York-based Council on Foreign Relations and a former <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official. <PERSON> Tarnoff </PERSON> said in an interview that despite the dislocation that the practice sometimes causes for embassies, most diplomats believe the right to grant refuge is a useful diplomatic privilege. That includes nations of all ideologies, said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lichenstein </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and now a fellow of the <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> think tank in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` The most established totalitarianisms, like the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, to the best of my knowledge respect these principles,'' <PERSON> Lichenstein </PERSON> said in an interview. Dictatorships, he said, tend to claim that their own dissidents or defectors who take advantage of embassy refuge are in fact common criminals, not political activists. Perhaps the longest-running modern case of embassy asylum was that of <PERSON> Mindszenty </PERSON>, who was arrested by <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s communist rulers in 1948 as an enemy of communism and sentenced to life in prison. Hungarian revolutionaries freed him during the 1956 uprising, but <PERSON> Mindszenty </PERSON> took refuge in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mission in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> after <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> forces crushed the revolt. He lived there until the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> arranged for his release to the West in 1971. Many embassy refuge cases have involved the East bloc. In the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, seven Pentecostalists claiming religious persecution lived for five years in a cramped room at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, leaving in 1983. In the freer atmosphere now prevailing inside the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc, it has even become possible now for citizens of one bloc country to seek asylum from another. <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has seen many instances of foreign embassies or diplomats helping to evacuate losers in political struggles. When <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Peron </PERSON> was overthrown in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> in 1955, he took a boat to <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> under Paraguayan government protection. In 1973, after <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Allende </PERSON> was overthrown as president of <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> and died in a battle in the presidential palace, his widow and her children received refuge in the <ORGANIZATION> Mexican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>. The Mexican government then flew them out of the country. The largest number of people to seek refuge at a foreign embassy at once may have been in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> in April 1980, when 10,000 Cubans entered the grounds of the Peruvian Embassy seeking to emigrate. Cuban authorities eventually persuaded the crowd to go home, but eventually almost all of them received exit visas. And in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, some 20 prisoners and anti-apartheid activists have taken refuge in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, British, West German and Dutch diplomatic missions in recent years. Most were eventually allowed to go free, with South African government assurances that they would not be punished.

<HEAD>Court Ruling a Setback to Victims' Rights Advocates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The victims' rights movement, despite achieving some recent legislative success, has suffered a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> setback for the second time in two years. The high court, by a 5-4 vote, ruled Monday that a jury choosing between the death penalty and a life prison term for a convicted murderer generally may not be told about the victim's personal characteristics. The justices said a <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> murderer unfairly was sentenced to death because a prosecutor told jurors the victim was a religious, community-minded person. Also Monday, in another 5-4 decision, the court gave white men significant new power to challenge court-approved affirmative action plans, even years after they take effect. The court said white <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, firefighters are entitled to a day in court to try to prove an affirmative action program for hiring and promoting blacks makes them the victims of unlawful reverse racial bias. In contrast, the court on Monday killed, by a 5-3 vote, a sex-discrimination lawsuit by three women who work at an <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T plant in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, ruling they had waited too long to challenge seniority system changes. Writing for the court in the capital sentencing case, Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said the jury's life-or-death decision can not be based on factors of which the defendant was unaware. His opinion relied heavily on the court's 1987 decision in which `` victim impact statements'' were barred from sentencing trials in which the death penalty is one possibility. The <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> had passed a law requiring sentencing courts in murder cases to allow members of the victim's family to testify about the crime's impact on their lives. Other state legislatures had passed similar measures. The court's four dissenters in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> case said Monday they are ready to overturn the 1987 decision. But Justice <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, a dissenter in the 1987 case, sided with <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> and provided the decisive vote. Justices <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> completed the court's majority. Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> and Justices <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> dissented. <PERSON> Demetrious </PERSON> <PERSON> Gathers </PERSON> was convicted of a 1986 killing in a <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, city park. He killed <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON>, 32, during an attack in which <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON> was beaten and stabbed. At Gathers' sentencing trial, a state prosecutor focused on <PERSON> Hayne </PERSON>'s characteristics. The prosecutor, in his closing argument, told jurors that among the things found at the murder scene were various religious items and a voter registration card belonging to <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON>. `` We know from the proof that ... <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON> was a religious person ... -LRB- he -RRB- believed in this community. He took part,'' the prosecutor said. The <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said those statements deprived Gathers of a fair sentencing trial, and Monday's decision upheld that ruling. `` The content of the various papers the victim happened to be carrying when he was attacked was purely fortuitous, and can not provide any information relevant to the defendant's moral culpability,'' <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> wrote.

<HEAD>Winter Wheat Crop Estimated at 11-Year Low Because of Drought</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A further decline in this year's wheat prospects is prompting renewed calls for federal drought aid to hard-hit farming areas that have not yet recovered from the 1988 burn-out. The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says farmers are harvesting a winter wheat crop estimated at an 11-year low of 1.41 billion bushels, down 10 percent from last year's harvest and 2 percent below the May forecast. Based on June 1 surveys, the latest estimate announced Monday compares with last month's forecast of 1.43 billion bushels and the 1988 winter wheat harvest of 1.56 billion bushels. The next estimate will be July 12. Officials said the average yield, based on June 1 conditions, was estimated at 34.5 bushels per acre, compared with 34.9 bushels per acre estimated in May and last year's per acre average of 39.2 bushels. Farmers are expected to have about 40.8 million acres for harvest this year, up 3 percent from 39.8 million acres in 1988, the department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said in its report. `` Once again, we see evidence of a significant shortfall in the wheat crop on an expanded area,'' said <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwensen </PERSON>, executive vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wheat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Growers </ORGANIZATION>. `` The outlook is not likely to improve from this point onward.'' Winter wheat, planted in the fall and harvested the next summer, makes up about three-fourths of total <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat production. The remainder is planted in the spring. Next month's crop report will include production estimates for spring-planted wheat, thus providing the first 1989 look at total <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat output. The first estimates of 1989 output of corn, soybeans, cotton and other major crops will be issued Aug. 10. Lingering drought and late-season freezes crippled much of the winter wheat crop in parts of the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, notably in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> where this year's harvest was estimated at 202.4 million bushels. That was unchanged from May indications, but far below last year's harvest of 323 million bushels The continuing effects of drought in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and some other states have stirred demands for federal aid comparable to the $ 3.9 billion emergency measure passed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last year to help cover 1988 losses. Legislation has been introduced to expand 1989 drought assistance, but the administration has opposed any massive rapid-fire remedies until more is known about the crop situation. <PERSON> Schwensen </PERSON> said the June winter wheat report `` highlights once again the need for federal disaster legislation.'' The skimpy wheat outlook is not expected to have a major impact on the price of bread or other food products, according to <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> economists. Overall, they expect consumer food prices to increase an average of 5 percent to 7 percent in 1989, compared with last year's average gain of 4.1 percent. Higher vegetable prices stemming from severe winter cold and lingering effects of last year's drought are major factors. In a related supply-and-demand report, <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> projected total 1989 wheat production _ a figure based on assumptions of normal weather and trend yields _ at about 2.03 billion bushels, up from last year's 1.81 billion bushels. That was down slightly from the May projection. The report showed that wheat prices could rise to an average of $ 3.80 per bushel to $ 4.20 per bushel in 1989-90, from $ 3.74 per bushel in the wheat marketing year that ended May 31. With higher prices ahead, wheat exports could decline to 1.15 billion bushels, from 1.44 billion bushels in 1988-89, the report said. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat stockpile June 1, 1990, would be down to about 500 million bushels from 616 million bushels on hand this June 1.

 Farmers have contracted with the government to take an additional 2.46 million acres of highly erodible cropland from production under the 10-year Conservation Reserve Program. The additional acres were enrolled during the program's eighth round of signups held Feb. 6-24, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. The next will be July 17 through Aug. 4. <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Bjerke </PERSON>, administrator of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stabilization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said the total contracted under the <ORGANIZATION> CRP </ORGANIZATION> is nearly 30.6 million acres. <PERSON> Bjerke </PERSON> said the total now exceeds the 28.7 million acres that was in the 1960 Soil Bank program, making the <ORGANIZATION> CRP </ORGANIZATION> `` the largest long-term cropland retirement program in <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. history.'' Under the program, farmers agree to take their land from production for 10 years. In return, based on bids they submit, farmers who are accepted get annual rental payments from the government and one-time assistance to pay for half the cost of planting trees, shrubs and grass to guard against erosion. Average annual rental payments have been running close to $ 50 per acre. The goal set by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in the 1985 farm law is to have 40 million to 45 million acres in the program by 1990.

<HEAD>Deal Would Have Made $500 Million for Backers of Failed US Nuke Plant</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration last month approved the sale of nuclear power plant equipment to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> that would have allowed backers of a canceled <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plant to recoup $ 500 million, but later rescinded the license after protests from the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. Two weeks after issuing an export license for the sale, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> rescinded it following complaints from the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> and a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee chairman who said the deal violated a 1985 congressional resolution on nuclear non-proliferation, officials said Monday. The primary beneficiary of the sale would have been holders of $ 2.25 billion in bonds now held in trust by the <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>, according to the officials. The bonds were declared in default after a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Public Power Supply System plant near <LOCATION> Olympia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, was canceled in 1982. `` We viewed it initially as an attempt to circumvent the law,'' said <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>, staff director of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Governmental Affairs. `` We discovered the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> was n't even aware of this export. The committee's chairman, Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, complained in a letter to <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> that the shipment would `` undercut'' a 1985 congressional ban on such sales unless the president first certified that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is not helping other countries build nuclear weapons. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> has been a frequent critic of what he says is <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s clandestine trade in nuclear-related materials with Third World countries, particularly <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> nations <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials originally contended that a non-proliferation declaration from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was not needed because the export license was only for non-reactor components. However, he said <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> later informed <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> that the deal was being deferred pending consultation with the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>. All of the events took place before the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government's crackdown on student demonstrators in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> The proposed sale stems from cancellation of nuclear power plants in 1982 by the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supply </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> and 88 participating local utilities in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION>. The cancellation of the plant 45 miles west of <LOCATION> Olympia </LOCATION>, at <LOCATION> Satsop </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, and another at <LOCATION> Hanford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, touched off the biggest bond default in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history and scores of suits by bondholders. Last fall, a tentative settlement was reached in which <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> and the local utilities agreed to pay bondholders roughly 20 cents on every dollar they invested in the two plants. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said the settlement _ which has yet to be approved by a federal judge on <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION> _ also called for the bondholders to receive any proceeds from sale of the unfinished plants' equipment and other assets. `` There's no direct benefit to the supply system other than we're the custodian for selling the plants' assets for the best return of the bondholders,'' he said <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Denton </PERSON>, director of governmental and public affairs for the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>, said his agency protested the sale because neither the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> has not certified to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> `` is a full-fledged member of the non-proliferation club.'' In addition to the export license for non-nuclear components of the Satsop plant, <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> also has sought permission from the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to sell its atomic reactor and 250,000 pounds of enriched uranium fuel to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> rejected those license requests earlier this year because of the lack of a certification of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s non-proliferation status from the president, <PERSON> Denton </PERSON> said. Among those lobbying for the export licenses were <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> as the bondholders' trustee; the plant's designer, <ORGANIZATION> EBASCO </ORGANIZATION> Services of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Combustion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the supplier of the plant's reactor, officials said. While the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> is in charge of licensing export licenses for reactors and nuclear fuel, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has export licensing authority for all non-nuclear electric power plant components. However, such licenses are not normally approved by either agency until after interagency consultations among the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disarmament </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and the State, <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> departments. He said the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> license was issued in early May `` without consulting with us'' but withdrawn two weeks later `` after we found out about it.'' `` It sounds to me like it was an oversight on their part, because normally they do consult with us,'' <PERSON> Denton </PERSON> said. `` In this case, they did n't. They've corrected that.'' Since then, he said, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to condition any license for the export of non-nuclear components on <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> approval of a reactor sale. Both of those events, he said, are contingent upon certification by the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the White House that the sales would pose no risk of nuclear weapons proliferation.

<HEAD>Jury Recommends Stiff Penalties for Jenrette in Shoplifting Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The jury that convicted former congressman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenrette </PERSON> of shoplifting says he should pay a heavy price for the necktie and shoes he stole from a suburban <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> department store. <PERSON> Jenrette </PERSON> was found guilty Monday of stealing the items and switching price tags on two pieces of clothing. The <ORGANIZATION> Fairfax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury deliberated only 35 minutes before convicting the former lawmaker of the two misdemeanor charges. The jurors recommended six months in jail and a $ 1,000 fine for each of the two violations. Sentencing was set for Aug. 18. The 53-year-old former congressman from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> served 13 months in prison and is still on probation for bribery and conspiracy convictions in the Abscam scandal. `` This could trigger three years extra in prison,'' <PERSON> Jenrette </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Merril </PERSON>, said `` He has his entire life left to lose. He's going back to the penitentiary and he's losing any chance to practice law again.'' Upon hearing the verdict, <PERSON> Jenrette </PERSON> stared straight ahead and showed little emotion. He left the courtroom through a back exit to avoid talking to reporters. `` It's a tremendous setback to his life,'' <PERSON> Merril </PERSON> said. `` It appeared that he had put his troubles behind him. Now, he's got major problems.'' <PERSON> Jenrette </PERSON> had been found guilty of the charges by a <LOCATION> Fairfax </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Circuit </LOCATION> judge on Feb. 23. He appealed that verdict in order to bring his case before a jury, where he felt he could succeed in establishing reasonable doubt. But the jury ended up believing the testimony of two security guards at <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>'s discount department store in <LOCATION> Tyson </LOCATION>'s Corner, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Heather </PERSON> <PERSON> McKeever </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> told jurors they viewed <PERSON> Jenrette </PERSON>'s every move through the zoom lens of a security camera last Dec. 7 Ms. <PERSON> McKeever </PERSON> said she saw <PERSON> Jenrette </PERSON> put on a pair of store shoes and place his own in the bottom row of the store's shoe rack. Ms. <PERSON> McKeever </PERSON> said <PERSON> Jenrette </PERSON> also pocketed a tie and replaced the price tags on a pair of pants and a shirt with tags he removed from lower priced merchandise. <PERSON> Jenrette </PERSON> paid $ 14 for items valued at $ 80. The tie retailed at $ 17.99 and the shoes were $ 39.99. When he was apprehended, the former lawmaker had $ 139 and several credit cards in his pockets. `` He said he was sorry and asked if there was anything he could do for me personally,'' Ms. <PERSON> McKeever </PERSON> testified. <PERSON> Merril </PERSON> built his case around the fact that the camera did not tape the incident, so there was no physical evidence that <PERSON> Jenrette </PERSON> switched the labels. He also questioned the accuracy of the camera, and asked jurors to note that <PERSON> Jenrette </PERSON> left behind a $ 125 pair of shoes. <PERSON> Jenrette </PERSON> testified that the tie was his own. He said he brought it into the store to compare it with one he was thinking of buying, and <PERSON> Rosemary </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jenrette </PERSON>'s self-described girlfriend, backed him up by saying she saw the tie in his car trunk a week before the incident. As for the shoes, <PERSON> Jenrette </PERSON>'s excuse was absent-mindedness. `` I flat forgot it,'' he said. `` I had them on for 35-40 minutes, and embarrassingly forgot I had them on.'' <PERSON> Merril </PERSON> told jurors in his closing argument that a conviction based upon the evidence provided would be `` a disgrace.'' Prosecutor <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickett </PERSON> chose to attack <PERSON> Jenrette </PERSON>'s defense, calling it `` totally fiction.'' `` This defendant, for some perverted pleasure, went in and stole those items,'' <PERSON> Pickett </PERSON> said. `` It's hard to imagine a more clear-cut case.'' <PERSON> Jenrette </PERSON>, a Democrat who served in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> from 1975 to 1980, was sentenced to two years in prison and five years probation after his conviction in the Abscam sting operation in which <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents posing as Arab sheiks and businessmen offered bribes to lawmakers. `` It will take an awfully strong person to come back from this,'' <PERSON> Merril </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Mock Awards Given to `Most Misleading Ads'</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 As the advertising industry preened to receive its annual awards for excellence, consumer groups issued mock awards of their own for the year's `` most misleading, unfair or irresponsible ad campaigns.'' Balancing the industry's coveted `` Clio'' awards, given Monday night in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the consumer groups issued their <PERSON> Harlan </PERSON> <PERSON> Page </PERSON> <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON> awards, named for a pioneer advertiser of patent medicines that were supposed to cure whatever ailed you. The `` winners'' of <ORGANIZATION> Hubbards </ORGANIZATION>, should they choose to accept them, are entitled to a bronze-colored victory figure grasping a lemon. The results were announced Monday by the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> in the Public Interest. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Awareness </ORGANIZATION>, a previous `` Hubbard'' recipient, was singled out `` for claiming that nuclear power can reduce oil imports when, in fact, most oil is used for gasoline for which nuclear power can not substitute.'' <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON>, spokesman for the group, said, `` we do n't pay a whole lot of attention to things like this.'' He said the advertising claims `` are responsible and verifiable'' and should be judged `` by what responsible people think about it.'' <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> was cited for advertising a $ 298 round-trip fare to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, including hotel and car, `` when the actual cost of the trip ranges from more than $ 700 to $ 1,400,'' according to the <ORGANIZATION> CSPI </ORGANIZATION>. `` <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> is no longer running the ads and have no further comment regarding the award,'' said <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>, a spokesman for the airline. <ORGANIZATION> Anheuser-Busch </ORGANIZATION> was cited for beer commercials featuring a dog named <PERSON> Spuds </PERSON> <PERSON> MacKenzie </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> CSPI </ORGANIZATION> said the commercials appeal to people under the legal drinking age and associate drinking with athletics. `` As a responsible corporation, we are satisfied that neither the Spuds MacKenzie advertisements nor our other brand commercials promote underage consumption,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roarty </PERSON>, an executive vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Anheuser-Busch </ORGANIZATION>. `` Our commercials are placed only in programming in which the majority of viewers are above the legal minimum age to consume beer.'' <ORGANIZATION> R.J. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>, selected for similar reasons, did not respond to a request for comment from public relations spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Fischel </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> CSPI </ORGANIZATION> also gave `` Hubbards'' to <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, of <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, `` for implying that its ` Zaks' toy could operate on its own power when a child must move the toy''; and to <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benefit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION>, `` for claiming that a life insurance policy with ` big dollar benefits' could be purchased for $ 3.95 a month when the policy provided as little as $ 1,000 worth of coverage. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Grandy </PERSON>, advertising manager for <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> Art, described the toy as being like a puppet _ `` the creatures you can build have mouths that move, ears that wiggle; a puppet moves because someone moves it.'' A call to the life insurance firm, which uses big-name, older actors in its commercials, was not returned. <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes-Benz </ORGANIZATION>, spotlighted `` for encouraging reckless high-speed driving at 125 mph,'' said it was surprised that such inferences were drawn from the advertisement at issue. `` There's nothing reckless or irresponsible in the ad,'' said A.B. <PERSON> Shuman </PERSON>, manager of public relations for the company. `` It shows the car is capable of driving in its native country at those speeds and the indication is there's a tremendous reserve of handling, comfort and safety in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> at our speed limits.'' <PERSON> Bain </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Soleil </PERSON> was chosen for the award `` for promoting high-priced products containing a sunscreen rating from 20 to 30 when the highest meaningful degree of protection most consumers can benefit from is a sunscreen rating of 15.'' Not so, said <PERSON> Debra </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennets </PERSON>, the company's director of communications. `` We take issue with their assumption. ... Many dermatologists view a skin protection factor of 15 as a minimum and not a maximum level protection that's needed.'' She said the Skin Cancer Foundation, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> have within the last year recommended daily use of sunscreens with a rating of 15 or higher. However, a consensus panel organized by <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> last month concluded that `` there was no evidence'' that a protection factor above 15 provided any additional protection. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pork </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Producers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> was selected for `` claiming that pork is nutritionally equivalent to chicken even though most cuts of pork are higher in saturated fat and cholesterol than chicken.'' `` That's not true,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Harness </PERSON>, a spokesman for the pork producers. `` Pork centerloin broiled contains 8.9 grams fat per 3-ounce serving. Compare the same thing to a chicken thigh, skin on and roasted. That's 13 grams of fat.'' <ORGANIZATION> Thompson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, makers of Dexatrim diet pills, was chosen for advertising `` the non-prescription drug would not cause nervousness or irritability even though the active ingredient in the product is a recognized stimulant.'' Said <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaplan </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the company, `` we sweepingly reject the charge and we believe that the charge itself is misleading. The active ingredient in Dexatrim is not a stimulant and does not make you nervous when taken in recommended doses.''

Department spokesman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Eramian </PERSON> said Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> authorized his executive assistant, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, to make the statement. <PERSON> Eramian </PERSON> declined to answer questions on why the statement was issued Monday night. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>'s top aide, <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Plebani </PERSON>, said he had been told the department issued the statement because officials there believed news leaks about the investigation had done <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> a `` serious disservice'' and possibly had influenced the whip contest. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, currently chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION>, is one of three candidates for the post. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, in a statement, said: `` I have said from the beginning that I am not a target and this confirms it. I have said from the beginning that I and my staff have cooperated fully and this confirms it.

 Two Chinese diplomats, who denounced their government after the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> massacre, remained in hiding today to study their options after declining to ask for political asylum. The young consulate officers, the first Chinese diplomats to defect to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since the Communist Revolution in 1949, met for several hours Monday with the <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` They have n't requested anything,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ilchert </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> regional director. `` They are not in <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> custody and told us they do not wish to make any statement to the press. They're mulling over the options and may wish to seek legal counsel.'' Meanwhile, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s consul general in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> issued a brief statement calling the defections `` utterly unjustifiable,'' and said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is `` making representations'' to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> regarding the case. The defectors are worried about giving up their homeland and careers but did n't appear to be worried about violent reprisals against them, said <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Held </PERSON>. He said the consulate officers, who are at an undisclosed site in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area, are not in <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> protective custody. One of their options is to simply remain in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for another year, under the visa extension granted to all Chinese nationals last week by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. <PERSON> Zhou </PERSON> <PERSON> Li-min </PERSON>, 26, vice consul for cultural affairs, told the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> in an interview published Monday that he has supported the students cause `` in his heart'' since the start of the student protests in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Zhang </PERSON> <PERSON> Li-ming </PERSON>, 25, vice consul for overseas affairs, said the two planned for several days to defect and decided to announce it at a candlelight vigil planned outside City Hall. At the vigil, which was attended by about 5,000 people, they told the stunned rally they decided to defect after <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> leaders launched a propaganda campaign claiming no citizens had died in the clash in and around <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> on June 4. `` We are supposed to tell you that no one was injured or killed. Why? Because we are diplomats. But we wo n't fake it here. Before we are diplomats, we are Chinese and we are human beings,'' <PERSON> Zhang </PERSON> said. The Chinese government says nearly 300 people were killed, mostly soldiers. However, Chinese witnesses and Western intelligence said the toll could be as high as 3,000, most of them civilians. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s historian's office in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> reported that <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> and <PERSON> Zhang </PERSON> are the first such official Chinese seeking asylum in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since the revolution.

 Twin earthquakes that shook <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> did little harm, but they scared people and highlighted the danger from recently discovered faults concealed deep beneath the nation's second-largest city The temblors, however, suggest the danger may be more likely to come from a series of moderate quakes than from a much-feared `` big one.'' `` Nothing that happened today makes us fear a larger earthquake any more than we did before,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Geological Survey seismologist <PERSON> Lucile </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>. `` What happened today should make you feel a little more relieved.'' The Monday morning quakes injured one person and caused scattered minor damage downtown and in suburbs to the east, including cracked plaster, fallen ceiling tiles and broken windows. Scientists said the sharp jolts at 9:57 a.m. and 10:22 a.m. measured 4.5 and 4.3 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale, respectively. They were centered on the Elysian Park Fault about 8 -LCB- miles beneath Montebello, a city about 10 miles southeast of downtown <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. At least five more small aftershocks followed. The temblors sent high-rise construction workers and window washers sprinting into downtown <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> streets and stranded some elevator passengers momentarily. `` It felt like a bomb struck the building,'' said <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON>, a downtown worker. Panicky callers overloaded telephone lines, making it impossible to get dial tones in many areas, said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Guerin </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. Based on historical patterns, <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> faces a 1 percent to 2 percent chance of a bigger earthquake within three days, said <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>. The Elysian Park Fault cuts a 60-by-10-mile swath through the heart of the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION>, stretching from Corona northwest to <LOCATION> Whittier </LOCATION>, then west to downtown <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Malibu </LOCATION>. It was discovered after causing the Oct. 1, 1987, <ORGANIZATION> Whittier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Narrows </ORGANIZATION> quake, which, with its aftershocks, killed eight people, injured more than 200 and caused $ 358 million in damage. That quake also spurred discovery of another fault, the 40-by-10-mile Torrance-Wilmington Fault, stretching from <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> northwest through <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>' <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION> district, <PERSON> Torrance </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION>. Scientists do n't know if the two faults relieve stress only by causing numerous mild-to-moderate quakes of magnitude-4 to 6, or also during infrequent major-to-great quakes of magnitude-7 to 8, said geologist <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sieh </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION>. A major quake directly under downtown <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> would be far worse than a `` big one'' on the more distant <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Andreas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fault </LOCATION>, about 50 miles to the north. Officials estimate a big <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Andreas </LOCATION> quake could kill up to 14,000 people, seriously injure up to 55,000 and cause $ 17 billion in damage. On the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale of ground motion, every increase of one number means a tenfold increase in magnitude. An earthquake of 3.5 can cause slight damage, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage, 6 severe damage. A 7 reading is a `` major'' earthquake, capable ofwidespread heavy damage; 8 is a `` great'' quake, capable of tremendous damage. The number of quakes in the basin has been twice normal since March 1986, <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. Some scientists believe that suggests an increased likelihood of a major quake, but the fact the recent quakes on the Elysian Park Fault have been mild to moderate hints that future quakes on the fault may be about the same, not larger, she added. It takes many smaller quakes to release the same stress as a disastrous jolt, so `` I do n't think any of us would be surprised if we had a flurry of 5s and 6s over the next 30 years,'' <PERSON> Sieh </PERSON> said. On Monday, one woman was treated for head, neck and back pain and released from a hospital after a ceiling tile hit her at the Criminal Courts Building. At the county Hall of Administration, many people attending a <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supervisors </ORGANIZATION> meeting fled outside as ceiling and wall cracks sprinkled falling plaster into the auditorium. The jolt also sent rookie basketball player <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivers </PERSON> running for the exit of the Forum, where the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lakers </ORGANIZATION> were watching film of Sunday's game of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Basketball </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>'s championship series. `` I thought <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> -LRB- of <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> -RRB- was the quickest guard in the league, but not after I saw <PERSON> David </PERSON> run for the door,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Lakers </ORGANIZATION>' <PERSON> Mychal </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said.

 Admitting years of steroid use in his quest to become the world's fastest man, <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said he knew the drugs were banned but never would have taken them had he known of their potentially harmful side effects. `` Nobody bothered to tell me what the side effects were because they were happy to be making all this money,'' the Jamaican-born sprinter told a Canadian inquiry into drugs and athletics on Monday. Nearly nine months ago, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> tested positive for the muscle-building anabolic steroid stanozolol and was stripped in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> of the 100-meter Olympic gold medal he won representing his adopted country. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, whose only previous statement since the disgrace had been that he never knowingly used illegal drugs, still must tell the inquiry what happened in the weeks leading up to Sept. 24, when he tested positive. On Monday, under oath, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> started what could be several days of testimony by admitting steriod use for the first time. `` Every shot that I got with an injection from -LRB- his coach and teammates -RRB-, I had in my own mind that it was banned,'' he said. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said that his first use of steroids was in pill form in 1981 and 1982, the steroids Dianabol and stanozolol taken under direction of <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Francis </PERSON>, his coach since 1977. `` Charlie's my coach and if he gave me something to take, I'd take it,'' he said But by the time of the 1983 Pan American Games in <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said he was aware that he was getting steroids, that they they were banned and that he risked disqualification if they were found in his system. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said he left to others the concern about clearance times, or how long before competition he had to stop taking the drugs so his system would be free of them. `` I'm not the coach, I just take orders,'' he said. He differed only from <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> and personal physician, Dr. <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON> <PERSON> Astaphan </PERSON>, on the issue of whether they informed him about steroids' potential for damaging health `` If they told me what the side effects were at that time, I would n't have been part of the group at all,' the 27-year-old <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. The sprinter said it was <PERSON> Francis </PERSON>' idea that he use steroids. `` I did n't go up to him and say I wanted to take it. He said the whole world was using them and the only way I'd get better was if I took these drugs,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> delivered eight days of often sensational testimony to the inquiry in February and March, saying he believes athletes need to take them in order to be competitive because their use is pervasive among world-class athletes. <PERSON> Astaphan </PERSON> confirmed in his appearance that he provided steroids for <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> since 1984. The doctor boasted of his ability to beat steroid tests and could not explain why stanozolol was found in <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s system at <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s mother, two sisters and brother were in the hearing room as the athlete calmly answered questions, often responding only yes or no. His father was home in <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>. The athlete forfeited his 9.79-second performance at <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> because of the positive test but still holds the world record of 9.83 seconds set at <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> in 1987. He has said he hopes to compete again after the end of the two-year ban that the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amateur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Athletic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>, which governs world track and field, imposed for the positive test. Estimates of the amount of endorsements and other income that <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> lost as a result of the Olympic scandal run as high as $ 20 million.

 Rock singer <PERSON> Chrissie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hynde </PERSON> has promised to make no more public remarks about firebombing <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> restaurants. The lead singer for The Pretenders had infuriated the fast-food chain by her joking reply when asked what she had done for the environmental group <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION>. `` I firebombed McDonald's,'' she said last week. Police say they may want to interview <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Hynde </PERSON>, who is a strict vegetarian, in connection with a firebomb attack on a McDonald's in suburban <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Keynes </PERSON> last weekend. McDonald's threatened to take legal action against the singer, who has frequently spoken out against <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION>'s in the past, unless she gave assurances that she would not repeat the inflammatory remark. In a statement worked out by lawyers for the two parties, Miss <PERSON> Hynde </PERSON> insisted Monday that her remarks Thursday at an album-promoting <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> news conference had been taken out of context. `` However, I am prepared to give an unequivocal undertaking that I will at no time suggest or imply that I have been responsible for firebombing McDonald's or that anyone should firebomb or cause any other physical or personal damage to the customers, employers, franchises or the physical property of <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Restaurants </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> or any of its associated companies anywhere in the world.''

 Officials welcomed a federal agency's decision allowing the city to resume digging a ditch around its reservoir to divert a stream allegedly contaminated at the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant `` I'm elated,'' City Manager <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> DiCiero </PERSON> said after learning of the decision by the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> DiCiero </PERSON> said work on the ditch would resume today. Meanwhile, Gov. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Romer </PERSON> said he won assurance in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, from <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION>, that the federal government would give the state what it needs to conduct its own environmental testing at Rocky Flats. `` The purpose of the meeting was to deliver a message that they either have to clean it up or close it,'' <PERSON> Romer </PERSON> said of the plant, which processes plutonium for nuclear weapons. `` The response I got from Adm. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> and his officials was absolute cooperation.'' <PERSON> Romer </PERSON> said he also wants state workers to monitor the handling of the hazardous waste at Rocky Flats, rather than relying on the DOE. `` I intend to put in place the kind of monitoring where we do n't need to rely on anybody else We're going to have independent verification,'' <PERSON> Romer </PERSON> said. Last Tuesday, 75 <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents and <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> investigators raided the plant as part of a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> investigation into allegations of fraudulent disposal and burning of hazardous materials at the site. An affidavit made public last week charged that hazardous chemicals were dumped illegally into creeks at Rocky Flats last November. The affidavit said the DOE, which owns the plant, and <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which operates it, tried to conceal the illegal disposal of wastes. Following the allegations, <PERSON> Broomfield </PERSON> last week began digging a diversion ditch and building an earthen dam to divert <LOCATION> Walnut </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Walnut </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> flows out of Rocky Flats into <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reservoir </LOCATION>, which supplies half of <PERSON> Broomfield </PERSON>'s drinking water. The creek provides about 5 percent of the water needs of this <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> suburb of 27,600 residents. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> had halted the work over the weekend, saying the city needed federal permits. But <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> officials on Monday gave a go-ahead after meeting with city and federal officials and visiting the site. `` The flow in the river is an absolute trickle,'' said <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodson </PERSON>, director of water management for the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> office. `` The size of the stream and of the impacted area is not that significant.'' <PERSON> Dodson </PERSON> said a letter of confirmation that the work could proceed would be sent to the city by the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION>. `` We want to do the diversion so we can have peace of mind and tell our residents the water is safe,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> DiCiero </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Broomfield </LOCATION> city manager. The state <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said samples taken over the weekend of drinking water in <LOCATION> Broomfield </LOCATION> and other communities were not contaminated by any of 59 organic substances typically analyzed in checking drinking water. However, the state still was testing for 13 other chemicals cited by federal investigators in their probe of Rocky Flats. Results were expected later in the week, department assistant director <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Looby </PERSON> said. `` We are confident that these initial tests indicate that the likelihood of any of the 13 chemicals being found in these drinking water supplies is very, very small,'' <PERSON> Looby </PERSON> said.

 Officials will be watching this summmer to see if new vapor control nozzles at gasoline stations noticeably improve air quality in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, the second state to require the devices. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> officials imposed the regulations Jan. 1 on the state's larger stations, hoping to decrease harmful ozone pollution by between 3 percent and 5 percent to meet standards set by the federal Clean Air Act. The state's smaller stations must comply by next year. Legislation to enact gasoline vapor control programs is pending in statehouses in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Becker </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> and Territorial Air Pollution Program Administrators in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. But he said he would prefer national legislation to make the laws uniform. `` We would prefer that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> mandate it. What we have learned in the Clean Air Act debate is that no progress is made and in fact things just get worse unless we adopt innovative technology,'' he said. The nozzles, which look like small black accordions, are designed to capture vapors normally emitted by gasoline when it is pumped into an automobile. A vapor-lock system routes the vapors back into the station's underground holding tanks, where it reverts to liquid form. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> follows <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> in enacting vapor control regulations. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> has had the nozzles since Jan. 1, 1988. Also, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> and several <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> cities have similar laws. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Elston </PERSON>, assistant director of air quality management at the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION>, called the new nozzles a start in cleaning the air. `` This regulation moves us one step closer to the real problem: the motoring public,'' he said. Many service station owners have opposed the new nozzles. `` We're not trying to stand in the way of progress, but we've made a big capital outlay to comply with this for a very small improvement in air quality,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Holtz </PERSON>, associate director of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> The council estimated the nozzles cost an average of $ 29,000 per station. <PERSON> Rolando </PERSON> <PERSON> Idal </PERSON>, a gas station attendant at a busy Gulf station on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Highway 1 & amp; 9 in <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>, does n't like the new system for another reason. Laboring between a truck belching exhaust fumes and a car whose gas tank resisted the bulky nozzle, he said, `` Maybe it helps the air, but they make it very hard to work. They click off at the wrong time, they scratch up the cars, and the people think it's my fault.''

 After a fruitless search last year, the <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> battleship <PERSON> Bismarck </PERSON> has been found on the ocean floor 600 miles off the coast of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, 48 years after it was sunk by the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. The Bismarck was located Monday under 15,000 feet of water by a remote-controlled robot named <PERSON> Argo </PERSON> that scuttles across the ocean floor. <PERSON> Argo </PERSON> and his master, expedition leader Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON>, also discovered the sunken Titanic four years ago. The Bismarck was sitting upright on the sea floor `` intact in an excellent state of preservation'' about 600 miles west of <LOCATION> Brest </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Brittany </LOCATION> coast, said <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON>, who is based at <ORGANIZATION> Woods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hole </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanographic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> on <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cod </LOCATION>. The discovery is likely to trigger great curiosity among naval historians, said Maj. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Neimeyer </PERSON>, a history professor at the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Naval Academy. `` They'll be looking for the sort of technology the Germans had at the time, because this ship was considered state-of-the-art,'' he said. The find could answer questions about the way the ship went down and `` how the crew lived and survived at sea on a German warship,'' he added. No human remains were found near the <LOCATION> Bismarck </LOCATION>, on which all but about 100 of the 2,200 crew members perished. A memorial service for those who perished was held aboard one of the expedition's ships. The ship will be left undisturbed as a grave site, like the Titanic, according to <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON>, assistant director of the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exploration </ORGANIZATION> at Woods Hole. The battleship might be explored by the sophisticated robot, though, <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON> and a research team searched several days for the Bismarck last year. Instead of the <PERSON> Bismarck </PERSON>, the explorers found a 19th century sailing ship that has yet to be identified, <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON> said. `` There were quite a few reports about its position when it sank,'' <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON> said. `` But the problem is, those reports can be off by a mile or more, and a mile at sea, when you're looking at the sea floor, represents a very large area to be covered in a search.'' The demise of the dreaded <LOCATION> Bismarck </LOCATION>, which was equipped with eight 15-inch guns, began on May 24, 1941, when it encountered the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> off the coast of <LOCATION> Greenland </LOCATION>. The Bismarck sank <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s battle cruiser Hood but was hit by the Prince of <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION>. The Germans then fled south for occupied <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> with the British in pursuit. Two days later, British warships and aircraft located the crippled vessel and launched a furious attack. The Bismarck finally went down the next day. The successful campaign was a significant victory for the Allies, who thwarted <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s plan to use the <LOCATION> Bismarck </LOCATION> to raid <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> shipping lanes. <PERSON> Neimeyer </PERSON> said the victory also gave a big psychological boost to the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, which was stunned by the loss of the Hood. `` Tis gave confidence to the carrier-aviation community that they could indeed sink a battleship,'' he said. The expedition was jointly funded by <ORGANIZATION> Turner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and a group of private investors. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geographic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> plans to produce a documentary on the discovery that will be televised next fall.

<HEAD>Dollar Keeps Rising Against Yen, Stocks Decline</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar continued its rise against the Japanese yen Tuesday, causing a further decline in stock prices, dealers said. The dollar gained 0.30 yen, closing at 148.70 yen, its highest level since Aug. 17, 1987, when it closed at 150.20 yen. On Monday, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency shot up 4.90 yen to 148.40 yen. After opening Tuesday at 148.80 yen, the dollar ranged between 148.45 and 149.75 yen. On the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the 225-issue <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION> fell 184.46 points, or 0.55 percent, closing at 33,213.55. The index dropped 241.97 points on Monday. A dealer at the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity, said continued dollar-buying was linked to a `` flight to quality'' by investors. `` It is not that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> itself is unstable, but to investors, the dollar is still safer,'' he said. He said the violent suppression of demonstrators in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, a major trading partner of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, was one reason for investors' flight from the yen. Nevertheless, he said even if the dollar exceeds 150 yen, there wo n't be a large impact on <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. `` There is very little possibility that prices will rise,'' he said. The dealer also said the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> intervened several times during the day in support of the yen, selling $ 1 billion in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency. The intervention helped to stop dollar-buying when the currency neared the 150-yen level, he said, adding that dealers also began profit-taking. The falling yen has discouraged stock purchases on the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> exchange, said an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>, also speaking on condition of anonymity. No stock received particular attention during the day's trading, in which only 500 million shares were traded, he said.

 Some Chinese students who participated in Canadian demonstrations protesting the massacre of students in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> say their families have been placed under house arrest in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. About 15 students told parliamentarian <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Karygiannis </PERSON> on Monday that they fear for their families and for their lives if they return to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` I'm scared and worried about my family,'' said one English language student. `` I do n't know if I will ever be able to see them again, but I will continue demonstrating because the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> people do not have any freedom.''

The students said they sent their families photographs of themselves protesting against the June 3-4 military assault in central <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and newspaper clippings about unrest in the Chinese capital. Police and customs officials opened the packages, said the students, who did not want to be identified because they feared further reprisals.

<HEAD>Cowles: Newspaper Technological Advances to Continue</HEAD>

 In the past 30 years, newspapers have gone from typewriters and popping flashbulbs to computers and electronic darkrooms, but even more technological advances are ahead, said newspaper publisher <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowles </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. `` That was good progress,'' <PERSON> Cowles </PERSON>, president and publisher of the <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, Spokesman-Review and the <ORGANIZATION> Spokane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chronicle </ORGANIZATION>, told the 61st annual meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> on Monday. <PERSON> Cowles </PERSON> is chairman of the association. `` Today's ` protocol for progress,' however, demands that we focus not what's behind our taillights, but rather on what's in front of our headlights,'' he said. The APNA convention is being held in conjunction with displays of futuristic technology, and its theme is `` Protocols for Progress.'' `` Every year we have a little clutch of fear that our technology is about to plateau; and every year it does n't. This means we just have time to take a deep breath before we have to start learning again.'' In addition to 300 displays of the latest technology, there will be workshops on the newest production, administration, sales techniques and news gathering techniques discussed in workshop sessions. The convention ends on Wednesday. <PERSON> Reg </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, the publisher and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> blamed a 10 percent drop in newspaper readership over the past several years on illiteracy, competition with other news media and competition for readers' time. `` People who ca n't read do n't buy newspapers,'' <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said Monday. The fight for literacy was one example <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> gave of the sort of community involvement newspapers should have if they are to compete successfully for readers and advertising money. `` The toughest competition in our game is for the time of our readers,'' he said. `` You wo n't find many women lingering over the newspaper with their coffee anymore,'' he said. `` They might like to, but they have corporations to run and surgery to perform.''

<TEXT>
 Syrian and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> forces fought with tanks and recoilless rifles in hills southeast of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> today, dampening hopes that <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> efforts would swiftly end the latest outbreak in the 14-year civil war. A spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> army commander <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> said Syrian gunners were shelling his forces' positions in hills around the mountain town of <LOCATION> Souk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> el-Gharb </LOCATION> as well as in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> suburbs of <LOCATION> Kfarshima </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Hadath </PERSON>. He said the Syrians were shelling from positions in the village of <LOCATION> Aitat </LOCATION>, opposite Souk el-Gharb, and from the suburb of <LOCATION> Choueifat </LOCATION>. The spokesman accused the Syrians of starting the barrage as Arab League Assistant Secretary General <PERSON> Lakhdar </PERSON> <PERSON> Ibrahimi </PERSON> crossed <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s dividing <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> for talks with Gen. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> leaders in east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> `` They shelled us with tank cannons and recoilless rifles. We are responding in kind,'' said the spokesman on condition of anonymity. He accused the Syrians of provoking the fighting to `` foil efforts by <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> leaders to work out a solid cease-fire.'' Shortly before dawn, Syrian howitzer batteries deployed in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> fired 20 shells at the coastline north of the city in an apparent effort to maintain a blockade of Christian ports. Police said the 130mm shells exploded around the ports of Byblos and <LOCATION> Jounieh </LOCATION>. No casualties were reported. The renewed shelling after a two-day lull contrasted sharply with reports in <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> media that a cease-fire agreement had been worked out by <PERSON> Ibrahimi </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, the Syrian capital. The pro-Syrian daily paper As-Safir reported in its main story today that `` an air of optimism prevails over the situation in light of Ibrahimi's talks.'' <LOCATION> Ibrahimi </LOCATION> arrived in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> on Monday. He held talks in the city's Moslem sector with <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s rival as head of the Moslem cabinet in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s dual government. In <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ibrahimi </PERSON> met over the weekend with President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> and his foreign minister, <PERSON> Farouk </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Sharaa </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> has 40,000 troops in predominantly Moslem sectors of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> extending from the northern <LOCATION> Akkar </LOCATION> plain across the eastern <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> valley to west and south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The official Syrian news agency, <ORGANIZATION> SANA </ORGANIZATION>, quoted <PERSON> al-Sharaa </PERSON> as saying the <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> talks centered on `` the need for the warring Lebanese factions to reach agreement on the mechanism for lifting blockades, reopening crossing points and making the cease-fire comprehensive.'' The current round of violence broke out March 8, two days after <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> blockaded illegal ports run by Syrian-backed militias south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in order to salvage lost customs dues of around $ 100 million annually. The Syrians and their Moslem militia allies retaliated by blockading the 310-square-mile Christian enclave northeast of the capital that is home to 1 million Christians. At least 367 people have been killed and 1,432 wounded in the confrontation, by police count. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> has agreed to previous <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> calls that he should lift the blockade. The Syrians, however, have refused to call off their siege of the Christian enclave to prevent <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> from obtaining Iraqi-shipped war materiel.

 Federal investigators probing embezzlement in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> want to question a lawyer about the disappearance of $ 3 million in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> area, a newspaper reported. <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, who has been missing for about a year, is wanted for questioning in the probe of <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> field office, which administers federal housing programs in the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> and its <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> suburbs, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> reported today. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> was a closing agent who represented <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> at settlement when it sold houses in the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. He worked for the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> office at the same time as <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> real estate agent <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrell </PERSON>, who allegedly embezzled $ 5.5 million as a closing agent for the department in the <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> suburbs. Ms. <PERSON> Harrell </PERSON>, who has not been charged, has admitted taking the funds and claimed she gave the money to charities. Because of that investigators have nicknamed her `` Robin <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>.'' The Sun reported that neither <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Harrell </PERSON> were bonded as a precaution against theft or loss. `` It's another example of incredible carelessness,'' the newspaper quoted a senior <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> official as saying. `` The <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> office was in a state of total disarray.'' Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported today that <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> this week will begin a systematic review of property sales, demanding that 53 field offices explain what happened to any unaccounted-for proceeds, according to a memo from Secretary <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said the content of the memo was disclosed by a senior <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> official who estimated that as much as $ 100 million may be unaccounted for. The source based the estimate on the early findings of audits of 11 field offices, the newspaper reported. The <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> probe is one of several being conducted throughout the country. In <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, a closing agent has been indicted in connection with the theft of $ 2.5 million in <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> funds. Probes also are underway in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials were able to provide little information about <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, The Sun reported. Motor vehicle records showed <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> lived in <LOCATION> Potomac </LOCATION>, Md. Neighbors said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> ran into financial trouble and sold his house last year, the newspaper reported. Ms. <PERSON> Harrell </PERSON> said Monday she was glad the embezzlement was finally discovered. `` It really got out of hand,'' she said in an interview at her Camp Spring, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, home. `` I'm not at all proud of it. I'm really glad it's out in the open. To carry this inside is so difficult. Why try to say I did n't do it? I did it and I'm not proud of it at all.'' Ms. <PERSON> Harrell </PERSON> said she used the <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> money in the past four years to fund a variety of charities in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> and suburban <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that serve the homeless, drug addicts, suicidal teens and the elderly. `` I was just drawn into it,'' she said. `` HUD does n't serve the poor. There's no way they serve the poor. They dispossess the poor and I think that's unconscionable.''

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> is apologizing, but consumers say it's pretty cheesy that the food maker called off a promotional contest in which thousands of consumers stood to win a new van The `` Ready to Roll'' contest required consumers to match the right half of game pieces carried in advertisements in Sunday newspapers with left-sided pieces inserted in packages of specially marked <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> Singles cheese slices. The ads ran in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> areas. <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> planned to give away one <ORGANIZATION> Dodge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caravan </ORGANIZATION>, valued at $ 17,000; 100 bicycles; 500 skateboards; and 8,000 packages of <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> Singles. According to the company, the odds of winning the van were 1 in 15.2 million. But because of an error by the printer of the game pieces inside the cheese packages, it is likely that `` thousands and thousands'' would have won the van, said <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Knuth </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the foodmaker based in suburban <LOCATION> Glenview </LOCATION>. `` Instead of only a limited number of winning game pieces,'' a company statement read, `` essentially all of the game pieces appear to be winning ones.'' <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> declared the contest null and void and pulled packages of Singles from stores in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. `` The company regrets any confusion this promotion may have caused,'' <PERSON> Knuth </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Radical students calling for the overthrow of President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo today battled riot police with firebombs and stones after holding rallies to denounce a government crackdown on dissidents. Clashes between police and protesters broke out at six <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> colleges while peaceful protests were held at six other campuses. Riot police in green combat fatigues and visored helmets ringed all the colleges to stop protesters from marching into the streets. The clashes came amid conflicting reports that <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> intends to shuffle his Cabinet and remove senior ministers he believes have not performed effectively. About 300 protesters, some of them armed with wooden clubs and iron pipes, battled police with firebombs at <ORGANIZATION> Sogang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in western <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> after the students marched out of the campus beating drums and waving flags. Hundreds of riot troopers blocked nearby streets and hurled rocks at the students but did not use tear gas. Students hurling rocks battled riot police at nearby <ORGANIZATION> Yonsei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> after they were blocked from marching out. `` Beat <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo to death!'' and `` Oust <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo!'' students chanted. Police said they had no reports of arrests or serious injuries. Student leaders, speaking at campus rallies, denounced the government for a crackdown in recent weeks on dissident groups and demanded the release of scores of jailed dissident leaders. Police carried out the crackdown to curb a recent wave of violent protests. The violent campus clashes were the largest in recent weeks. Some radical students said in May they would stop using firebombs after seven riot police were killed in a demonstration. But student groups have started to use firebombs and other weapons again. Thousands of students battled police in running street clashes in central <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> on Saturday, and more than 1,000 people were arrested. The radicals and alllied dissident groups are calling for <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s ouster and demanding to take part in a youth festival in <LOCATION> Communist </LOCATION> <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> next month The government has banned their participation because of its bitter rivalry with the North. The radicals have little public support because of their violent tactics and extremist views. South Korean news reports today said <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> was considering removing some Cabinet ministers who have failed to carry out their tasks or been linked to unpopular policies. There have been persistent reports for weeks of Cabinet changes. The administration had no comment on the reports. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> announced last week he would not keep an election promise to hold a midterm referendum on his performance. He said a referendum would generate political unrest, but some opposition groups are demanding a vote. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>, a former army general, won presidential elections in late 1987.

<TEXT>
 In a setback for the prosecution, a witness today changed his story in court and supported the alibi of a friend _ the man accused of killing Prime Minister <PERSON> Olof </PERSON> <PERSON> Palme </PERSON>. The testimony came during the second week of the trial of <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Gustaf </PERSON> <PERSON> Christer </PERSON> <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON>, who is accused of shooting Palme to death in 1986 as the four-term Swedish leader was walking home with his wife from a movie. Witness <PERSON> Ulf </PERSON> <PERSON> Stinnars </PERSON>, 35, claimed police interrogators had hinted that he could be eligible for the 50 million kronor -LRB- $ 8 million -RRB- reward if his testimony about <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON>'s whereabouts after the shooting was helpful. `` The police tried to coax me with money. They said, ` 50 million, 50 million,''' Stinnars told the court. Stinnars, led into the courtroom between two policemen, wore a tattered jeans jacket and jogging pants and refused to remove his baseball cap and sunglasses, apparently to keep his face hidden from courtroom artists. He also refused to speak until the court agreed that his testimony would not be broadcast on national radio. Previous sessions have been broadcast. After a 15-minute recess, Chief Magistrate <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> af </PERSON> <PERSON> Geijerstam </PERSON> ordered the radio not to transmit from the courtroom. <PERSON> Stinnars </PERSON> was called by the prosecution to repeat his story that <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON> returned to his suburban apartment about 12:30 or 1 a.m. on the night of the shooting, countering <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON>'s alibi. But <PERSON> Stinners </PERSON> withdrew that story in court, saying he now believed the defendant had been home before midnight on Feb. 28, 1986. If true, it would mean <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON> could not have shot Palme in downtown <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION> at 11:23 p.m. `` I ca n't remember. I've thought about this for three months and I do n't want to lie here, so I ca n't say I'm sure,'' <PERSON> Stinnars </PERSON> said. He acknowledged that he had spoken with <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON> about the hour <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON> returned, but denied his friend had intimidated him to change his story. <PERSON> Stinnars </PERSON> also said he was taking drugs when he was first questioned by police, and his memory was impaired. He said he waited at the apartment while <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON> went into town to get a supply of drugs. They often got drunk and used drugs together, he testified. <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON>, 42, who has a police record of more than 60 crimes, including a manslaughter conviction, has pleaded innocent. On Wednesday, the prosecution is expected to call its key witness, <PERSON> Lisbet </PERSON> <PERSON> Palme </PERSON>, who is expected to identify <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON> as the man she saw fleeing after her husband was shot. In an adjoining room of the <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, the former <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION> police commissioner who led the initial murder investigation was acquitted today of charges of disclosing secret information about the investigation. The court found that <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmer </PERSON> had not violated secrecy or libel laws in his 1988 book `` Palme Is Shot,'' in which he described the surveillance of suspects and disclosed the identity of witnesses. <PERSON> Holmer </PERSON> was fired in February 1987.

<HEAD>Birmingham Mayor Says Ruling is a Setback for Civil Rights</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Affirmative Action, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The mayor says a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision enabling white firefighters to challenge the city's racially tailored hiring plan is a setback for civil rights `` Certainly it's part of what I think is a carefully designed plan to turn the clock back on affirmative action, period, everywhere,'' Mayor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Arrington </PERSON>, the city's first black mayor, said after the ruling Monday. `` We're very, very disappointed. ... It's going to be a long, hot summer.'' <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzpatrick </PERSON>, a lawyer for the city's firefighters union, said the decision is a step toward ending race-based policies that hurt white workers. In its 5-4 decision, the high court held that the affirmative action plan approved by the city and a lower court is open to challenge by workers who took no part in the case that led to the agreement. The case is expected to go to trial in federal court, but no date has been set. Fire Chief <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallant </PERSON> declined to comment on the decision. A civil rights attorney said <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>'s history makes it ideal for testing affirmative action. In the 1960s, segregated <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> was the site of civil rights protests in which police used firehoses and dogs against demonstrators, many of them children. News coverage of the protests galvanized the civil rights movement. `` You would have to ignore several hundred years of <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> history to find there was n't sufficient record'' to warrant affirmative action here, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Joffe </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> for the Advancement of Colored People. <PERSON> Joffe </PERSON>, in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said the decision `` is just another, unfortunately, in a too long line of recent cases in which the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has put up roadblocks in the way of affirmative action.'' The case began in 1974 when the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> and blacks filed a lawsuit charging racial bias in the Fire Department. Both sides eventually agreed on a plan for hiring and promoting minorities. Seven white firefighters challenged the plan, saying less-qualified blacks were being promoted ahead of them. A federal judge ruled the white firefighters must abide by the consent decree. But a federal appeals court in 1987 reinstated the lawsuit, and the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> agreed. Lt. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Brush </PERSON>, president of the union local, said many whites have left the department after being passed over for promotions by blacks with less seniority. <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>'s population of 276,000 is about 55 percent black and 45 percent white. Of 497 firefighters, 379, or 76 percent, are white and 118, or 24 percent, are black. Of 151 officers, 38, or 25 percent, are black.

<TEXT>
 Former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> urged the West today to take risks with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, saying he was `` the Soviets' best and probably only hope to turn things around.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also declared that the Chinese government `` has n't learned something very elementary: you ca n't massacre an idea. You can not run tanks over hope. You can not riddle a people's yearning with bullets.'' In a speech on his first visit to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> since stepping down as president, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> painted a sweeping picture of a world gripped by an information revolution in which computers and satellite dishes would inevitably dissolve the barriers between East and West and democracy would supplant communism. `` I believe <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is the Soviets' best and probably only hope to turn things around,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` It is true that the West could stand pat while this is happening. We are not the ones who must change. It is not our people who're isolated from the information that allows them to be creative and productive,'' he said. `` But it is exactly when you are strong and comfortable that you should take risks.'' He said: `` I believe we should take the risk that the Soviets are serious in their efforts to reach genuine arms reductions with the West. I support President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal to keep pressure on the Soviets to make good on their calls to reduce arms.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was addressing an array of dignitaries of the English Speaking Union at the Guildhall, the ornate 1,000-year-old seat of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s civic government, where 13 months ago he gave a speech en route home after visiting <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, who is in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> this week for his first state visit to that country, spoke at Guildhall in April. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said `` I'm more optimistic than ever in my life about peace and democracy in this world.'' He said `` amazing things are afoot in the world this spring.'' `` Those heroic <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> students who gave their lives have released the spirit of democracy and it can not be called back,'' he said, referring to the student-led movement for a freer <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government's violent crackdown on it. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, he said, was dismantling part of its barbed-wire border fence with <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> and moving to multi-party democracy; <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> had legalized the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> and held its most open elections in 40 years; dissident <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> now sits in the Soviet parliament. Communist countries were still trying to suppress the free flow of information by restricting the use of photocopying machines, typewriters, TV satellite dishes and cross-border computer linkups, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. But `` the biggest of <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> is increasingly helpless against communications technology,'' he said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, arrived quietly on Sunday for a four-day visit, and were to dine with Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> and have lunch with Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> on Wednesday. Prince <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, her son and heir, has invited the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> for drinks. On Monday, <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>'s Peerage said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has been offered an honorary knighthood and has accepted the highest royal honor <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> bestows on Americans. But Buckingham Palace and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s press spokesman, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberg </PERSON>, refused comment on the report. British honors are formally awarded by the queen although most are made on the recommendation of Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>.

 Friends of a judge who was shot to death in her chambers by her estranged husband took comfort when he was sentenced to two life terms. The trial of 53-year-old former policeman <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> Ratliff </PERSON> caused outrage last month when he was convicted of manslaughter instead of murder for killing District Judge <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Irons </PERSON> on Oct. 19. `` I think our message was heard,'' said <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Smolenski </PERSON>, a friend of Irons who organized a petition drive and letter campaign calling for the maximum sentence. <PERSON> Ratliff </PERSON> on Monday was given the maximum 10 to 15 years for voluntary manslaughter and two life terms _ the maximum _ for assault with intent to murder for shooting at officers who tried to help the mortally wounded <PERSON> Irons </PERSON>. Neither officer was hit. The sentences will run concurrently. <PERSON> Ratliff </PERSON> will be eligible for parole in 10 years. A murder conviction could have resulted in life without parole. <PERSON> Irons </PERSON>' friends and relatives hugged outside the courtroom after the sentencing. Circuit Judge <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolenda </PERSON> said community sentiment played a part in his decision to exceed sentencing guidelines calling for seven to 15 years for assault with intent to murder. He also said the site of the crime and <PERSON> Ratliff </PERSON>'s position compounded the seriousness of the slaying. `` By resolving your dispute in the most violent way known to human nature, by doing it in the place where peaceful resolution is always supposed to happen, you struck close to a mortal blow to the peace ... of this community,'' <PERSON> Kolenda </PERSON> told <PERSON> Ratliff </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ratliff </PERSON> had contended he did n't plan to kill <PERSON> Irons </PERSON> but was drunk and angry about a property dispute in their divorce proceedings. Before the sentencing, friends, family and co-workers of <PERSON> Irons </PERSON>, 40, addressed the court, criticizing the law that allowed <PERSON> Ratliff </PERSON> and defense witnesses to discuss <PERSON> Irons </PERSON>' alleged extramarital affairs. `` As the trial went on and <PERSON> Carol </PERSON>'s character was assassinated daily. ... I waited and waited for some sign of remorse on the part of the defendant,'' said <PERSON> Nora </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrier </PERSON> <PERSON> Potts </PERSON>. <PERSON> Potts </PERSON> said she hoped the sentence would eliminate society's acceptance of `` the little boy excuse of ` I could n't help it She made me mad.'''

 Southern Baptists put off a proposal to set up a conservative lobbying group in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, clearing the decks for the election today of a president of the nation's largest Protestant denomination. The denomination's Executive Committee voted unanimously Monday to wait until next year's convention to recommend creation of a <ORGANIZATION> Religious </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to lobby on issues such as school prayer and tuition tax credits. That left the election between 44-year-old <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Vestal </PERSON>, pastor of <ORGANIZATION> Dunwoody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in suburban <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, and incumbent <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Vines </PERSON>, 51, pastor of <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, as the only major issue of the convention. Vines asked the Executive Committee to postpone the proposal for a <ORGANIZATION> Religious </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> in the interests of `` a peaceful convention meeting and a positive witness'' in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>. But the battle lines continued to be drawn as moderates hoped to reverse a decade-long string of conservative victories in presidential elections. `` I think the Southern Baptist Convention is in serious condition, serious trouble,'' said <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Vestal </PERSON>, the moderate candidate for the presidency. `` A lot of people are at the point of dropping out.'' The 14.8 million-member denomination has more than doubled its membership in the past quarter-century, but has grown by barely more than half a percent in each of the last two years. The convention presidency is considered a critical post because the officer appoints the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committees </ORGANIZATION>, which has a central role in selecting people for the convention's boards, commissions and committees. Vines is scheduled to address the convention prior to the election today, while <PERSON> Vestal </PERSON> appealed to delegates Sunday and Monday evenings in half-hour programs on a local television station paid for by his supporters. Also Monday, <ORGANIZATION> PBS </ORGANIZATION> reporter <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Moyers </PERSON> withdrew a request to appear before the executive committee to discuss its criticism of his `` God and Politics'' documentary. The committee in February said the documentary was biased in support of Southern Baptist moderates. <PERSON> Moyers </PERSON> said in a letter to the committee that he realized `` I am up against a situation most un-Baptist: closed minds, and in the parlance of your host city, a stacked deck.'' In other pre-convention business, a conservative pastor, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Elliff </PERSON>, pastor of <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in suburban <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, was elected president of the 6,000-member <ORGANIZATION> SBC </ORGANIZATION> Pastor's Conference The central issues in the debate between the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> moderates and conservatives cross over theological and political boundaries. Conservatives accuse moderates of being open to biblical interpretations that challenge the foundations of Southern Baptist faith. But the moderates charge conservatives with violating another central belief of <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Baptists </LOCATION> _ that individuals are able to interpret the Bible for themselves. The issues have engendered passionate debate. But <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Pressler </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> judge who has helped rally conservatives to 10 straight presidential victories since 1979, said even if the moderates win the presidential election, the war is over. `` The course correction has been made,'' he said.

<HEAD>Retail Sales Edged Up 0.1 Percent in May</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Retail sales rose a sluggish 0.1 percent in May, held down by a big decline in department store revenues and a slowdown in movement of automobiles off dealers' lots, the government reported today. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said sales climbed to a seasonally adjusted $ 141.1 billion last month after rising 1 percent in April. The April figure had been revised upward from 0.4 percent. Sales had fallen 0.4 percent in February and risen 0.1 percent in March. Economists had anticipated a weak sales increase of about 0.2 percent in May. Major retailers reported sluggish sales that month as interest rates remained near their early-spring peak. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> paused recently in its efforts to push rates up to slow the economy and dampen inflation, and rates have begun to fall slightly. Auto sales slowed to a 0.2 percent rise in May following a strong 2 percent rise in April. In both months, carmakers had offered incentives such as rebates and low interest rates to lure buyers into showrooms. Auto sales in the first five months of 1989 were 2.3 percent higher than those during the same period last year. That was less than the rate of inflation. Autos represent about 20 percent of total retail sales. Excluding the automotive category, sales rose 0.1 percent following a hike of 0.7 percent in April and a 0.1 percent decrease in March. Department and other general merchandise stores and specialty clothing shops accounted for much of the slower sales pace. Sales of general merchandise fell 1.2 percent and clothing shops dropped 1.4 percent. Sales of durable goods, `` big ticket'' items expected to last more than three years, rose 0.3 percent after rising 1.8 percent in April largely on the strength of auto sales. Non-durable goods sales were flat following an increase of 0.6 percent in April. The following categories also reported sales increases in May: food and grocery stores, 0.5 percent; gasoline stations, 0.9 percent; and drug stores, 1.8 percent. Categories posting declines included bars and restaurants, down 0.4 percent. Building materials and furniture sales were flat. For the three months from March through May, overall retail sales were up 5.1 percent from the same period in 1988.

 He may have been half a hemisphere away, but there was one thing back home in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that did not slip the mind of Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s birthday is something I could not forget,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said Monday as he sat in the luxurious hilltop residence of <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Briggs </PERSON>. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> had a good reason for remembering the occasion despite a day filled with plane, helicopter and motorcade trips across two countries and a myriad of meetings that focused on the region. `` Because it also happens to be my mother's birthday,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. He said he cabled birthday greetings to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for the president. But his 67-year-old mother, <PERSON> Corinne </PERSON>, had to wait for her son's birthday wish. The vice president said he had tried to reach her but did n't know where she was.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s family was also on his mind Monday as his motorcade sped through <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The vice president called the motorcade to a halt in front of a small, open-air store and went on a short shopping spree as a crowd of onlookers gathered. The saleswoman showed him T-shirts and a peasant skirt, but <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> had his eye on the store's assortment of soccer balls. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> bought one, saying his children _ <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>, <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Corinne </PERSON> _ were very good at the sport. But he tried it out first on the crowd out on the sidewalk, tossing it to one lad, who deftly returned it each time with his head. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> then threw the ball into a crowd of adults who scrambled all over it. `` I'll never see that,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> laughed in an aside, apparently thinking he would not get the ball back. But sure enough it popped into the air, tossed right to him as he entered his limo.

 <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s visit to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military training installation at <ORGANIZATION> Soto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cano </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> caused considerable interest among the service members who are restricted to the base for their training. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> reviewed the troops, dressed in camouflage fatigues, then headed to the rustic wooden mess hall for a cafeteria lunch of beef, potatoes and salad. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> had 20 men sitting on either side of him. How were these soldiers selected from the 1,200 at the base? Army chaplain <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Causey </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, said he won the privilege of sitting at the head of the table because he happened to be the only chaplain. The others were commanders and `` soldier of the month'' winners. Soldiers of the month are selected from each service _ <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and Marines _ on the basis of an academic test, according to <PERSON> Causey </PERSON>. The soldiers are tested on such skills as mathematics and other school subjects, he said.

 Educators here have drawn the line against naming a school for the <LOCATION> Alamo </LOCATION> hero <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Barret </PERSON> <PERSON> Travis </PERSON>. The problem: skeletons in his closet. It turns out the man who drew the famous line in the dirt during the defense of the chapel-fort in 1836 abandoned his wife and child and owned slaves. <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> school trustees voted Monday night to name the school instead after black educator <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Branch </PERSON>, the first woman college president in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Countless schools and streets in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> are named for <PERSON> Travis </PERSON>. In fact, the school named for Branch will replace <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Travis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, which will close next year. <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> is a town of 59,000 about 60 miles from <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. During the siege of the <LOCATION> Alamo </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Travis </PERSON> wrote an appeal for help. Legend also has it that when the defenders were surrounded by Mexican troops, he drew a line and asked those willing to die for freedom to cross it with him. Trustee <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON> <PERSON> Costa </PERSON> pointed out that <PERSON> Travis </PERSON> had abandoned his family. Noting also that <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>'s population is 22 percent black, she asked, `` How can we even consider naming a school after someone who was so strongly in favor of slavery?'' <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Calvert </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Historical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> described <PERSON> Travis </PERSON> as a `` ne'er - do-well who in two weeks' time happened to do something wonderful `` All of my life I've been told that <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Barret </PERSON> <PERSON> Travis </PERSON> is the greatest <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> hero,'' said Trustee <PERSON> Travis </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> `` No power on earth can convince me he's not, not even <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON> <PERSON> Costa </PERSON>.'' `` The name of <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Barret </PERSON> <PERSON> Travis </PERSON> must be sustained.

 Civil rights advocates seeking to prevent affirmative action programs from being rolled back are shifting their sights to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> following a series of major setbacks in the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. `` It is just not possible for civil rights advocates to do business in federal courts any more,'' <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Galloway </PERSON>, a professor at the <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clara </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, said Monday. <PERSON> Galloway </PERSON> and others commented after the high court ruled 5-4 that white firefighters in <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, are entitled to bring suit to attack an affirmative action plan approved eight years ago to settle a lawsuit. The white firefighters were not a party to the lawsuit and say they should not be governed by a settlement in which they had no say. The decision was the latest in a series of high court decisions chipping away at affirmative action programs, which have been used to give hiring and promotion preference to minorities and women. Civil rights groups contend the programs are necessary to compensate for years of past discrimination, but the high court's conservative majority is showing a new concern over the issue of reverse discrimination The court ruled in January that state and local governments may generally not impose racial quotas for hiring on public works projects. And on June 5, the justices made it more difficult for minorities to prove statistically that they are being relegated to less desirable jobs. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzpatrick </PERSON>, an attorney representing the white firemen in <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>, said Monday's ruling is a step toward ending `` race-based quota promotions'' that unfairly discriminate against whites. `` In our view the one-for-one black and white promotions that <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> has been following for eight years are not legal under the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Constitution,'' <PERSON> Fitzpatrick </PERSON> said today on `` CBS This Morning.'' `` ... They're excessive. The black population at the firefighter entry level is about 10 to 13 percent, yet 50 percent of the promotions are going to blacks.'' Civil rights and women's groups, however, say they may ask <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to reverse the high court rulings. `` I think a legislative remedy is something that is probably going to be pursued,'' said <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Winston </PERSON>, a lawyer for the Women's Legal Defense Fund, `` The time may have come to again go to the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and attempt to get the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to overrule what the court has done in the civil rights area,'' said <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> `` I think it is indispensable at this point that the battle be taken to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Galloway </PERSON>, who specializes in affirmative action law. Rep. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, D-Calif., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on civil rights, said he was saddened by the court's decision and added, `` We'll have to take a look at it'' with an eye to possible `` This decision will open old wounds and create unfortunate new levels of racial animosity,'' <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said. Already, he said, his staff has been meeting with civil rights groups and professors about the June 5 decision. He said legislation would be introduced and hearings probably held soon. The last major congressional debate on civil rights was touched off by a high court decision in 1984 that placed limits on laws barring federal aid to schools and other institutions that discriminate. Legislation restoring the original broader interpretation of the laws was passed over former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto last year after a long struggle President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> so far has been noncommittal on the issue of affirmative action, which was strongly opposed by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. After the court's June 5 decision on statistical evidence, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in response to a question that the ruling was still being studied but `` sometimes you can ... take remedy in suggested legislation.'' Some observers said they think <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> might be more amenable than <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was to legislative action in the civil rights field. `` I think the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is more concerned about reaching out to the black community than the past administration was,'' said <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Aleinikoff </PERSON>, a professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> who follows civil rights cases closely. Said <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clara </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s Galloway: `` They have n't taken a clear stance on affirmative action yet, but I hope they may be somewhat more moderate.''

 The army said it blew up a house in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> today and sealed two others in a crackdown on Palestinians suspected of throwing firebombs at troops and attacking Arabs who cooperate with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Another house was sealed near <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> because concrete blocks were thrown at soliders from its roof, the army said. Arab reports said four other houses also were sealed during an arrest sweep in which 49 suspects were arrested in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>'s largest city. The army refused to confirm those sealings but acknowledged the arrests. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and human rights organizations have condemned house demolitions, saying they deny people due process under the law since suspects rarely are tried before the demolitions. The <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> human rights group <PERSON> Al-Haq </PERSON>, Law in the Service of Man, said the army has destroyed or sealed more than 330 houses in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and 58 in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> since the December 1987 start of the Palestinian uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation of the territories. Also today, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> hospital officials said a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> teen-ager from the <LOCATION> Tulkarem </LOCATION> refugee camp in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> was shot and wounded by soldiers in a clash late Monday night. The army said two houses were sealed in the village of <LOCATION> Samu </LOCATION>, south of the town of <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>, and one house was destroyed in the nearby village of <LOCATION> Beit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ummar </LOCATION>. It said Palestinians living in the houses were part of a strike force that attacked alleged Arabs collaborators. They also threw stones and firebombs at army patrols and set up roadblocks on a highway near the village, the army said. The other house sealed was in the Askar refugee camp near <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>. The army said Palestinians tried to throw building blocks on soldiers from the home's roof two months ago. An army spokesman, who is not identified under military regulations, was unable to say what connection the attackers had to that house. He said soldiers were slightly hurt in the incidents, but gave no details. The military said in a statement that the 49 Palestinians from <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> were arrested on suspicion of throwing fire bombs at a government office, an Israeli bank and an army patrol. The statement said they were members of a group tied to <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> wing of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. The Arab manager of <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leumi </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> was seriously wounded in the attack on the bank, the army said. Also today, a spokesman for the military administration in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> confirmed a report in the <ORGANIZATION> Haaretz </ORGANIZATION> newspaper that the army has been compensating alleged Arab collaborators who are injured or have property damaged in attacks by other Palestinians. The underground leadership of the uprising has repeatedly called for the death of collaborators and 50 have been killed since the start of the revolt.

<HEAD>County Lawsuit Asks $13 Million For Soundproofing Schools</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WHEATON, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> DuPage </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> is suing <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and six airlines for $ 13 million to soundproof schools against jet noise from <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. `` Students' rights have been adversely affected in that verbal presentations in class have been interrupted as a result of excessive jet noises,'' said State's Attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, who filed the lawsuit Monday. The county wants the city and the airlines to pay for soundproofing 22 schools in <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> flight paths. Eleven of the schools already have been soundproofed. Noise levels at the schools do n't exceed the 70-decibel level set by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and city officials, but <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> said that level is too high and that the city and the airlines have failed to correct the problem. The airlines named in the lawsuit are American, <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> and American, the two largest carriers at <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION>, declined to comment, as did attorneys for the city. Students and teachers in <LOCATION> Bensenville </LOCATION> observe a 20-second pause whenever jet noise disrupts classes, Superintendent <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON> said. `` We call it the <LOCATION> Bensenville </LOCATION> pause,'' said <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> recently refused to hear an appeal of a case involving noise and pollution complaints at <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION>, effectively clearing the way for lawsuits seeking damages for noise at the airport.

 Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> signed a broad declaration today that calls for a 50 percent reduction in nuclear arsenals and a worldwide ban on chemical weapons. The document on common principles of both nations was signed on the second day of the Soviet leader's first state visit to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The pact signed by <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said their countries have a common European heritage, and that European nations should exist in `` peaceful competition with one another'' and reduce their military might. It also said cooperation by <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> `` is not directed against anyone'' and that a special place in the `` common European home'' is reserved for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. Asked if the agreement could help resolve territorial questions stirred by the 1939 non-aggression pact signed by <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> and <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> _ which allowed the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to annex three independent Baltic states _ <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>: `` I do n't think we need to turn to such a distant chapter of history.'' He said the joint agreement was to formalize the wish of both <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> to enter `` a new stage in our relations.'' The signing ceremony was carried live on West German television. The two nations appealed for a 50 percent reduction in the strategic nuclear arsenal of the superpowers and a reduction in conventional armies and weapons `` in all of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' The document called for a worldwide ban on chemical weapons, a treaty banning nuclear tests and the preservation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. That accord, signed by both superpowers, is seen by the Soviets and West Germans as a document banning the development of `` Star Wars'' space defenses advocated by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s predecessor, <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. The document signed today also stressed the importance of respect for human rights, cultural contacts and youth exchanges for promoting lasting peace. The Soviets and West Germans also signed 11 other agreements, including pacts to establish a `` hot line'' between <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>, and to increase educational and youth exchanges. Earlier, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> received a rapturous reception that outstripped the welcome given two weeks ago to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who scores far below the Soviet leader in West German opinion polls. When <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> arrived in this key <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> country on Monday, he declared that <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> had begun `` a new chapter'' in relations that could bring a new era of peace to the continent. He also welcomed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposals to reduce conventional forces on the continent, saying they offer chances for speedy agreement. Outside <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>'s 18th-century Town Hall today, a crowd chanted `` <LOCATION> Gorby </LOCATION>! <LOCATION> Gorby </LOCATION>!'' and waved dozens of Soviet flags. `` A Soviet leader surrounded by cheering West Germans, who would have thought of that a few years ago?'' exclaimed a television commentator during a live national broadcast. Other banners reflected the German pain at the postwar division of their nation and of the former capital, <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, telling <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> `` German unity _ peace in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'' and, in English, `` <LOCATION> Gorby </LOCATION>, make love not walls.'' No German needs to be reminded of the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall. Most of the crowd cheered <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> but many hooted disapproval when Mayor <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON>, in a brief speech before a ceremonial exchange of gifts, referred to <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> as only the temporary capital of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, `` substituting for <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> proposed Monday that <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> combat pollution and exchange technology and emergency assistance in case of an environmental disaster. And in a gesture of reconciliation, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> released the names of 1,500 German soldiers who died in its prisoner-of-war camps during World War II. It was the first time the Soviets had provided a list of German soldiers still unaccounted for after the war, West German officials said. At a formal dinner Monday night, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said the Soviets were pleased that the West has responded to some <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact suggestions in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s arms control proposal last month, which links short-range nuclear missile reductions to swift and substantial cuts in conventional forces. `` There is now reason to presume that an agreement in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> -LRB- conventional arms talks -RRB- can be reached much more quickly than was expected earlier,'' he said. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> stressed, however, that the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> still wants separate talks on reducing short-range nuclear weapons in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has pushed for progress on conventional arms before short-range missiles are addressed. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> appealed to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> for the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> to make a unilateral cut in short-range nuclear missiles. The Soviets concede that the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact has an advantage in short-range forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact would wait until a meeting of its leaders, expected next month, to give a detailed response to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposals for substantial cuts in East-bloc and Western armies in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> by the early 1990s

 The federal <ORGANIZATION> Equal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opportunity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> has sued on behalf of a state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> justice who is challenging the <ORGANIZATION> Vermont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constitution </ORGANIZATION>'s requirement that judges retire at age 70. Justice <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Peck </PERSON> turned 70 in December but refused to retire. He maintains that the requirement violates the federal ban on age discrimination. After several lawyers questioned <PERSON> Peck </PERSON>'s right to hear cases, the administrator of <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>'s courts put him on retirement status effective June 30. <PERSON> Peck </PERSON> filed a complaint with the <ORGANIZATION> EEOC </ORGANIZATION>, which sued in federal court late last week.

They are semi-retired, determine their own workload and handle about 15 percent of federal cases. Federal judges can take senior status as early as age 65. About a dozen states have mandatory retirement for judges. A federal appeals court in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> has upheld that state's provision, saying <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> did not mean for the Age Discrimination in Employment Act to apply to appointed state judges But courts in other states have disagreed.

<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee chairman released internal <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> documents that he said raised new doubts about the department's plan to open the nation's first permanent nuclear waste dump in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> desert. Rep. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Synar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., questioned how the department could meet its September target date for opening the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant, a $ 700 million underground facility designed to entomb wastes from the manufacture of nuclear weapons contaminated with plutonium, which remains radioactive for 24,000 years At a meeting Monday of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on environment, energy and natural resources, <PERSON> Synar </PERSON> said the department was `` inviting failure'' by trying to overcome all the technical hurdles to opening the facility by September. He suggested that it would be safer to put off the opening for some months. The repository, situated near <LOCATION> Carlsbad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, originally was to open last October. It was put off because of delays in verifying that the design and construction are sound. <PERSON> Synar </PERSON> made public internal memorandums from <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> safety officers that he said indicated the department still was unable to provide assurances on the design and construction. A memo dated June 1, from <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Knight </PERSON>, director of the department's office of safety appraisals, said `` significant additional effort in ongoing staffing, training, procedure development and documentation is necessary'' before the department could approve opening the facility. A similar note of caution was sounded by <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fultz </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> official who told the subcommittee hearing that his agency's review of the waste dump plan indicated the department `` has not yet satisfactorily addressed all key issues.'' Energy Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>, in a statement issued June 3, said he still expected to open the waste dump in September for its 5-year experimental and test period. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> cautioned against `` inaccurate public alarm'' about progress at the waste site.

 A defecting Afghan army officer who claims he had access to top-level security records said today that a Soviet general is President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s top adviser. `` His name is Gen. <PERSON> Verinikov </PERSON>. He is a three-star general. He comes every day without failure to the headquarters meeting in Arg Palace and whatever he says is never rejected,'' <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Kakar </PERSON> <PERSON> Neda </PERSON> told a news conference. In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, an officer at the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said the general had served as <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s military adviser but left <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> in February when the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> announced that the last of its troops had returned home from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. `` Since the withdrawal of our forces, he's been here in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and he has n't been advising anyone,'' the officer said, speaking on condition of anonymity. He identified the general as <PERSON> Valentin </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Varenikov </PERSON>, a different spelling than the one given by <ORGANIZATION> Neda </ORGANIZATION>, and said he had `` one big star,'' denoting a higher rank than the three stars described by <ORGANIZATION> Neda </ORGANIZATION>. The officer said <PERSON> Varenikov </PERSON> was now the main commander of Soviet land forces. <ORGANIZATION> Neda </ORGANIZATION>, who can be located only through intermediaries because he said he is concerned about his safety, could not be contacted immediately for further comment. Western and Afghan observers in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> have said scores of Soviet advisers, both military and civilian, remain in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. A well-placed source said that a Soviet colonel was seen at <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> airport in March. When recognized, the colonel said he had retired from the military and returned to <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> as a civilian adviser, the source said on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Neda </PERSON> said he himself was promoted to brigadier general shortly before coming to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> on March 23. He said he served as secretary to the <ORGANIZATION> Afghan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> for the Defense of the Homeland, a 20-man group headed by <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>. The council assumed top government authority when <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> declared a state of emergency on Feb. 18, three days after the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> announced it had ended its nine years of direct combat support for the Afghan army in the war against U.S.-backed Moslem guerrillas. `` <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s support in the party is not very good, and if he did not have Soviets attached to him, he would not be able to survive,'' <PERSON> Neda </PERSON> said. `` Right now he has a very strong Soviet support group, and with this group is Gen. Verinikov.'' <ORGANIZATION> Neda </ORGANIZATION> said he had never heard the Soviet general's first name but had seen him and knew that he met top Afghan military officials. <PERSON> Neda </PERSON> said he also had seen Afghan military documents that said 40,000 soldiers defected from the 250,000-man army between Sept. 1 and March 1. Other papers reaching the council said <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s government had `` nominal control'' of just 4,000 of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s officially recorded 36,000 villages and 10,000 other villages were `` destroyed and uninhabitable'' after a decade of civil war, <PERSON> Neda </PERSON> said. The rest of the villages, he added, were controlled by or sympathetic to the mujahedeen -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warriors </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- who have been fighting to topple <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>'s Soviet-style government for the past decade. <PERSON> Neda </PERSON> said he was a full member of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. His name, however, was not on the list of members announced by the government in February. `` That is correct,'' he said in response to a reporter's question `` In the beginning of March, I was promoted to this post.'' His assertion could not be independently confirmed, but the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government has a history of making appointments without public announcement. <ORGANIZATION> Neda </ORGANIZATION> said he had been one of four secretaries attached to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and was elevated to full council membership as a result of long-time association with Vice President <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatif </PERSON>, a senior council member. The 47-year-old <PERSON> Neda </PERSON> said he was not a combat soldier and had spent most of his military career in engineering and construction work before rising in the military bureaucracy. <ORGANIZATION> Neda </ORGANIZATION>'s remarks were translated by Said <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Maiwand </PERSON>, a self-exiled Afghan who opposes the <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> government and is at odds with most mujahedeen factions as well. <ORGANIZATION> Neda </ORGANIZATION>, however, understood some English and said he spent part of 1978 in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on a military training course, studying English at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> and engineering at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Belvoir </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION>.

 <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> told a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> conference today that it needs money from other nations to stem the exodus of people fleeing the country, and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> said it would accept more of the boat people. The conference, attended by 60 countries, is expected to endorse a proposal to reduce the number of Vietnamese leaving their country for economic reasons and to promote regular emigration programs. The plan will include screening procedures for all new arrivals in <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> coastal states to determine whether they are fleeing political persecution. If they are, they will be eligible for refugee status and resettlement. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> deputy secretary of <ORGANIZATION> state </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON>, announced that over the next three years the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will accept 22,000 of the 55,000 Vietnamese now in refugee camps. In addition, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> anticipates accepting up to half of all new arrivals granted refugee status, he said. Vietnamese officials called on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to accept more refugees, but it was not immediately clear if Vietnamese officials were satisfied with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commitment. The number of boat people declined in the early 1980s, but the exodus has accelerated again. Almost 90,000 Vietnamese, three times the 1986 total, now are living in refugee camps assisted by the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> High Commissioner for Refugees. Another 100,000 refugees from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> live in the camps. The Japanese <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said today that 43 Vietnamese refugees, rescued by a <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> tanker in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> on June 4, arrived today at <LOCATION> Tomakomai </LOCATION>, a port on <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s northernmost main island of Hokkaido <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said `` fair international mechanisms must be found'' to deal with boat people `` while preserving the universal respect _ and preventing the abuse of _ the principle of asylum.'' <PERSON> Jean-Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Hocke </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> high commissioner for refugees, said the growing number of asylum seekers has caused an `` acute crisis'' in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and poses a burden for other coastal state destinations of boat people. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Co </PERSON> <PERSON> Thach </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> said one way to stop the exodus would be to grant international assistance to regions of his country that face serious economic difficulties `` and where illegal departures take place.'' He said <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> opposes the return of boat people who have been denied refugee status, as urged by some countries. <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> also said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will remain oppposed to forcing Vietnamese refugees to return home `` unless and until dramatic improvements occur in that country's economic, social and political life.'' <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> will take up to 11,000 Vietnamese now in camps and a `` generous proportion'' of new arrivals, provided other countries also participate in the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> plan, said Foreign Minister <PERSON> Gareth </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 The Communist Party chief in <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION> apologized today to <PERSON> Meshki </PERSON> <PERSON> Turks </PERSON> for violence directed at them during 10 days of rioting, arson and killings in the republic, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported today. The state-run news agency said party chief <PERSON> Rafik </PERSON> <PERSON> Nishanov </PERSON> made the apology on behalf of the people of the Central Asian republic during a visit to a temporary camp for <PERSON> Meshki </PERSON> <PERSON> Turk </PERSON> refugees. Much of the violence that has swept the <LOCATION> Fergana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> in the republic, about 1,500 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, was perpetrated by the majority Uzbeks on the ethnic Turkish minority, according to official news reports. <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Mikhailov </PERSON> said 90 people, including a police officer, had been killed and that 974 people had been injured. Earlier press reports put the death toll at 100. <PERSON> Mikhailov </PERSON> also said 748 houses were burned down and that 28 buildings of `` economic significance'' were torched. Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> today played down the role of ethnic strife in the violence. `` There's something altogether different going on there,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, where is on a four-day state visit. ` It's not so much inter-ethnic conflict as a kind of crude fundamentalism. But we must look at the problem more closely.'' It was not clear if he was referring to Moslem fundamentalism. The Uzbeks and the Meshki Turks are Moslems. Premier <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON>, former <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chebrikov </PERSON> and Interior Minister <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakatin </PERSON> accompanied Nishanov to the refugee camp, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. The Kremlin had dispatched them to investigate the disturbances on the spot. `` All measures for liquidating the circumstances of the Fergana events will be taken and those guilty of crimes will be found and punished in accordance with all Soviet laws,'' <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> said. Thousands of <PERSON> Meshki </PERSON> <PERSON> Turks </PERSON>, forcibly resettled in <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION> from their homeland in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> by the late dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> in 1944, have been evacuated because of the violence to central <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> and the neighboring republics of <LOCATION> Kazakhstan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tadjikistan </LOCATION>, Soviet media reported. Tension remained in <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION> and security troops were prepared to quell further violence, Soviet officials and state-run media said. Panicky rumors can `` be the detonator of the next explosion with unpredictable consequences,'' the government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Mobile units are ready, helicopters are in the airport ready at any time,'' said Pravda, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily. More than 11,000 troops, mainly from the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, continued to patrol the area, a ministry spokesman said. <PERSON> Mikhailov </PERSON> said criminal charges were being brought in 30 cases and that 557 people had been detained for participating in violenct acts. More than 1,000 people were detained for violating curfew but were later released. <PERSON> Mikhailov </PERSON> said authorities had confiscated 5,561 weapons, most of them hunting weapons and knives. The popoulation has been asked to turn in weapons voluntarily to keep them out of the hands of `` extremists,'' he said. Telephone calls to the area could not be put through Tuesday because lines were down, an operator said.

<HEAD>Uno Cabinet Receives Lowest Initial Public Support Rating</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Prime Minister <PERSON> Sousuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> refused again today to answer questions by opposition lawmakers about a geisha who reportedly claimed she was paid to be his mistress. A poll, meanwhile, showed his Cabinet had one of the worst ratings of any new Japanese government. In an upper house <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> session, lawmakers questioned <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> for a third day about a weekly magazine's report quoting an unidentified 40-year-old woman as saying <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> paid her about $ 2,100 a month for four months in 1985 to be his mistress. <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON> Keiko </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiba </PERSON> asked for an explanation and said <PERSON> Uno </PERSON>'s `` vague attitude'' would jeopardize international trust in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> when he attends the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> meeting of major industrial democracies next month. <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> replied only that he would try to be worthy of being `` the sole representative from among Asian countries, and one of the advanced countries,'' at the forum. The report about the geisha was not covered by the poll on Uno and his Cabinet, conducted Friday and Saturday by the national newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Asahi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Asahi </ORGANIZATION> said only 28 percent of those questioned in its nationwide poll supported the Cabinet, tying the previous low for a new Cabinet, that of <PERSON> Takeo </PERSON> <PERSON> Fukuda </PERSON> in 1977. The <ORGANIZATION> Asahi </ORGANIZATION> said the poor rating reflected public dissatisfaction with <PERSON> Uno </PERSON>'s initial efforts at political reform in response to the Recruit influence-peddling scandal. The scandal involved dozens of prominent political figures and forced <PERSON> Uno </PERSON>'s predecessor, <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, to resign. Shortly before he left the prime minister post, <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s approval rating had fallen below 4 percent in some polls <PERSON> Uno </PERSON>, 66, who was foreign minister under <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, took office as prime minister on June 3 after the governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chose him as its new leader because of his clean image. The geisha reports came later. The <ORGANIZATION> Asahi </ORGANIZATION> also said 44 percent of the 2,379 adults questioned in the poll indicated they opposed Uno's Cabinet _ the highest non-support rate for any new Cabinet in the 34 years the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> have been <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s dominant party. The <PERSON> Asahi </PERSON> did not give a margin of error for the poll. It said 73 percent of the respondents wanted Uno to dissolve the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> and call new general elections `` as early as possible.'' Another 13 percent opposed such a move, the newspaper said. Opposition party leaders have called for early elections as a way for the voters to judge the ruling party's handling of the influence-peddling scandal. Prosecutors say that about 160 influential politicians, businessmen and bureaucrats were offered bargain-priced unlisted shares in a real estate subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, an information-publishing giant. Purchasers reaped handsome profits by selling the shares after they went public in October 1986.

<TEXT>
 Commercialization of biomedical research in American universities is threatening the integrity of scientific institutions, a congressional panel was told today. <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON> <PERSON> Krimsky </PERSON>, associate professor of urban and environmental policy at <ORGANIZATION> Tufts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, testified before the human resources sucommittee of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Government Operations. `` There have been changes in the social norms and values of biomedical scientists and their academic institutions,'' <PERSON> Krimsky </PERSON> said. `` I believe some of these changes are detrimental to the general well-being of basic science and to the public interest.'' `` Biomedical science has been intensely commercialized within universities over a relatively short period of time,'' he said. `` I have heard it said within the scientific community that everyone gains from this marriage of academia and commerce. Nothing can be further from the truth. `` Not only are there losses, but some of these losses threaten the integrity of our scientific institutions and weaken public confidence in science.'' He called for disclosure of financial interests related to research being conducted by scientists applying for grants. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Noble </PERSON>, a professor of history at <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and a founding member of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Universities </ORGANIZATION> in the Public Interest, said universy researchers `` are free to make undisclosed arrangements with private corporations in which they often have equally undisclosed personal roles.'' `` They are free to shape and profit from the public investment in research and many have done so,'' he said. <PERSON> Noble </PERSON> said collaboration between universities and industries may be useful but should be accompanied by `` proper disclosure and procedural safeguards.'' Rep. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, chairman of the subcommittee, said, `` I am sure that many Americans will be justifiably outraged by some of the ways that federally funded scientific data are being sold, or manipulated for personal gain.'' Rep. <PERSON> Larkin </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, the ranking Republican member of the panel, said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should `` send a strong signal to the research community that scientific misconduct will not be tolerated.'' At the same time, he said, `` A careful balance must be struck between avoiding conflicts of interest and achieving scientific breakthroughs that ultimately could benefit millions. We should not allow limited or individual cases of misconduct to stand in the way of overall progress.''

 A rash of accidental shootings of children by children is being blamed on <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s liberal gun law and is renewing a push for legislation against leaving guns within reach of a youngster. Five shootings since June 1 involving children playing with guns at home have left two youngsters dead and one near death today. Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> on Monday said he will consider adding gun legislation to the agenda of a special summer session he wants to call on transportation matters. `` There's been a series of tragic accidents here that has the people of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> very concerned,'' said <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>. Under a bill proposed earlier this month by Rep. <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>, leaving a firearm in reach of a child would be a misdemeanor. It would be a felony carrying up to five years in prison if a child died or was maimed. The bill, which borrows language from the state's abandoned-refrigerator law, would require that guns be secured with a trigger lock or kept in a locked container A spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said the group would not oppose the bill if were amended to exclude shootings involving guns stolen from a home, but she said the law would be superfluous. `` We have laws on our books now that deal with child endangerment, negligence, culpable negligence and criminal negligence and there is recourse in the civil courts,'' said <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammer </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> said much of the problem results from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s 1987 gun law, which all but eliminated cooling-off periods for purchases, banned local gun-control ordinances and allowed most Floridians to carry a concealed weapon. <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>' measure passed in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> during the recently completed regular session, but the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> did n't take it up. On Monday, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> said he would like to see the bill included in a special session. `` Anything that would encourage the family to be more aware of the dangers of leaving loaded guns in that setting ... I'd be willing to work with you on that,'' he said. Some lawmakers expressed reservations. `` You ca n't legislate against all tragedy,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Lois </PERSON> <PERSON> Frankel </PERSON>. `` Why would the threat of going to jail be any more a deterrent to carelessness than having your child killed?'' The latest shooting victim, 4-year-old <PERSON> Silvio </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON>, was listed in very critical condition today at <ORGANIZATION> Tampa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. He had found his father's .25 - caliber pistol under a living room chair Sunday, police No statewide statistics on such accidents are kept, said <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Booz </PERSON>, information specialist for the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and nine opposition groups opened landmark talks today on the terms of holding the first multi-party elections since the communists came to power in 1948. The meeting comes four weeks after <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> had its freest and most competitive elections under communist rule. The Hungarian talks are to set the stage for free elections that will be held by mid-1990 at the latest. <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Karoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> told the evening daily <ORGANIZATION> Esti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hirlap </ORGANIZATION> today that the talks mark `` an important step'' in the party's development since a party conference in May 1988, when <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> replaced longtime party leader <PERSON> Janos </PERSON> <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> and avid reformers were brought into the party leadership. He led the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s delegation, which also included Politburo reformer <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gyoergy </PERSON> <PERSON> Fejti </PERSON>, who has been in charge of preliminary exchanges with the opposition. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Toelgyessy </PERSON>, a spokesman, was quoted by the paper as saying the opposition's aim at the talks was to lead the country to the first free elections. `` We do n't want to make final decisions above the people's heads,'' he was quoted as saying `` We want to use the negotiations to decide the rules to be followed in the democratic transition.'' The talks were opened by parliament speaker <PERSON> Matyas </PERSON> <PERSON> Szueros </PERSON>, who presided over the opening round in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>'s ornate parliament building and briefly addressed the negotiators. In an earlier statement, <PERSON> Szueroes </PERSON> said the talks would probably be `` decisive for the direction and speed'' of transformation to a multi-party system, the state news agency <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> reported. The government and opposition on Saturday agreed to hold the talks. Also participating are the official trade unions and the left-wing <ORGANIZATION> Ferenc </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Muennich </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, which opposes a change in the one-party system. The nine opposition groups initially wanted the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> organizations left out of the meetings but later agreed to their participation. <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>'s party chief, <PERSON> Mihaly </PERSON> <PERSON> Jasso </PERSON>, in an interview published today warned of a possible split within the party brought on by reforms. He said in the case of a split, the party would likely `` fall to pieces.'' <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> told a weekend meeting of communists in the city of <LOCATION> Gyoer </LOCATION> that a `` real danger'' of a split exists. <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> said there were differences among party factions over the pace of reforms and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s foreign policy orientation.

<UNK>Anti-Apartheid Leaders Further Restricted Under Emergency</UNK>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government today further restricted the movements of anti-apartheid leaders and prevented them from participating in peace talks to end factional fighting in <LOCATION> Zululand </LOCATION>. More than 500 people have received restriction orders that interfere with their freedom of movement and prohibit them from addressing public meetings or being quoted in the press, the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> and Order said. And many were further restricted after President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> renewed the 4-year-old state of emergency on Friday. Those included members of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, which had scheduled peace talks this week in <ORGANIZATION> Natal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Province </ORGANIZATION> to end factional fighting among anti-apartheid groups that has left 1,500 dead since 1986. `` We can not interpret this as anything other than a deliberate attempt to perpetuate the divisions which have caused such frightful bloodshed in <LOCATION> Natal </LOCATION>,'' said Anglican Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>. <PERSON> Govan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mbeki </PERSON>, 79, an official with the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the main South African guerrilla organization, today was restricted to his apartment from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. He had already been banned from speaking to the press, addressing public gatherings and leaving the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brighton </LOCATION> township without permission. The restrictions will stop him from participating in the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> peace talks with the Zulu group, <LOCATION> Inkatha </LOCATION>. On Monday, <PERSON> Archie </PERSON> <PERSON> Gumede </PERSON>, 75, a co-president of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Natal </LOCATION> was placed under house arrest from 8 pm. to 5 a.m. daily. He was already prohibited from talking to the press, addressing public gatherings, or helping to prepare material for publication. The Front's other co-president, <PERSON> Albertina </PERSON> <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON>, is under similar restrictions, as are most executive members of the anti-apartheid coalition. The group's leaders have frequently accused police of trying to sabotage the peace talks and of encouraging violence in the <ORGANIZATION> Natal </ORGANIZATION> townships rather than trying to subdue it. `` For more than 18 months <ORGANIZATION> Natal </ORGANIZATION> and national church leaders have been trying to bring to an end the conflict between political rivals in the province,'' <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> said. `` During this period the government has acted only to hamper the process, never to help it.

<TEXT>
 Thousands of ethnic Turks deported from <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> have poured across the border in the past three weeks, leaving behind what they say is a nightmare of government persecution, officials said today. Since May 26, when <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> started the deportations, the number of arrivals has reached 16,297, the foreign ministry said today. Tent cities are being erected in a hurry. `` As if they -LRB- the Bulgarians -RRB- are trying to test the strength and power of the Turkish state, they are sending wave after wave of people to the border,'' <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> minister <PERSON> Ercument </PERSON> <PERSON> Konukman </PERSON> told reporters. Publicly, Premier <PERSON> Turgut </PERSON> <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> has said <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> will accept all deported ethnic Turks. But officials say <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>'s resources will be severely strained if the forced exodus from <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> continues. The present wave of immigration comes at a time when <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> is hard pressed with other refugee problems. In August, 50,000 Kurds fleeing Iraqi attacks crossed the border into <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. About 35,000 of them remain, housed in tent cities and crowded apartment buildings in southeastern <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. According to official estimates, <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> is also home to 600,000 Iranians who fled the Islamic revolution or the war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and settled in <LOCATION> Turkish </LOCATION> cities, principally <LOCATION> Istanbul </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> began deporting ethnic Turks after unrest in the northeastern and southern regions last month. Many deported led resistance to a forced assimilation campaign that began in 1983 and includes changing ethnic Turks Moslem names to Slavic ones. Also under the campaign, <LOCATION> Sofia </LOCATION> barred the public use of the Turkish language and practice of Islamic religious rites. Deportees said police attacked ethnic Turks at late May demonstrations against the campaign with dogs and clubs, killing about 40 people. <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> has proposed negotiations with <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> to hammer out an immigration agreement that would allow ethnic Turks to dispose of their property and bring out liquid assets. Deportees have said they were not allowed to take with them more than a suitcase. <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> claims the Moslem minority numbers 780,000 while Turkish officials put it at 2.5 million in the total population of 9 million. Through defections and immigration agreements, 380,00 ethnic Turks have come to <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> since 1925.

<DATELINE>GRAND TETON NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, standing against the backdrop of the majestic Grand Tetons, declared today that `` environmental gridlock must end'' and appealed to the public and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to unite behind his plan to clean <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s polluted air. Invoking the memories of past presidents who created the national parks, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said his clean air initiative marks `` a new chapter in the tradiion of protecting our people and their parks.'' He made the remarks in a speech at the <ORGANIZATION> Teton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, an outdoor education center located inside this 310,000-acre mountainous preserve. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spoke on a brilliant morning in a field where bison roam in the winter, with the 13,770-foot <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Teton </LOCATION> mountain behind him in the distance, the tallest peak in the 40-mile, snow-capped range. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who visited the still-blackened expanse of <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> before arriving here Monday for an evening of fishing with his grandson, said `` nature needs our help.'' `` Today, with my back to the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> and the jewels of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rockies </ORGANIZATION>, I look east across this fertile and productive land and call on the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people _ and on <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> _ to join me in this new initiative for clean air,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, an avid outdoorsman who has treked through the Tetons in the past. Recalling his meetings with environmental and industry groups before putting the finishing touches on the package he unveiled Monday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` No group is going to get everything it wants. Some say we're asking too much, too fast. Others say not enough, too slow.'' But now, he said, `` there's one thing everyone agrees on: we need action. And we need it now. `` Every American deserves to breath clean air. And you should n't have to drive two thousand miles here to do it Environmental gridlock must end,'' he declared. National Park Service police removed several demonstrators from the site before <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> arrived. They had signs denouncing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s handling of the Valdez oil spill <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Northup </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said they were arrested for demonstrating in a national park without a permit. They were taken to <LOCATION> Teton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also announced he is nominating <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> State Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> as director of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, a past <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> president, and his family own Triangle X dude ranch in Grand Teton park. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` Creating national parks was an American idea ... and it was one of our best.'' From <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>, who granted <LOCATION> Yosemite </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, to <PERSON> Teddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>, who made the environment a hallmark of his presidency, past presidents have done their part to help Americans enjoy their natural heritage, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. His new plan is aimed at improving and preserving `` the very air we breathe ... for another five generations and beyond,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. Even the Tetons, `` the heart of an environmental success story ... can not escape the threat of pollution,'' he said. `` It can follow you here. But the good news is, we're not going to put up with it any longer,'' he said. Later, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was flying to <LOCATION> Lincoln </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, to underscore his support for alternative fuels research. Earlier, in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Room </LOCATION> of the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had unveiled a clean air package that he promised would cut acid rain-causing sulfur dioxide emissions in half by the year 2000. The initiative drew applause from industrialists, environmentalists and lawmakers alike _ with some reservations. Environmental leaders hailed his stance on acid rain, but questioned whether the plan was tough enough on smog and toxic industrial pollutants. Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, and coal lobbyists said it would put high-sulfur coal areas at a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> promised that his legislative package `` will be cost-effective, but above all, it will work. We will make the 1990s the era for clean air.'' With a nod to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> _ but not a word about his predecessor <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s failure to press the topic _ <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` We've seen enough of this stalemate. It's time to clear the air. And you know, I think we will.'' The president is banking on the sale of 1 million methanol-powered cars a year by 1997 to help rid <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s big cities of smog. White House chief of staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> told reporters on <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> One that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> hopes to sign a clean air bill `` by the fall.'' <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> estimated the overall program would cost between $ 14 billion and $ 19 billion a year after it is in full effect at the turn of the century. <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> said the stiffer standards would add 5 to 10 percent to utility rates in 18 states that burn high sulfur coal and contribute the most to the acid rain problem. But he said their rates would still fall below the national average.

The bills would: _ Extend through 1992 the targeted-jobs tax credit, under which the government, in effect, pays up to $ 2,400 of the first-year wages paid economically disadvantaged workers, especially Vietnam-era veterans and those aged 18 through 22 This would cost the government $ 647 million over the next five years. _ Renew through 1992, with some modifications, the credit for investment in housing for low-income Americans This would cost more than $ 3 billion over five years. _ Extend through 1992, at a cost of $ 145 million, a credit for rehabilitation of historic and other older buildings The credit is for 10 percent of costs associated with non-residential buildings built before 1936 and 20 percent for rehabilitation of certified historic structures. _ Drop one complex step, involving `` adjusted current earnings,'' from the calculations by which corporations determine their liability for the minimum tax Aides said the version approved by the subcommittee avoids all but $ 100 million of the five-year $ 4.2 billion revenue loss that had been estimated for the original bill, sponsored by Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ill </LOCATION>.

 Final preparations began this morning for the first atomic chain reaction at the long-delayed <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> nuclear plant. `` We would be in position for first fission to occur late this afternoon or early this evening,'' plant spokesman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Sher </PERSON> said. The $ 6 billion reactor won a low-power testing license last month after years of delay and protests that made the plant a symbol of anti-nuclear activism and forced its chief owner into bankruptcy court. Plant officials hope to win a commercial license by the end of the year. Plant officials had hoped to start atomic operations as early as a week ago but were stymied by a malfunctioning valve in the emergency cooling system. The system's valves worked properly in tests early Monday, <PERSON> Sher </PERSON> said.

 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> will do all it can to stop the poaching of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s endangered black rhinoceroses, Environment Minister Lord <ORGANIZATION> Caithness </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. But he also called on individuals to help end the illegal trade in rhinoceros horns. `` We will certainly do at the government level what we can because this is a very serious question,'' <ORGANIZATION> Caithness </ORGANIZATION> said at the launch of an appeal fund for the charity Rhino Rescue. `` A government can only do a certain amount.

The exhibit, which opened May 18 and ended Sunday, is the first American film show in communist <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. It will appear in <LOCATION> Bratislava </LOCATION> in September as part of a U.S.-Czechoslovak cultural agreement. Six films were shown at eight screenings a day at three different sites in <LOCATION> PKOJF </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>'s largest amusement park. The most popular movie, according to organizers, was `` <PERSON> Sophie </PERSON>'s Choice.'' `` I wish we had more shows like this and more often,'' one man wrote in a visitor's book. The exhibit has toured many East European capitals since it was launched in 1984, and total viewership is estimated at 700,000, show officials said. Also on display were posters, original costumes, photos and other items. A photo of Czech-born filmmaker <PERSON> Milos </PERSON> <PERSON> Forman </PERSON> invited visitors to the corner of `` Famous Czechs Who Made It In <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>,'' featuring an Oscar awarded to <PERSON> Theodor </PERSON> <PERSON> Pistek </PERSON> for his costumes in `` Amadeus,'' which was shot in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> in 1983. <PERSON> Forman </PERSON> moved to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1968 when <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact tanks ended the `` Prague Spring'' reforms and won five Oscars with `` One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.'' `` The average age of those who came here most was between 15 and 25,'' said <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Stokelin </PERSON>, the exhibit's manager. `` It is, therefore, no surprise that the advertising trailers of <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>'s ` Coming to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>' and <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Waits </PERSON>' ` Cold Feet' created temporary bottlenecks down there,'' said <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaenner </PERSON>, the show's coordinator `` I think I should be inside in less than two hours,'' an enthusiastic teen-ager said at the end of a long line Sunday.

<TEXT>
 A bingo operation that grossed $ 562,000 in the name of a tiny church did so without authorization and turned over none of the proceeds, the pastor says. The use of the name of <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cyprian </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> is `` without authorization or even fraudulent,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bench </PERSON>. Bingo is illegal in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> unless sponsored by a tax-exempt organization, with the profits going to charity. An operation headed by <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Charities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consultants </ORGANIZATION>, has used a permit in the name of the church. Charities Consultants runs bingo games in the names of 51 charities. <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> would not comment about the permit. The bingo operation in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cyprian </LOCATION>'s name has taken in $ 562,000 since last July from games at <LOCATION> Myrtle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, state records show. It has paid out $ 420,000 in prizes, leaving $ 142,000 for expenses and profit. Bench, overseer of St. Cyprian since July, said he does not know <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> and has not been able to find any records of bingo income over the past five years. He said Monday he has requested a state <ORGANIZATION> Tax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> investigation. Bench's predecessor, the Rev. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Evatt </PERSON>, said a <LOCATION> Webster </LOCATION> associate agreed to pay the church $ 200 to $ 400 a month for use of the name. He said there was no written contract, and he did not know how much the games took in. `` Apparently the operation was bigger than I thought,'' he said. <PERSON> Evatt </PERSON> said that when he left <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cyprian </PERSON>'s last year he did not inform Bench about the bingo games but assumed the game operators would. `` When I took over St. <PERSON> Cyprian </PERSON>'s, it was absolutely bankrupt and that's why I checked the records,'' <PERSON> Bench </PERSON> said. <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cyprian </PERSON> has 100 members and a monthly offering of about $ 600, church officials said. Earlier this year, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> Bishop <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Unterkoefler </PERSON> banned bingo as inappropriate for raising money for diocesan churches and schools, but he said games operating on church premises can continue until July 1990.

 For the young photographer, the decision to go underground was n't hard: last week, police with rifles burst through the door to his house. He had been warned beforehand by a neighbor, and now is living on the run, his appearance changed by a haircut, shave, some weight loss and rugged worker's clothes replacing his light polyester shirts. `` I am a new man,'' he said, laughing heartily in a small restaurant at his first sit-down meal in a week. `` A new Communist man.'' The photographer, a <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> member from <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, is one of hundreds of people wanted by police for participation in a movement for freedom. Some of the wanted are well-known, their faces appearing on television. On Tuesday night, a nationally televised news program showed photographs with biographical information of 21 student leaders being sought by the government. The photographer was not among them. His alleged crimes are vague: during the seven weeks of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s pro-democracy demonstrations leading up to the June 3-4 killings by the army, he took thousands of photos of marchers, hoping to chronicle the movement one day He spent much time with the students and even wore a white headband that read `` Hunger Strike for Freedom.'' When the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> stormed <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, the photographer was there, snapping pictures as bullets cut down friends and classmates Soldiers detained him briefly on June 4. `` My mind was so clear at that moment. I convinced them to let me go. When I walked away from the barracks, people came up to me. ` We've heard gunshots from there all day,' they said. ` We thought you'd been executed also,''' he recounted. Now, he says he moves from dormitory rooms to friends' apartments. `` Last night my old girlfriend took me in. Before that, it was my high school teacher. Tonight I do n't know where I'll be. I'd like to get out of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>,'' he said. Leaving <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> is difficult. Troops and police fill the railroad station, searching baggage and interrogating passengers about their destinations. State-run news reports say more than 70 pro-democracy activists have been arrested fleeing the capital. `` I went down there to get a ticket, but I saw troops take two students away,'' he said. `` The soldiers surrounded these guys and smacked one in the head with a rifle butt. I was too scared to wait around.'' A martial law regulation requires citizens to turn in anyone suspected of participating in the pro-democracy campaign. Telephone lines have opened throughout the city for use by informants. `` The thing that scares me is that people seem to be listening to the government's order telling us to report on each other,'' he said. `` We Chinese like to tell on people. Maybe some one is jealous and wants my cameras. Maybe they want to get ahead and need to report someone. It does n't have to be for political reasons.'' Despite the government's stepped-up efforts to track down activists in the democratic movement, the photographer was confident he could make it out of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> safely. `` A few days ago I was down. Life was dark,'' he said. `` But today I woke up and everything had lifted from me. I just want to go far away, find a place in the mountains and hide a while.'' The meal ended and he got on his bicycle. He turned west at one corner, looked back over his shoulder and smiled.

<HEAD>Design Said to Depict Soldiers Heading Down Tree-Lined Path into
Battle</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The design for a long-sought, $ 6 million Korean War veterans' memorial being unveiled Wednesday depicts soldiers heading down a tree-lined path into battle, according to sources familiar with the plan. Architects of the project, to be built across the Reflecting Pool from the Vietnam Veterans' Memorial, also contemplate a wall containing inscriptions about the war. No one involved in the memorial _ from the designers to the Veterans of Foreign Wars and other sponsors _ anticipates the controversy that surrounded the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> memorial at its Veterans Day dedication in 1982. A vocal group backed by then-Interior Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Watt </PERSON> opposed the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> project as unheroic. The group won a concession when a statue of three battle-weary soldiers was added in 1984 to the memorial's V-shaped wall bearing the names of those killed in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. A one-eighth scale model of the Korean memorial is being unveiled at a White House ceremony on Wednesday. The four designers said they could not describe the project until then. But several government and non-government sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, described a succession of granite or bronze soldiers intended to collectively depict a transition from the anxious but brave entrance into war, to combat, to returning home. Four <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> architects were named by a jury of Korean War veterans two weeks ago as the winners of a national contest to design the memorial. They described their entry a combination of sculpture, architecture and landscape design. All of the 1,019 competitors for the $ 20,000 first prize were guided by a memorial `` concept'' conveyed to them by the Korean War <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which was responsible for picking the winner and raising funds. Some of the $ 6 million has yet to be raised, and it is uncertain when the memorial will be completed. The purposes of the memorial, according to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Battle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monuments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, include expressing the `` the enduring gratitude of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people for all who took part in that war under our flag.'' The memorial is also to `` project in most positive fashion the spirit of service, the willingness to sacrifice, and the dedication to the cause of freedom that characterized all participants.'' Some 5.7 million Americans served in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> during the 1950-53 conflict. More than 54,000 were killed, roughly the same number killed in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. The war began after the Soviet-trained North Korean army crossed the 38th parallel into <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, and ended with a truce on July 27, 1953. `` I did n't know a lot about it. We heard about it from relatives, uncles and such,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>, one of the <ORGANIZATION> Penn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> designers. The designers, who interviewed many Korean War veterans for the project, range in age from their 30s to their early 50s. The project is unlikely to cause the stir created by the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> memorial, said <PERSON> Veronica </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>, who is one of the four designers and is <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>' wife. `` To the general population, it's not likely to cause controversy. We hope that's the case,'' she said. `` But we were n't looking to make a non-controversial memorial We were thinking in terms of meeting the stated purpose and creating a significant experience for anyone visiting, to evoke an awareness on the part of any visitor.'' Korean War veterans have lobbied for a memorial since 1982, and at one time a group was pushing for a design by <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Weldon </PERSON>, who designed the Iwo Jima monument. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> passed legislation last year to erect the privately financed memorial on the Mall. Contributors to the memorial include the VFW, and the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. Even before seeing the design, <ORGANIZATION> VFW </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said the detailed screening process left him confident that the final product would have the `` 100 percent support'' of the veterans' group.

<HEAD>Survey: Many Employers Have Workers With AIDS But Most Lack AIDS
Policies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A survey of employee health plans shows nearly 60 percent of employers who offer health insurance have had AIDS cases among workers or covered dependents but just 25 percent have formal AIDS policies. An overwhelming majority of employers surveyed, 92 percent, said they had not modified their medical benefits plans because of AIDS. But 3 percent said they had altered the plan and 5 percent planned to do so by the end of this year. Of those employers who had or planned to modify benefit plans, 56 percent said the changes included or would include an AIDS education campaign, 48 percent said they had or would limit coverage and 23 percent added or planned to add pre-employment testing for the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome. The survey, conducted by benefits consultant <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> last August and released this week, gathered information on medical benefits policy from more than 1,600 employers with work forces ranging from 700 people to more than 40,000 employees. Combined, the employers surveyed had more than 10 million workers. Not all employers answered all of the questions in the survey _ some simply chose not to do so while some questions were not applicable to certain employers _ so the sample group varied from issue to issue. The employers surveyed represent a broad spectrum of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industry and business, and were from every region of the country. Of 651 employers who responded when asked about cases of AIDS among employees or dependents covered by their health plans, 58 percent said `` yes'' and 42 percent said `` no.'' The average number of AIDS cases reported was four. Employers in the <LOCATION> Mid-Atlantic </LOCATION> region were most likely to report at least one AIDS case among workers or plan-covered dependents, 73 percent reported at least one case, while employers in the north central region of the country _ 12 <ORGANIZATION> Midwestern </ORGANIZATION> states _ were least likely to report AIDS among workers or their dependents, with 47 percent reporting cases. Communications and transportation services were the industries with the highest rate of employer-reported AIDS cases among workers and insured dependents, with 82 percent of employers in those fields reporting at least one AIDS case covered by their benefit plans. The lowest rate was reported by employers in health care services, 30 percent of whom reported at least one case of AIDS covered by their medical insurance. Not surprisingly, larger employers were more likely to have workers or dependents with AIDS than smaller employers. Twenty-one percent of employers with fewer than 1,000 workers reported at least one AIDS case among employees or their dependents while 89 percent of employers with 10,000 to 19,999 employees reported cases, 96 percent with 20,000 to 39,999 workers reported cases and 98 percent of employers with 40,000 or more employees reported cases.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> says economic chaos is forcing him to resign five months before his term ends, and President-elect <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> said today he is willing to assume office early. `` We are willing, totally willing, to assume the direction of the Argentine republic on that date, and my hope is that the president of the nation will put on me the presidential sash,'' <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> said Monday evening he would leave office on June 30 because of <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s economic crisis and his inability to handle it, given his party's loss to <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> in the May national elections. `` The government's room for action during the months that remain of its mandate is too narrow to face the problems with a chance for success,'' <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> told the nation in a televised address. But <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>, a populist champion of the working poor, said he was taken by surprise by the announcement and said it would be `` impossible'' for him to take office five months early. He said that it require legislation that could not be enacted in time. It looked likely at that point that <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>'s younger brother, <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON>, who is provisional president of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, would act as interim president until <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>'s change of heart today. The six-year term of <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>, whose civilian administration replaced a discredited military dictatorship, officially ends Dec. 10. <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>'s address followed days of talks between the governing <ORGANIZATION> Radical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Peronist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. On May 14, the <ORGANIZATION> Peronist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> won the presidency for just the second time in 34 years and attained virtual control of both houses of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The party already controled legislatures in 17 of <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s 22 provinces. Because <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>, 58, and <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>, 62, have disagreed on how to improve the economy, little has been done to curtail inflation, which hit 78.5 percent in May. Interest rates and unemployment also continue to rise. The economic problems have been fueled by <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s $ 59 billion foreign debt. Problems in repaying the debt and meeting demands by foreign creditors also caused rioting in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> in February, and have been blamed for instability in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and other Latin American nations. The independent news agency <ORGANIZATION> Diarios </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> y </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Noticias </ORGANIZATION> cited another reason for the resignation of <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>, who had been barred by the constitution from seeking a second term. It quoted unidentified government sources as saying <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> was trying to pressure <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> into granting amnesty to officers who led three barracks revolts during his tenure and to others convicted of human rights abuses during the military dictatorship's `` dirty war'' against leftists from 1976-83. `` The insistence ... prompted the government to decide to announce its departure,'' DyN quoted the sources as saying. `` -LRB- <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> -RRB- does not want an amnesty.'' A former president and army commander, Gen. <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Videla </PERSON>, and seven other top officers were convicted of human rights abuses committed during the seven-year dictatorship, when at least 8,961 people were arrested, never seen again and presumed executed. Human rights groups claim the death toll is much higher. The armed forces claims it used unconventional tactics to fight an unconventional enemy and save <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s democracy. The military returned to the barracks after presiding over an economic collapse, losing the 1982 Falklands War to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and encountering worldwide condemnation over its human rights policies.

 A possible plan for establishing an autonomous ethnic German settlement in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has ignited hopes for stemming the westward flow of Soviet Germans. Soviet officials have given contradictory reports on the likelihood of a German region emerging. A designated zone that could trade freely with the West would offer a unique foundation on which to build Soviet-German business ties. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> told journalists covering Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s visit to <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> that one proposal calls for establishing an ethnic German region in <LOCATION> Kaliningrad </LOCATION>. Now a pocket of the Russian republic wedged between <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> on the Baltic coast, <LOCATION> Kaliningrad </LOCATION> was known as <PERSON> Koenigsberg </PERSON> prior to its transfer to Soviet control after World War II. As the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> has relaxed restrictions on the emigration of those with German ancestry, tens of thousands of ethnic Germans have abandoned their Soviet homes to settle in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Many of the emigres stem from German settlers who went to <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> 300 years ago in the time of Peter the Great, and their assimilation into modern West German society has been difficult and costly for the <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> government. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s constitution recognizes a right by all people of German nationality to return to their homeland, and massive outlays for housing, language instruction and work training have been necessary to help the Soviet Germans get settled. About 50,000 Soviet Germans arrived in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in 1988. Asked if the idea of an autonomous region for Soviet Germans came up during <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s talks with West German leaders Monday, <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> government spokesman <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> said it had not. But he added the subject `` lies close to the heart'' of West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>. `` I can assure you this development will be a very important subject in the discussions to be conducted,'' <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said the idea of an autonomous German region within the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> `` is one of a number of possibilities'' under discussion as a means of helping those of German origin to retain their ethnic traditions. A designated autonomous region for Soviet Jews was established in the Siberian region of <LOCATION> Birobidzhan </LOCATION> in the 1930s, but today its Jewish population is a minority. Large groups of Soviet Germans are settled in the <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> republic of <LOCATION> Kazakhstan </LOCATION>, where they were forcibly relocated from the <LOCATION> Volga </LOCATION> region and <LOCATION> Bessarabia </LOCATION> by dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> before and during World War II. <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said earlier that one idea under discussion as a means of improving conditions for Soviet Germans is to allow them to establish their own region within the country. He said one location under consideration is the <LOCATION> Kaliningrad </LOCATION> area because it is relatively undeveloped and sparcely populated. <LOCATION> Kaliningrad </LOCATION> remains a closed region within the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, presumably because it has a number of strategic naval bases on the Baltic coast. <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said officials looking into ways of countering the trend toward emigration came up with the proposal, and that they have even put forward a possible name for the region. `` They could call it Kantograd,'' he said, in honor of the 18th century German philosopher <PERSON> Immanuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Kant </PERSON>, the most famous figure to have emerged from the region. However, a <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> adviser on German affairs suggested the idea of an autonomous German zone within the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> remains `` speculative.'' `` Everyone has the right to speculate on how to solve problems, but there is no such formal proposal,'' said <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Portugalov </PERSON>, also in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> for the summit. Establishing a special German zone would give West Germans eager to help develop a stronger trade base in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> a logical place to invest in joint ventures or other cooperative endeavors. But a free-trading autonomous region on the Baltic coast might be troubling to neighboring <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, as well as <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> members who might view a Soviet-German region as a precarious attraction for <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. It could also be negative for <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, since it would almost certainly boost the resolve of the Baltic republics to gain independence from the Kremlin.

 Forty-four veterans hospitals had `` significantly elevated'' rates of death among patients, and more than five percent of those who died were found to have received inappropriate care, according to a <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> report issued today. Veterans Affairs Secretary <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON>, who ordered the report released today, cautioned in a letter to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that `` no general statement about the quality of care'' in veterans' hospitals `` can be drawn from these findings.'' Nonetheless, <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> said, `` we must try to do better.'' The report is based on a review of 1,771 deaths in 1986 among patients at the 172 VA medical centers around the country. Medical records for the dead patients were reviewed by several levels of evaluators and judged against a scale of predicted death based on several factors, such as patient age, condition and type of illness. From this study, the report concludes that 44 medical centers had `` significantly elevated mortality rates for at least one of four'' patient categories. Twelve of these 44 centers had overall death rates that were `` significantly elevated.'' Fifteen of the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> medical centers were judged to have mortality rates lower than expected. Evaluators ordered 123 of the 1,771 cases to be reviewed by a group of doctors not associated with the VA hospitals, a system called peer review. Of the 123 cases examined in detail, two groups of peer reviewers found 90 cases in which the care given was not consistent with current medical practice. `` The agreement of two peer reviewers on these 90 cases makes it appropriate to describe them as having ` likely' quality of care problems,'' the report said. The VA hospitals with higher-than-predicted death rates were identified as those veterans' medical centers in these cities: <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La </LOCATION>.; <LOCATION> Asheville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>.; <LOCATION> Battle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Biloxi </LOCATION>, Miss.; <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Chillicothe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>, S.

<HEAD>Socialists Surge Ahead in Election Campaign on Thatcher Factor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUREEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 After 10 years of Conservative government by Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, it has been a while since her opponents have relished an election. But this is it. In the campaign for the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>'s parliamentary elections Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has surged ahead, the <ORGANIZATION> Tories </ORGANIZATION> are on the defensive and there's only one issue: Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> Labor has turned the election into a referendum on the Thatcher decade _ with emphasis on the charge that she is a reluctant European, fighting each step toward a <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> that conforms in everything from a single currency to the size of health warnings on cigarette packs. The Conservatives also face strong challenges in by-elections Thursday to fill two vacant British parliamentary seats in <LOCATION> Glasgow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. In the European elections, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> voters will choose 78 representatives to the 518-member Parliament. The body's limited powers include approving trade agreements involving <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> members. The elections come as Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> is taking on the community's administrative headquarters in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, which she says wants to impose `` socialism by the back door'' on the 12-nation EEC She is particularly angered by a proposed <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> `` social charter'' that would provide for Europe-wide minimum wages and worker representation in industry. `` We have not rolled back the frontiers of socialism in this country to see them reimposed from <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>,'' she said at an election rally on Friday. `` Labor wring their hands and protest that we're far too combative,'' she said. `` What do they want, a doormat?'' The audience cheered. But the government is in increasing trouble over strikes and rising inflation. Labor recently revamped its platform, moving to the center and dropping its policy of unilateral nuclear disarmament, a big vote-loser. Now the party is on the attack. So is Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s Tory predecessor, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Heath </PERSON>, an ardent European who accuses her of misleading the public with `` absolute nonsense'' about moves toward socialism by the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> that governs the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>. Some less prominent Conservatives also are uneasy about the Thatcher style in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` Should we really have to block every <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> proposal on principle?'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Welsh </PERSON>, a Tory member of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. `` It simply is n't true that a lot of leftist loonies are running the show.'' The Economist, a respected weekly, said Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s prickly attitude toward continental <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> could backfire on <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s strong friendship with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` For the Americans it is no use having a special relationship with a sulky outsider,'' The Economist said. Many Europeans believe Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> is a British nationalist who is only interested in the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>'s economic benefits. She responds that she dares to say aloud what others secretly believe: that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> is a pipe dream. In <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, bashing what Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> still calls `` the Europeans'' has never been a vote-loser. The <ORGANIZATION> Tories </ORGANIZATION>' balance-sheet approach to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> is reflected in their main newspaper campaign ad, which crows that since 1984 the Tory government has won about $ 7.6 billion in refunds from <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> coffers. The bulk of the refunds came after <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> won arguments over the size of its contributions to the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>. Defending Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Minogue </PERSON>, professor of politics at the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION>, said: `` She just does n't want a highly regulated, mercantilist, absolutist fortress <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. That's what she's attacking. In the last European election in 1984, the Conservatives won 45 of mainland <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s 78 seats in the <ORGANIZATION> Strasbourg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> 32 and the Scottish <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> one. This time, analysts expect the Conservatives to lose four to five seats to the socialists. The latest Gallup poll, a huge survey of 9,000 voters, gave <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> 43.5 percent of the vote, a 7-point lead over the Conservatives and the opposition party's highest rating for eight years. All parties share the biggest battle of all in a European vote in this island nation: apathy, which in the 1984 Euro-election produced the lowest turnout in the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>, 32 percent. But Gallup showed Labor with a 15-point lead among those who said they were certain to vote.

 County governments employ more than a quarter-million teachers. the largest segment of employees by counties, the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> reported Tuesday. Overall, the nation's counties had a total of 1,962,711 employees as of October 1987, the most recent detailed figures available, the bureau said.

Leading in growth rate was the 12.4 percent jump in county corrections workers to 114,407. There was a 5.5 percent increase in firefighters, to 21,175, and a 6.5 percent increase in water workers, to 9,076.

 Sluggish automobile and department store purchases slowed the pace of retail sales in May to a weak 0.1 percent increase, the government reported Tuesday, and analysts said they do not expect much improvement soon. `` I think this is what the pattern will be like as we look forward,'' said <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Chimerine </PERSON>, an economist with the <ORGANIZATION> WEFA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> in <PERSON> Bala </PERSON> <PERSON> Cynwyd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION> `` I do n't think you'll see a big retrenchment, but there wo n't be much growth in consumer spending ... for several years.'' <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON>, an econmist with the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, agreed, saying, `` I think it -LRB- the retail sales report -RRB- reinforces what is now and probably will continue to be a much more cautious consumer throughout the balance of the business expansion.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said retail sales increased to $ 141.1 billion on a seasonally adjusted basis last month after rising a strong 1 percent in April and 0.1 percent in March. But the April increase included a 2 percent boost in auto sales due to rebates and low interest rates designed to lure buyers into dealer showrooms. Despite the extension of the incentives into May, car sales increased only 0.2 percent last month. Auto sales rose only 0.5 percent in March. Autos represent about 20 percent of all retail sales. Also hit by the slowing economy were department store and general merchandise sales, which fell 1.2 percent in May following an 0.8 percent rise in April. Specialty clothing sales were off 1.4 percent after a 3.9 percent jump the preceeding month. The economy has been slowing and, until recently, interest rates rising as the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> applied the brakes in an attempt to stem inflation. But as inflation seemed to slow and amid worries the economy could slide into a recession, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> slightly eased pressures on interest rates this month. Nevertheless, analysts say interest rates and inflation continue to be a factor in consumer spending. Also, in recent years, consumers have taken on a large amount of debt to buy cars and other big-ticket durable items expected to last more than three years. `` Some of the huge pent-up demand for cars and other durables which existed five or six years ago has been used up to some extent,'' <PERSON> Chimerine </PERSON> said. `` People borrowed heavily and spent for a number of years and now we're on the down side of that cycle and it could take a long time before we see a major revival in spending.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said sales of durable goods rose 0.3 percent in May, down from a 1.8 percent hike in April that included the incentive-driven boost in auto sales. Non-durable goods sales were level in May after a 0.6 percent increase the previous month. Sales in the food and grocery store category were up 0.5 percent in May; gasoline service stations, up 0.9 percent, and drug stores, up 1.8 percent. Bar and restaurant sales were down 0.4 percent, while building material and furniture sales were flat. The department said overall retail sales were up 5 percent for the three months from March through May, compared with the same period of 1988.

 Army medical officers were deployed to state hospitals and clinics to treat emergency cases Tuesday, the second day of a nationwide strike by junior government doctors. Public Service Minister of State <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON> warned the strikers they will be prosecuted if they do n't return to work Wednesday.

You can not riddle a people's yearning with bullets. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was addressing The English Speaking Union in the Guildhall, the 1,000-year-old seat of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> city government, where he spoke as president 13 months ago and where <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> gave a speech in April. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, on his first visit to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> since leaving the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, mixed jokes and reminiscences with a sweeping vision of a world where `` The Goliath of totalitarian control will rapidly be brought down by the <PERSON> David </PERSON> of the microchip.'' `` I believe <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> realizes these things,'' said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` I believe <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is the Soviets' best and probably only hope to turn things around,'' `` It is true that the West could stand pat while this is happening. We are not the ones who must change. It is not our people who're isolated from the information that allows them to be creative and productive,'' he said. `` But it is exactly when you are strong and comfortable that you should take risks.'' He said: `` I believe we should take the risk that the Soviets are serious in their efforts to reach genuine arms reductions with the West. I support President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal to keep pressure on the Soviets to make good on their calls to reduce arms.'' `` The biggest of <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> is increasingly helpless against communications technology,'' he said. `` Information is the oxygen of the modern age. ... It seeps through the walls topped with barbed wire. It wafts across the electrified booby-trapped borders. Breezes of electronic beams blow through the Iron Curtain as if it was lace.'' He said that as long as the Soviets restricted the flow by such measures as banning the unauthorized use of photocopiers, the West should go on refusing to sell the Soviets modern computers. `` When the Soviets are willing to allow their own people to have computers and telephones and copiers and the other devices of information, then we should rethink our objections to what we'll sell them,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said `` Amazing things are afoot in the world this spring,'' he said. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> had held its first semi-free election in 40 years; <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> was moving to multiparty democracy; Soviet dissident <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> sat in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, and in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, `` those heroic <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> students who gave their lives have released the spirit of democracy and it can not be called back,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. Answering a reporter's question about <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> as he left the Guildhall, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said: `` I think the students were right and we should do everything we can to help.'' In his speech, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> joked about the pleasures of addressing an English-speaking audience, recalling an embarrassing episode in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> when he enthusiastically applauded a speech in Spanish, which he did n't understand, only to discover that he was listening to the translation of the speech he had just given. Another joke was about East German leader <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoenecker </PERSON> meeting a beautiful woman and offering to grant her every wish. She asks him to tear down the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall, to which he replies: `` I know; you want to be alone with me.'' <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>'s Peerage, which chronicles the British aristocracy, said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has accepted the offer of an honorary knighthood, the highest royal honor <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> bestows on Americans. But Buckingham Palace and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s press spokesman, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberg </PERSON>, refused to confirm or deny the report. After dinner with Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> on Tuesday night, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, are to have lunch with Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> at the palace Wednesday. `` We understand it has been offered and will be accepted either this trip or his next trip, which is expected to be next spring,'' said <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks-Baker </PERSON>, publishing director of <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>'s Peerage.

 A Star Wars experiment to test how a neutral particle beam accelerator would work in space was aborted Tuesday when a rocket failed to ignite on command. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s chief spokesman, said the so-called BEAR experiment at White Sands Missile Range in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> had been postponed until next month while technicians tried to determine what went wrong. `` There was a problem with the Aires booster,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. `` The missile did not fire and that's all I can tell you about that. `` And so the launch was aborted. The <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Initiative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> hopes to reschedule the launch for mid-July.'' The BEAR _ or <ORGANIZATION> Beam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Experiment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aboard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rocket </ORGANIZATION> _ has been planned for more than a year and is considered a key step in the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s research to explore futuristic weapons that could shoot powerful beams of atomic particles across space The experiment involved the lifting into space _ just for a few minutes _ of a neutral particle beam accelerator atop a small Aires rocket. Before the rocket returned to earth, the accelerator would be turned on and scientists would collect data on how it worked and how the particle beams moved. The total flight was to last only about 15 minutes. The Star Wars office at the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday it was too early to gauge exactly what went wrong at White Sands, but that the problem clearly involved `` a malfunction in the rocket and not the payload.'' The Star Wars program is a research effort to develop lasers, beam accelerators and other futuristic weapons that could be used to automatically shoot down nuclear missiles fired at the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> or its allies. The Pentagon and <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> are spending $ 4 billion on such research this year.

 The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and the American consulate in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, the largest city in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, soon will begin issuing temporary visas to Chinese seeking to leave the troubled country, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announced today. It was not immediately clear whether authorities who have been cracking down on dissenters and other pro-democracy forces will permit a significant exodus. But department spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> `` will do what is necessary'' to process aplications. Troops surround the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, the capital, in an apparent effort to prevent students and others sought by authorities from taking refuge there with dissident <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> <PERSON> Lizhi </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Shuxian </PERSON>. However, Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said she was `` not aware of any harassment of people standing in line.'' The spokeswoman said the embassy and consulate would begin issuing limited non-immigrant visas on Wednesday. These usually are for temporary visits and require either an invitation from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> or a specific event the applicant wishes to attend. Students sought by the police were thought unlikely to apply because they would expose themselves to arrest. Also, they would need the approval of their schools to get a temporary visas. Until now, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consulate in <LOCATION> Guangzhou </LOCATION>, formerly <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION>, has been the only <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> post to issue immigrant visas to Chinese applicants. Meanwhile, Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> held an unannounced meeting Monday with Chinese Ambassador <PERSON> Han </PERSON> <PERSON> Xu </PERSON> at the envoy's request. She declined to provide any details, but apparently the meeting dealt with the two dissidents sheltered in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> and efforts to arrange their departure from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The spokeswoman again criticized the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government for continuing arrests of critics of the regime. She said the arrests were `` very disturbing'' and called on authorities to respond with dialogue instead of repression to the dissidents. On the offensive Monday, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> sharply criticized <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and paramount leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiao-ping </PERSON> even while trying to work out a diplomatic solution for the two sheltered dissidents. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> condemnation challenged Chinese disavowals that hundreds of students were shot dead by Army troops in <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>. `` The whole world has seen what happened,'' Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said. `` Large numbers of peaceful demonstrators were killed by army units. We condemn the use of live fire against unarmed civilians, which is what happened in Tiananmen Square.'' Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said the Chinese had strengthened security around the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy to prevent other dissidents from joining <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> and <PERSON> Li </PERSON>, and were jamming Voice of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> broadcasts. At the same time, she had sharp words for <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>, who emerged Friday from more than three weeks of seclusion with praise for the army's suppression of pro-democracy forces. His performance cast doubt on <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s reputation as a cautious but ardent advocate of reform of the Marxist system. Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said if <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> `` was responsible for the brutal attack on Tiananmen Square, then he has acted to undercut the very reform process he has sought to foster. That is a tragedy for <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, its people and the legacy he sought to pass on.''

 In some parts of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, what chef <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickson </PERSON> does with catfish and collard greens probably is unheard of. But creativity was the key as Southern cooking afficionados gathered here for the first <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Festival </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> brought out the good silverware and its members ate the night away, singing the praises of Southern chefs. It was a weekend of indulgence that left fans of food and drink stuffed to the gills. It was only natural that the chefs showcase typical Southern dishes with gourmet twists that made diners mighty proud of that good eatin' below the Mason-Dixon line. There was catfish, which <PERSON> Dickson </PERSON>, chef-owner of <PERSON> Robert </PERSON>'s of <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, smoked and covered with a creamy sauce. He whipped a batch of collard greens into a delicate souffle. Diners were delighted, and <PERSON> Dickson </PERSON> _ armed with a booming, operatic tenor _ broke into song. `` FOOD, glo-ri-ous FOOD!'' he bellowed. `` It's FOOD, GLO-RI-OUS FOOD!! WON-der-ful FOOD!!'' From the tentative first nibbles of venison rib, summer squash cake and fried oyster appetizers, to the garlic cumin bread, turtle soup, pork cut thick like Porterhouse steaks with homemade fruit relishes, grilled quail salad, <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> cream cake with peach and raspberry puree, right down to the last sip of wine made from the native muscadine grape, Dixie dining as social legend was celebrated. `` We use food as a focal point. Churches have used it, schools have used it, communities have used it,'' said speaker <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentley </PERSON>, an expert on Southern traditions. `` We had this rural geography, this rural population, this agricultural economy, we had no population concentrations, and the food we had was the food that was available.'' `` Grilled duck ... black-eyed peas and rice, which to you and me is Hoppin' <PERSON> John </PERSON>; muscadine preserves and muscadine wine. Put that combination together and it'd blow you aloose when you taste it,'' <PERSON> Bentley </PERSON> said. `` Now that's what you do with poultry ...'' <PERSON> Bentley </PERSON> did n't hold back as he regaled the audience with various uses for Southern foodstuffs, including one used by a physician from <LOCATION> Upson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>: `` He required that his patients chew the stems of collard leaves as an antidote for jaundice,'' <PERSON> Bentley </PERSON> said. `` We grew vegetables because they had all sorts of advantages like this.'' The spirit of culinary camaraderie carried over to the kitchen, where cooking secrets were traded among visiting chefs, among them <PERSON> Dickson </PERSON>; cooking show host <PERSON> Nathalie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dupree </PERSON>; <PERSON> Edna </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, cookbook author and longtime authority on Southern food; and <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>, chef-owner of <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> on 37th in <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION> `` Nobody was holding back,'' chef <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> said between compliments on his squash cakes. `` Everybody was sharing secrets. That was the beauty of it.'' Ms. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, currently consultant and chef of <PERSON> Gage </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tollner </PERSON> Restaurant in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, said Southern food catches on nationally because few people truly realize what it is. `` They call it American food, but it's really Southern food,'' she said. `` A lot of New Yorkers love it.'' As dishes were being carted back to the kitchen, the 50 or so diners began heading home under the influence of another quality of Southern food. `` I'm really getting sleepy,'' said <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Peacock </PERSON>, a chef at the <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> governor's mansion. `` I may have to pull over on the way home and check into a motel or something.''

 The government flashed pictures of 21 pro-democracy activists on national television Tuesday and said the students were wanted for leading a counterrevolutionary rebellion. `` Every province, region, city, police department, railway bureau, airline and transportation organ is asked to prevent them from escaping,'' the television and radio report said. The government also put border guards on alert to prevent the escape of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s leading dissident, <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> <PERSON> Lizhi </PERSON>, and his wife, <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Shuxian </PERSON>, who were accused of counterrevolutionary propaganda but not on the wanted list. They were in hiding at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. Among the students on the wanted list was <PERSON> Wu'er </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaixi </PERSON>, who told Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> in a televised meeting in May that he should `` stop beating around the bush'' because <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> faced a political crisis. The television report also showed footage taken by a hidden camera of the charismatic student leader and friends eating at a `` high-class hotel'' and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> TV footage of him addressing rallies for democracy and a freer society. <PERSON> Li </PERSON>, who played a leading role in crushing the seven weeks of protests, told a meeting of top officials Tuesday the army had won only an `` initial victory'' when it cleared student demonstrators from <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> on June 3-4. `` At present our task is to restore order and strike relentless blows at the counterrevolutionary rebels,'' the official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Li </PERSON> as saying. Chinese witnesses and Western intelligence sources say as many as 3,000 people were killed when the government turned army troops on unarmed residents. The Chinese government has said nearly 300 people died, mostly soldiers. Streets adjoining Tiananmen Square were reopened to car and bicycle traffic Tuesday, although no stopping was allowed and pedestrians remained barred. Missing from the meeting with <PERSON> Li </PERSON> were <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON> and high-level party official <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Qili </PERSON>, moderates who reportedly opposed the crackdown and were stripped of their power by conservatives led by senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> also said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> would not yield to foreign pressure to change its policy toward the protesters. `` We hope that all countries that wish to keep and develop friendly relations with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> will take a long-term view and avoid doing anything to hurt the feelings of the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> people,'' he said. Many countries, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, have condemned <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> for ordering its army to fire on the students and supporters. Several countries have recalled their ambassadors in protest, but none has broken ties. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration indicated it wo n't allow <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> and his wife to be arrested. International law forbids Chinese authorities from entering the embassy compound, which is regarded as American soil, without <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> permission. <PERSON> Fang </PERSON>, an astrophysicist, did not play an active role in the pro-democracy movement. But he has long been an outspoken human rights advocate, criticizing Marxism and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s top leaders. Even before the army action, many top student leaders went into hiding. The <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> newspaper reported Tuesday that some student leaders had surrendered, but it gave no names.

In addition to Wu'er, it included <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> history student <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Chai </PERSON> <PERSON> Ling </PERSON>, one of only two women on the list, who sent a tape from hiding that was broadcast last week by <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. The list accused the 21 students of `` inciting and organizing counterrevolutionary rebellion in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>,'' and contained details about their height, hair and other features. Chinese television has more than doubled its usual 30-minute news program on recent nights to show the arrests of more than 1,000 workers and unemployed youth nationwide for alleged participation in anti-government demonstrations. The government announced the arrest of a second <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> resident in connection with the protests. <LOCATION> Guangdong </LOCATION> provincial radio in the southeast said <PERSON> Guo </PERSON> <PERSON> Wenshen </PERSON> was arrested in <LOCATION> Shaoguan </LOCATION> city after posting `` reactionary slogans'' on poles. Another <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> student was arrested at the <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> airport on Sunday and accused of leading an illegal student organization. The government regards Chinese residents of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> as Chinese citizens, even though <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> will not return the colony to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> until 1997. In the first official indication of possible discontent within the army, <LOCATION> Jilin </LOCATION> provincial radio reported that soldiers of an unidentified army unit had pledged in writing to `` learn from troops supporting the crackdown'' and to `` abide by orders.'' The radio report, monitored by the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION>, did not say what prompted the written pledges. There were small skirmishes last week between troops carrying out the crackdown and soldiers opposed to it, but there was no large-scale opposition and by week's end the army gave an appearance of unity. The army's presence in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> remained strong Tuesday. More than 50 tanks and armored personnel vehicles remained parked at the north and south ends of <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, and soldiers with rifles stood every 15 feet along the plaza's perimeter. <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Radio advised residents not to talk with soldiers, who have been told they can use their weapons in self-defense and shoot or take any other measures necessary to stop criminal activity.

 A former federal housing official, identified as a key figure in investigations of a low-income housing program criticized for mismanagement and favoritism, refused today to answer questions from a congressional panel. Invoking her rights against self-incrimination, <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>, onetime executive assistant to former housing secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, declined to answer questions about her involvement in the process to select which projects would be funded by the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>'s Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation Program. `` In view of my present inability to obtain access to the <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> records which would enable me to give accurately testimony that would be complete and truthful, I respectfully have decided to decline to answer any questions posed by the subcommittee at this time on the basis of the rights guaranteed to me under the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>, the sole witness to be subpoenaed by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Government Operations subcommittee on employment and housing, is also the only one who has refused to testify. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> was accompanied by two attorneys, including former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joseph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> DiGenova </ORGANIZATION>. Panel chairman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON>, D-Calif., told <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> he and the subcommittee would assist her in obtaining the documents she needed But Rep. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>, D-Conn., questioned whether the extensive list of documents requested by her attorneys, including all of <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s phone logs and appointments between January 1984 and December 1988, was reasonable Earlier, another <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> official told congressional investigators that political influence was involved in the program's selection process. <PERSON> Silvio </PERSON> <PERSON> DeBartolomeis </PERSON>, former general deputy assistant secretary in the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> and acting commissioner of housing, said that he `` left town'' to avoid signing documents approving funding for two projects under <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation Program. `` I did n't intend to sign them'' without the recommendation of career employees, <PERSON> DeBartolomeis </PERSON> told the But he said he was subsequently ordered to sign the documents by <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>. `` I would have to say that there were political influences involved,'' <PERSON> DeBartolomeis </PERSON> said in describing the program. It has come under congressional scrutiny since a <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> inspector general's investigative audit found several appointees of former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> profited as consultants to many projects that received federal funds <PERSON> DeBartolomeis </PERSON> said `` the people that were politically connected'' were the ones who profited from the program. `` I never really was part of that selection process,'' he added. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> has testified that he had set up a three-person selection committee composed of DeBartolomeis, <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> and a department undersecretary. <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> said in his opening statement that the investigation into the program `` has opened a can of worms at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>.'' He said recent revelations that private escrow agents may have diverted millions of dollars from sales of <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> foreclosure properties indicated `` <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> decided that those <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> programs which could not be killed by budget slashing could be killed by neglect.'' <PERSON> DeBartolomeis </PERSON> said that one of his concerns about the moderate rehabilitation program was that career <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> staffers, whom he had come to respect and depend on, were not involved in the decision-making. `` I felt that it could be viewed that these were being done in a political manner,'' said <PERSON> DeBartolomeis </PERSON>. He said he expressed his concerns to <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>, whom he viewed `` as the final decision-maker.''

 House Democrats campaigned down to the wire Tuesday as they sought to complete their top leadership team and begin to restore order to a chamber distracted for months by ethics charges. Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, who ran unsuccessfully for president last year, was favored in the race for majority leader, while three Democrats were battling for the post of majority whip in a contest clouded by reports of an investigation of one candidate's office staff. The Democratic caucus, the 259-member organization of all House Democrats, will vote by secret ballot Wednesday to fill the second-and third-ranking positions. The new majority leader will succeed Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., who was sworn in as speaker of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> last week <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> replaced <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, who was driven out by allegations of financial impropriety. The new whip will take the place of Rep. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, D-Calif., who is leaving <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> Thursday over questions about his personal finances <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, is expected to win the No. 2 spot, though he does have opposition from <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, who ran in an effort to give Southerners and conservatives a greater voice in a generally liberal top echelon. In the whip's race, the lineup is tighter. Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> is considered to have a slight but shrinking edge over <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonior </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> is chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION>, while <PERSON> Bonior </PERSON> has been <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>'s chief deputy. Also running, but far behind, is <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, chairman of the party's <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> political campaign arm. The whip contest has been touched by news reports of an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigation into whether there was a no-work `` ghost employee'' on <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>'s congressional staff. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said this week that <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> himself is not a target of the probe. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Abbe </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON>, said the congressman met last week with <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents and will continue to cooperate. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said he did not believe the reports would affect the race. `` I think the statement -LRB- by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- was a clear one and the race is going to be judged on its own merits,'' he told reporters. The leadership shakeup, no matter how it comes out, represents what Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Obey </PERSON>, D-Wis., called `` the moving of a new generation of political power into this place. The new team will be more telegenic, more pragmatic, more interested in bipartisan consensus. `` I think it means more focus on the nitty-gritty, day-to-day management issues,'' particularly on matters affecting the nation's economy, <PERSON> Obey </PERSON> said `` The team that's shaping up is going to be a doggone effective team, and people are going to feel good about it. Sometimes in the darkest storms you do have silver linings.'' But some Democrats fear the new team also may lack in the political gut-fighting instincts that characterized <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, and especially <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>. `` I felt I was on the starting team, and was one of the stars,'' <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> said. `` But you remove one of the starters, and the team adjusts. Somebody's going to do the political work, because it needs to be done, and there's recognition for it, and the caucus is going to demand it.'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> would bring his campaign-honed media savvy to the visible No. 2 job, as well as some luster from his having sought the presidency. He has told supporters he is putting aside presidential ambitions and is instead putting himself into the long-term line to be speaker. <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>, a popular insider who is a member of the tax-writing <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, was still in the race on Tuesday, but was said to be reassessing his bid. Members were sympathetic to his call for greater representation for the party's conservative Southern wing, and there was talk of creation of a special post for someone from that group. `` After we've seen the caucus elections, ... we'll have a chance to examine whether any appointments might be made that would provide some additional balance in the leadership,'' said <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>.

 Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> on Tuesday challenged West German industrialists to bet on his reforms with new investments that could reinforce an era of better political relations. `` If the Federal Republic wishes to secure access to Soviet markets, it should begin by offering strategic projects rather than trifles,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told several hundred business leaders. He criticized the West's restrictions on transfer of high technology to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and what he said is the unwillingness of many West German businesses to import Soviet products. Despite the criticism, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was greeted warmly by members of the German <ORGANIZATION> East-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, and received a standing ovation as he left. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> already is the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s largest Western trading partner, with an annual trade turnover of $ 7.5 billion to $ 10 billion. German manufacturers provide machinery for Soviet heavy industry as well as manufacture of consumer goods and food processing, all of which <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> desperately needs to modify the Soviet economy. The meeting with the business leaders was a key event for <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in his four-day visit as he tries to work out ways to meet Soviets' increasingly vocal demands that his reform program improve their daily lives. But he has little room to maneuver. Premier <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> said last week the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> can not afford to boost imports of consumer goods because of its budget deficit and poor balance of payments. Nevertheless, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said the level of Soviet-West German trade was `` laughably low'' and that the assets of Soviet-West German joint ventures could be increased drastically. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> pledged the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> would n't back away from economic reform, including taming its big bureaucracy. But he said his reforms need time. Moving too fast to create what he calls a `` socialist market economy'' and make the ruble convertible would lead to economic chaos, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. `` We do n't need that, and you do n't either,'' he told the finance and industrial leaders. The inability to take rubles earned in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> out of the country as profits is one of the main problems that discourages Western businesses. He defended the quality of Soviet research, and proposed that Soviet scientists carry out projects for <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in return for technology. He proposed that German businesses help the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> convert defense industries to peaceful uses, cooperate in building ships and planes, and noted that talks are under way on developing economic zones in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolff </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Amerongen </PERSON>, chairman of the trade group, told <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> that joint ventures with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> have limited appeal for West German business. `` We should not overestimate them as a business instrument,'' <PERSON> Amerongen </PERSON> said. `` In your country they are occasionally thought to be a wonder weapon of foreign business reform.'' He added that the Soviet Union could not permanently end its economic slump without improving the quantity and quality of the finished goods it exports. Soviet exports now are dominated by raw materials such as oil, natural gas and timber. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said he was `` deeply satisfied'' with his two days of talks with Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> and other top political leaders. Both sides have said the talks are putting an end to a tradition of hostility and suspicion, and opening up broad possbilities for future cooperation. That is essential to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s vision for a `` common European home'' from the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Ural </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>. He stressed to the business leaders that they have a key role to play in further lessening those tensions. `` I ca n't imagine a common European home without firm economic ground beneath it,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. In order to establish that security, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> needs a long period of peaceful development, he said.

 A rescue helicopter searching a remote valley early today spotted the wreckage of a sightseeing plane that vanished Sunday with 11 people aboard, authorities said. There were no signs of survivors. Pieces of the twin-engine Beechcraft were strewn over the face of a cliff on <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>'s northeast coast, three miles from where aircraft had pinpointed an emergency radio signal on Monday, authorities said. Marines lowered themselves by ropes in an attempt to reach the crash site, said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON>. `` Debris is spread out over a 200 - to 300-meter area,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Maj. <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gershaneck </PERSON> `` There's nothing that our people see that would identify the wreckage as an aircraft. There is no sign of survivors.'' The Scenic Air Tours plane disappeared without indication of trouble Sunday during what was supposed to be an hour-long flight from <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Maui </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. The plane had left under partly sunny skies, carrying a pilot and 10 tourists. Heavy rain and strong winds on Monday prevented helicopters from searching the valley. A <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> helicopter had picked up the emergency signal from the <LOCATION> Waimanu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> region on the northeast side of <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. The valley is about four miles long with several major side valleys and has a 320-foot-high waterfall. It cuts deep into the 5,480-foot <LOCATION> Kohala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> and is thick with vegetation. The plane's last reported position was 10 miles north of <LOCATION> Hilo </LOCATION> and flying at 2,000 feet, according to <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON>. The plane passed out of radar contact at that point and would not have re-emerged on radar until it passed the island's northern tip. The names of those aboard, eight Americans and two Australians, will not be released until all their families have been notified, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Tom </PERSON>, the tour company's operations manager. The plane's 28-year-old pilot had about 4,000 hours flying experience and had flown the around-the-island tour about 50 times, according to <ORGANIZATION> Scenic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tours </ORGANIZATION> chief pilot, <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>. In 1987, a twin-engine <ORGANIZATION> Panorama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tours </ORGANIZATION> plane with eight people aboard disappeared without a trace on a flight from <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Molokai </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>.

 Despite its unilateral cuts, the Soviet military's `` overwhelming numbers'' still make it the world's biggest war machine and do n't back up <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> claims about a switch to defensive strategy, the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday `` Speaking candidly, it is rather difficult for Americans _ and those in many other countries _ to see how such a massive array of power is mandated by the legitimate needs of defense,'' Adm. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> told students and instructors at the <ORGANIZATION> Voroshilov </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON>, on an 11-day official visit to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, also suggested that instead of announcing more unilateral reductions, the Kremlin join the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in negotiating mutual cuts, even of modest scale _ a step he said would best promote progress in arms control. `` You'd be surprised at the effect it would have, and pave the way for more dramatic steps in the future,'' <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> told his Soviet audience. The 64-year-old admiral, accompanied by an entourage of top <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> brass and Gen. <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moiseyev </PERSON> _ his official host and head of the Soviet general staff _ also visited once secret military installations outside <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to examine weaponry. It was the latest in a series of high-level military visits designed to dispel mistrust between the superpowers. The visits began in July with one to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by Marshal <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Akhromeyev </PERSON>, then Soviet chief of staff. In August, then-Defense Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> visited the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. In a heavy rain, <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> and top <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military officers who accompanied him were shown a training version of a snub-nosed SS-19 missile in its silo at the <LOCATION> Balabanovo </LOCATION> base, where officer cadets are taught how to launch the ICBM the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> says can carry six nuclear warheads up to 6,200 miles. At the <LOCATION> Kubinka </LOCATION> air garrison, Soviet warplanes painted in camouflage, including the MiG-29 fighter and Su-24 attack aircraft, were parked on the tarmac for the admiral and his entourage to inspect. Like <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> also clambered up a metal ladder to board the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s newest long-range strategic bomber, the needle-nosed Tu-160, better known in the West by its <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> designation of `` Blackjack.'' After viewing the aircraft, <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> said he was very impressed. `` We're talking world-class aviation here,'' he said. Gen. <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, deputy chief of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, said all 10 Soviet warplanes and helicopters on display already had been seen by Westerners, some at international air shows or during <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>'s visit last year `` But to say many people have seen the Blackjack is an overstatement,'' <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> said. In a Dec. 7 speech to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> announced the Soviets unilaterally would cut their armed forces by 500,000 men, to 3.7 million. Last month, during a session of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, he also pledged defense spending would be cut by the equivalent of $ 15.3 billion by the end of 1991. Soviet officials say the reductions are in line with the new military doctrine, announced by the Soviet-led <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> in May 1987, of `` reasonable sufficiency,'' which stipulates that a country needs enough military might to repel an assailant, and no more. <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON>, in his speech at the academy on relations between the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet militaries, welcomed <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> declaration as an `` important step,'' but played down its overall significance. `` As we see it, these drawdowns will affect only the margins of Soviet military power,'' <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> said. `` Even after the anticipated reductions, you will still possess the world's largest active military establishment, as well as a larger inventory of military hardware than all of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> combined in many categories of equipment.'' In a question-and-answer period, a <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> lieutenant general who identified himself only as <PERSON> Krebyshev </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> if the Americans intended to reduce their military forces `` to a defensive level as we are trying now to do.'' <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> reacted with skepticism to the officer's assessment of his own country's military posture. `` I base my judgment on whether policy is offensive or defensive on the total strength and weight of forces that can be brought to bear,'' he said. `` When I'm facing overwhelming numbers, I ca n't conclude anything else but that it's offensively oriented. <PERSON> Moiseyev </PERSON>, seated in front of the lecture hall, objected to <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON>'s assessment. He listed weaponry the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has announced it will withdraw from service, including 10,000 tanks, 8,500 artillery pieces and 850 warplanes. `` This is not a propaganda campaign,'' <PERSON> Moiseyev </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>House Panel Votes to Extend Tax Credits and Simplify Corporate Minimum
Tax</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Over opposition of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, a House Ways and Means subcommittee voted Tuesday to extend expiring tax credits that benefit employers who hire the poor and investors who put money into low-income housing. Also without dissent, the revenue subcommittee agreed to a significant simplification of the corporate minimum tax and voted to expand a credit for rehabilitating historic and other older buildings. The four bills now go to the full Ways and <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, chairman of the subcommittee, said major changes in the bill affecting corporate minimum tax are likely. The four <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> bills would: _ Extend through 1992 the targeted-jobs tax credit, under which the government in effect pays up to $ 2,400 of the first year's wages of newly hired workers from any of nine targeted poor groups Those groups include youths aged 18 through 22, Vietnam-era veterans and welfare recipients. The credit is due to expire at yearend. The administration contends that in many cases, the credit is only a windfall to an employer who would have hired the worker without any special incentive. Renewal would cost $ 647 million over the next five years. _ Modify and extend through 1992 the low-income housing credit, which encourages investors to put mney into building and rehabilitating rental homes for low-income people This would cost more than $ 3.2 billion over the next five years. The subcommittee agreed to permit states, which administer the credit, to carry over for one year any credit authority that was not used in the previous year. Another change would permit claiming the credit in 15-year installments; current law has a 10-year limit. The administration questions whether the credit makes more housing available to families who are substantially under the poverty level. _ Make the tax credit for rehabilitating old buildings more attractive to upper-income investors by watering down a restriction enacted in 1986 in an effort to reduce abusive tax shelters The change would cost $ 145 million over five years. The credit is 10 percent of the cost of rehabilitating any non-residential building constructed before 1936 and 20 percent for certified historical structures. The change would allow an investor at any income level to use a limited amount of passive losses from rental activities to offset non-rental income and still claim the rehabilitation credit. Present law denies that benefit to an investor with total income over $ 250,000. The subcommittee approved a similar change in the low-income housing credit. _ Simplify the corporate minimum tax by eliminating a set of calculations concerning `` adjusted current earnings. The simplification would cost about $ 100 million over five years. This change overrides a provision that was enacted in 1986 but due to go into effect in 1990. Subcommittee members said they will seek to amend the measure to benefit specific industries, including oil and gas, and state and local bonds.

<TEXT>
 Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> endorsed a joint strategy Tuesday to `` heal the wounds'' of European division, which their nations helped inflict half a century ago. They assured the world their partnership poses no threat this time, as it did when <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> and <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> divided <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in their 1939 non-aggression pact. Both nations want `` a common European home in which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> have their place'' and all nations exist in `` peaceful competition with one another,'' the joint declaration says. A tidal wave of goodwill toward <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> on the second day of his state visit appeared to wash away fears rooted in the collusion of the dictators and the destruction of World War II. At least 3,000 people, many waving <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> flags and hand-painted banners with greetings in Russian, welcomed <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON>, in sunny, cobblestoned Market Square. Chants of `` <LOCATION> Gorby </LOCATION>! <LOCATION> Gorby </LOCATION>!'' arose when he ventured into the crowd to shake hands, as he so often does on visits abroad. Soviet <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said the crowd `` made a strong emotional impression'' on <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, and `` he said he felt as if he were on Red Square among his own people.'' On the steps of City Hall, Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> beckoned a flower-waving child. Her husband held up <PERSON> Heinrich-Sebastian </PERSON> <PERSON> Schilling </PERSON>, 4, in front of photographers and a cheering crowd. At a state banquet at <LOCATION> Augustusburg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Castle </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> declared: `` Our cooperation can serve as a catalyst for new relations between the whole of East and West.'' Also on Tuesday, he used a speech at the <LOCATION> Cologne </LOCATION> stock exchange to outline economic reforms intended to encourage joint ventures with West German businesses. He appealed for integration of the economies to make relations `` more quake-resistant.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s four-day visit, which began Monday, has been marked by a clear desire on both sides for a new start in Soviet-German relations and the cooperative pursuit of European unity by historic adversaries. <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, a West German government spokesman, described the joint declaration signed by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> as a turning point in relations. The document states common objectives for improving security and ensuring peace, which both sides see as a second stage in the `` Ostpolitik'' detente begun in 1970. It reiterates the stated aim of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact to work toward a 50 percent reduction in strategic nuclear arms and ban on chemical weapons. Support is expressed for the 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, which the Soviets and West Germans see as prohibiting development of the space-based defense system advocated by former President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. No reference is made to ways of reducing short-range nuclear weapons, a major point of contention in arms control talks between the two military alliances. The first joint East-West approach to overcoming divisions in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> stresses that other nations should not fear renewed cooperation between the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> have embarked on a new course, assuring that better Soviet-West German cooperation ` is not directed against anyone,'' the declaration says. Among the common objectives are the `` right of all peoples and states to freely determine their fate'' and the need `` to heal the wounds of the past,'' it says. Asked whether the agreement could help resolve territorial questions stemming from the <LOCATION> Hitler-Stalin </LOCATION> pact, which allowed the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to annex the independent Baltic states of <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said: `` I do n't think we need to turn to such a distant chapter of history.'' He said the joint agreement's purpose was to formalize the desire of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> for `` a new stage in our relations.'' <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said at a briefing with <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> viewed the joint declaration as the reward of `` a long path of searching over many years.'' Ministers of the two governments made 11 agreements official during the signing ceremony at <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s office, but an accord on access for Soviet shipping to West German canals could not be completed in time. Some of the other agreements establish a <LOCATION> Bonn-Moscow </LOCATION> `` hot line'' and deal with protection of capital investments, training of Soviet managers in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and cultural and student exchanges.

<HEAD>Hitler Yacht Sunk in Wrong Spot, Must Be Moved</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A yacht built for <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> and sunk with great fanfare to commemorate the `` Voyage of the Damned'' was mistakenly dropped on a delicate coral reef in a shallow shipping lane, officials said Tuesday. `` They're going to have to move it,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Veronica </PERSON> <PERSON> Cady </PERSON>. The 85-foot Ostwind yacht was supposed to become an artificial reef in 250 feet of water about two miles off the coast. It was sunk June 4, 50 years after the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> turned away the SS <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> as its more than 900 Jewish passengers were seeking refuge from the Holocaust. The sinking site was supposed to be near where the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> intercepted the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, whose passengers also were turned away by <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and forced to return to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Most of the passengers later died in Nazi concentration camps. For unexplained reasons, the <PERSON> Ostwind </PERSON> was pushed off a barge about a mile north of the site, and is resting in 25 feet of water on a living reef. `` It was truly an incredible, incredible historic event, and suddenly _ boom! _ somebody made a mistake,'' said Mayor <PERSON> Abe </PERSON> <PERSON> Resnick </PERSON>, a Holocaust survivor and a sponsor of the event. Federal and <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> officials who allowed <PERSON> Resnick </PERSON> to sink the boat are upset about the result. `` They did n't even come close,'' complained <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Markely </PERSON>, an administrator with <PERSON> Dade </PERSON>'s environmental department. Coast Guard Lt. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Crespo </PERSON> said the yacht is balanced on a delicate living reef, threatening damage to coral and sponges. It's also close to an anchoring spot for freighters and other vessels heading to the port of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and has been marked with a flashing buoy, he said `` It's close enough that if a ship swings on its anchor, it could hit it,'' <PERSON> Crespo </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> said the Ostwind must be moved or cut to pieces by June 22. If it's not, the government will remove it and <PERSON> bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Resnick </PERSON>. <PERSON> Resnick </PERSON> blames the mistake on A.M. <PERSON> Daly </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, captain of the tug that towed the yacht to where it was sunk. <PERSON> Daly </PERSON>, however, said <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Cadley </PERSON>, captain of a passenger boat that accompanied him, had agreed to lead him to the site. <PERSON> Cadley </PERSON> denied that, saying he only agreed to meet <PERSON> Daly </PERSON> off the coast. <PERSON> Resnick </PERSON> said someone will have to pay. `` I think's that's going to end up being decided by attorneys,'' said <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Mostkoff </PERSON>, the county's artificial reef director. The Ostwind was built at <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s direction, although he rarely used it. After World War II, the badly decayed boat wound up in the hands of a <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> marina owner.

 A gunman, branded by the mayor as the `` arch-typical vigilante,'' is being sought by authorities for allegedly shooting at six young people in a subway station in revenge for them robbing him a day earlier. The gunman confronted the six youths Saturday and asked `` Remember me?'' before opening fire with a 9mm gun, police said. The gunman, described as about 17, then fled the station and disappeared, police said. Robbery charges against three of the youths caught in the gunfire were temporarily dropped Monday by the <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> district attorney's office while detectives searched for the victim-turned-gunman `` We need the victim to corroborate the robbery,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Haber </PERSON>. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Innis </PERSON>, national chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Racial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equality </ORGANIZATION>, likened the gunman to <PERSON> Bernhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON>, the `` subway gunman'' who wounded four teen-agers on a subway train in 1985 because he said they had threatened him. <PERSON> Innnis </PERSON> appealed to the gunman to surrender and offered him free legal counsel. `` Your assailants should not be allowed to walk arrogantly free while you are forced to hide,'' <PERSON> Innis </PERSON> said in a statement. But Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> dismissed any comparison between the gunman and <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON>. `` A jury found that <PERSON> Bernie </PERSON> <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> was in danger, in his mind, reasonable, under the circumstances, for him to take an action to defend himself,'' he said. `` In this case, this guy was not in any danger. He had been held up on a prior occasion, recognized the people, apparently, who allegedly held him up, and went over to inflict personal punishment.'' `` That's arch-typical vigilantism _ unacceptable,'' <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> declared. Detectives canvassed the area of Friday's robbery and Saturday' assaults in an effort to find witnesses <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> District Attorney <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Holtzman </PERSON>'s office decided Monday to defer prosecution against <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Godbole </PERSON>, 24, <PERSON> Dantay </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 16, and a 14-year-old youth whose name was withheld because of his age, until the victim of the robbery is found. Godbole and <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> were wounded in the thigh and the teen-ager was wounded in the buttocks. They were arrested based on statements from the other three youths who were present both nights, said <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Leary </PERSON>. They were charged with first-degree robbery and possession of a weapon, a hammer, which was allegedly used Friday by the group that surrounded the man believed to be the gunman and stole his gold chain and gold bracelet. The gunman faces charges of attempted murder and criminal use of a deadly weapon, police said.

 The nation's beleaguered savings institutions lost $ 3.4 billion in the first three months of this year, in sharp contrast with commercial banks which enjoyed record profits of $ 7.3 billion, the government reported Tuesday. As in the past, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls, suffering from a depressed regional economy, contributed the bulk of the savings industry's losses. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> thrifts lost $ 2.2 billion, although that was a 38 percent improvement over the same period in 1988. Seventy-three percent of <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls nationally earned a profit _ $ 1.3 billion. But that was swamped by $ 4.7 billion in losses at the 27 percent that lost money. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> reported that losses by the 2,938 <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls worsened from the revised $ 3.2 billion in the final three months of 1988. Meanwhile, profits at the 13,001 commercial banks hit a record level for the third straight quarter, up from $ 6.7 billion in the final three months of last year. The bank board revised its previously reported <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L loss total for all of last year, adding $ 900 million to bring 1988 red ink to a post-Depression record of $ 13 billion. `` The thrift industry will be plagued by continuing losses,'' predicted economist <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Getman </PERSON> of The <ORGANIZATION> WEFA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a <PERSON> Bala </PERSON> <PERSON> Cynwyd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, consulting firm. `` Not only are property values in some areas still falling, but thrifts have been squeezed -LRB- because -RRB- their cost of funds have been rising faster than their mortgage rates.'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Barth </PERSON>, chief economist of the bank board, said heavy S & amp; L losses would continue until <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> enacts President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s bailout bill. `` No legislation, no new funds, is not the best way to deal with open but insolvent institutions,'' he said. <PERSON> Barth </PERSON> said the more than 200 institutions rescued last year with government assistance contributed $ 145 million in profits, but, he said, about 10 of those institutions were losing money. Reporting on commercial banks, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said profits rose in 42 states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> and declined in eight states and <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, in particular, looked weaker, with profits slipping in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheshunoff </PERSON>, a financial industry analyst based in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, said he was concerned that banks have increased their real estate lending by 12.9 percent over a year ago while boosting commercial lending by only 1.4 percent. `` Real estate lending has been the Achilles' heel of the banking industry. We're beginning to see that deteriorate in the Northeast,'' he said. Only one state, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, reported a loss for its banks. But its $ 13 million in red ink was minuscule compared with a $ 1.7 billion net loss in the comparable 1988 quarter. Other oil-producing states _ <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> _ also showed big improvements. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> analyst, attributed commercial banking's strong performance to a decline in bad loans, particularly in states west of the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, an increase in loan income caused by rising interest rates, and success in controlling overhead expenses Unlike S & amp; Ls, banks offer mostly short-term loans and can more quickly raise the interest rate they charge while at the same time holding down rates paid to depositors. Compared with S & amp; Ls, banks are hurt less, and sometimes helped, by rising interest rates. <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> said bad loans have declined particularly in farming states and noted that institutions there so far have not suffered because of last year's drought. Despite the profits, banks continued to fail at a high rate. The <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION>, which insures deposits, said 93 banks have failed or required government assistance so far this year, compared with 89 during the same period in 1988. For all of last year, a post-Depression record of 221 failed. However, the number of `` problem banks'' has slipped to 1,289, the lowest level in three years, down from 1,491 a year ago. Despite the failures last year, banks posted a record profit of $ 25.1 billion. That followed a post-Depression low in 1987 of $ 2.8 billion, which was caused by large write-offs of Third World debt. <PERSON> Getman </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s problems in making payments on its $ 60 billion in debt will likely begin hurting bank performance in the second and third quarters. `` Obviously bank profits are very good, but they're not likely to stay that good this year,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 President-elect <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> changed his mind and said Tuesday he will take office June 30, the date <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> intends to resign because of the worst economic crisis in Argentine history. `` We are willing, totally willing, to assume the direction of the Argentine republic on that date,'' <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rioja </LOCATION> province, of which he is governor. On Monday night, <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> said in a nationally broadcast speech he lacked the political support to manage the crisis and said he would leave office at the end of the month. From <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rioja </LOCATION>, 700 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> expressed surprise at the statement and said he could not assume the presidency on such short notice. <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>'s change of heart Tuesday appeared to resolve an impasse that began when his <ORGANIZATION> Peronist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> defeated <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Radical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> in national elections May 14, seven months before the Dec. 10 inauguration date stipulated in the constitution. The constitution requires four months between election and inauguration of a president so a formal electoral college vote can be taken, but <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> called the elections early because of the economic crisis. The charter limits a president to one six-year term. For half a day after <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>'s speech, it appeared <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, would be interim chief executive At a news conference Tuesday, surrounded by his <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> designees, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> said: `` We are prepared to assume this responsability on the date the president has decided. That is to say, on June 30 we will begin to govern <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>.'' The Peronists and <ORGANIZATION> Radical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> tried for weeks to reach an accord on an early transition, against a backdrop of inflation that nearly doubled prices every month, a growing budget deficit, a nearly worthless currency, record interest rates and rising unemployment. At least 14 people were killed and dozens seriously injured in food riots and looting that began the last week of May. Some in <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>'s party said the main obstacle was <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>'s insistence that <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> end the divisive trials of about 18 officers accused of violating human rights in the `` dirty war'' against leftists by the military governments of 1976-83 <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> refused to intervene in those cases or to grant amnesty to officers already tried, convicted and sentenced to prison. Army officers demanding the trials be stopped led three rebellions between April 1987 and December 1988. In a draft agreement <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> signed and sent to <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> on Monday, he said Radicals in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would support <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>'s economic and social legislation. <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> said Tuesday he needs those votes and asked for `` an explicit commitment before the Argentine people that the package of laws that will be sent to the national <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are going to be respected, approved and sanctioned.'' He did not mention the military question.

 <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and leaders of the opposition began negotiations Tuesday on multiparty elections that could lead to the nation's first coalition government in more than 40 years. Parliament Speaker <PERSON> Matyas </PERSON> <PERSON> Szueros </PERSON>, who presided over the 45-minute meeting in parliament's ornate Hunter Hall, said the unprecedented meeting marked `` the end of an era and the opening of a new one.'' Hungarians are `` anxious and hopeful,'' <PERSON> Szueros </PERSON> told the delegates. `` The people expect to draw encouragement from your talks.'' The party, seven groups largely associated with it and nine opposition groups are negotiating to determine the rules for the first multiparty parliamentary elections since the communists consolidated power in 1948. The elections are due by the middle of next year, but there have been increasing calls for them to be held sooner. <PERSON> Szueros </PERSON> said the negotiating parties will meet again on June 21 to agree on the main themes they will address. Party chief <PERSON> Karoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> told the participants he hoped for `` a viable governing coalition after the elections, and in view of this we need to emphasize the things that unite us.'' `` Let us work together for a new <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> said. He said all of the participants want to accelerate the transition to a more democractic government. Speaking on behalf of the opposition, <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Konya </PERSON> said: `` We do not want to share in power. We want the citizens to decide whom they want to entrust'' with leading <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. `` Everyone must renounce the use of force, even if the elections do not turn out to their liking,'' added <LOCATION> Konya </LOCATION>, a lawyer. <PERSON> Istvan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kukorelli </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Patriotic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> spoke on behalf of the groups largely associated with the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, and said they were `` tolerant of different views.'' The groups, including the party's youth league and official trade unions, do not consider themselves a unified body, he said, and `` do not wish to operate under the tutelage of any party.'' The three factions formally agreed to the election negotiations on Saturday. Opposition groups established in the past year and a half have been pressing for a say in drafting legislation and a new constitution for free elections and the transition to a more democratic government. The party approached the opposition groups about the issues in March. Those groups said they would participate in any negotiations as a united front. On June 4, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> held multiparty elections _ the most democratic in the Soviet bloc in four decades _ and opposition candidates backed by Solidarity won nearly every seat open to them.

<HEAD>Trade Deficit Widens Sharply</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The deficit in the broadest measure of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade widened sharply in the first three months of the year as an improvement in the sale of American merchandise was swamped by a deterioration in the country's investment balance sheet, the government reported Tuesday. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the deficit in the current account, which had fallen for two consecutive quarters, jumped 7 percent. Analysts viewed the setback as disturbing evidence of how severe <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s trading problems are. Meanwhile, the government also reported Tuesday that retail sales, held back by weak auto and department store sales, rose a slim 0.1 percent in May. The current account, also known as the balance of payments, is the most important trade statistic because it measures not only trade in merchandise but also transactions in services, primarily investment flows between countries. For the first three months of the year, the merchandise portion of the deficit showed a marked improvement, narrowing by 13.7 percent to $ 27.63 billion, the smallest deficit for merchandise trade in four years. That improvement was offset, however, by a steep drop in the services category, which fell to a tiny surplus of $ 369 million from a surplus of $ 8.36 billion in the fourth quarter of 1988. Most of the first quarter decline was blamed on the rising value of the dollar, which lowers the profits of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies operating overseas because their foreign earnings buy less when they are changed back into dollars. Beyond the currency movements, analysts said the trade report was disturbing because it reflected the fact that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, once the world's largest creditor nation, is now its largest debtor. Simply put, that means foreigners now own more in investments in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> than Americans hold in overseas investments. The total excess of foreign holdings is estimated to have risen above $ 500 billion last year although the government's official accounting of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> net debtor status will not be released until June 29. Many economists believe <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s standard of living will deteriorate in coming years as the country is forced to transfer more and more of its wealth into foreign hands to service its foreign debt. `` The current account reflects how much we have to continue to borrow,'' said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` Here we are doing so much better on our merchandise exports, but we are still hurting because of our increasing debtor status.'' <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Latta </PERSON>, senior economist at <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said she believed a decline in living standards could already be seen in the weak growth over the last few years in personal incomes after adjusting for inflation. `` We are already starting to feel the effects of the consumption binge the country has been on,'' she said. `` At some point we have to slow our consumption'' by saving more and thus lessening the need to import foreign capital. The current account provides a measure of the amount of money this country must raise abroad to finance its economy. At the start of this decade, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was running surpluses in its current account because earnings from American investments abroad were enough to offset perennial deficits in merchandise trade. But as Americans transferred billions of dollars into foreign hands to pay for imported cars and televisions, the investment cushion shrank rapidly and disappeared altogether in 1985, when <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> became a net debtor for the first time in 71 years. The changed status has stired a political debate over whether growing foreign ownership of American companies, real estate and <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds means that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is transfering control of its economic destiny to foreigners. Tuesday's report said that in addition to the $ 27.63 billion deficit in merchandise trade and the slight $ 369 million surplus in the services category, the $ 30.69 billion current account deficit reflected payments of $ 3.42 billion in foreign aid and pensions to Americans living overseas. The government is due to release on Thursday its estimate of the merchandise trade deficit for April. In advance of that report, many analysts were looking for little change from the March monthly deficit figure of $ 8.86 billion. In the report on retail sales, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the tiny 0.1 percent increase put May sales at a seasonally adjusted $ 141.1 billion. Analysts said they expected this sluggishness to continue as consumers' saw their purchasing power constrained by higher energy and food costs.

<HEAD>Trade Cases Likely If Steel Import Program Ends, Panel Told</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Allowing steel import barriers to lapse this year would leave <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> firms little alternative but to file costly unfair trading cases against some steel-exporting nations, proponents of the restraints told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel Tuesday. A hearing by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> trade subcommittee pitted advocates of the import curbs against the policy's opponents, who argued that the steel industry has had too much special protection. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration negotiated five-year, product-by-product `` voluntary restraint agreements'' in 1984 with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and other nations to limit the flow of foreign steel into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The agreements expire Sept. 30, and President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has pledged to continue the curbs in some form. But with the domestic steel industry newly profitable, opponents of the program believe they can make a case for ending the barriers, or at least narrowing their scope. House backers of the curbs said Wednesday they have 240 co-sponsors for a bill implementing the program. They are hoping that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will soon begin negotiating new steel import pacts with the 29 nations covered by the old agreements. But not all the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members at the hearing agreed that the pacts should be renewed. Republican leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> called for a gradual phase-out of the import program, and Rep. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., said steelworkers' salaries have been above the average manufacturing wage since World War II `` Why should we treat the steel industry any differently from all the other industries?'' said <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON>, the trade subcommittee chairman. But <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steelworkers </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> told the panel that the alternative to negotiated agreements would be unfair trading cases filed by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> firms. `` Most of our trading partners have entered into these negotiations primarily because, absent negotiated settlements, other trade restraint options could have been applied against them since they were vulnerable to being declared as unfair traders,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said in a prepared statement. `` In other words, it is not unlike an out-of-court settlement where the evidence of violation, at least in the steel import situation, was so overwhelming that the offending party preferred settlement to adjudication,'' he said. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Luerssen </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, an industry group, agreed that the alternative to restraint agreements would be `` massive and very costly trade litigation.'' But <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON> said the negotiated settlements have done little to discourage foreign governments from subsidizing their steel industries, making it tough for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> firms to compete. `` I want to use the laws on the books to whack them in the head, whack them in the knees and wherever else they need it,'' he said.

<HEAD>MiG-29 Pilot Says Bird May Have Caused Crash of Jet Fighter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SYDNEY RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Soviet pilot said Tuesday he battled to keep his MiG-29 from crashing into a crowd at the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> Air Show last week after a bird or other foreign object got caught in the fighter jet's engine <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Kvochur </PERSON>, who saved himself by ejecting from the aircraft about 500 feet before it crashed Thursday, said he took about three seconds to decide where to aim his falling jet. The 37-year-old pilot, who suffered only minor injuries, spoke at a news conference inside a huge Antonov-225 transport plane. About 2 minutes and 50 seconds after takeoff, <PERSON> Kvochur </PERSON> said he pushed the throttle to increase thrust, and at that moment the right engine stalled. He said the MiG-29 is equipped with a special system to deal with such a situation and he believed the engine would recover. `` I was greatly concerned that the aircraft did not turn to the crowd of people, buildings and aircraft,'' said <PERSON> Kvochur </PERSON>, who has 12 years of flying experience. The aircraft began pulling toward the crowd along the airstrip, he said, and he expected the engine to recover. `` I expected to save the aircraft,'' he said. He said he then realized the engines would not recover and a crash was inevitable, and steered the aircraft to an open space on the airfield. `` You see,'' he said speaking in Russian through an interpreter, `` I had time to spare to think of the situation, but very few seconds to do it. `` It was a hard decision to eject ... it is hard to leave an aircraft that's still flying.'' <PERSON> Kvochur </PERSON> thanked the French emergency personnel and doctors who `` treated me with special care.'' He also thanked <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, director of flight operations for the 10-day air show, for making him fly higher than the usual 450 feet at which he flies the same routine in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kvochur </PERSON> said he suffered only minor bruises to his back and stomach, and a slight cut on his eyebrow when his oxygen mask struck his face when he hit the ground. `` I feel quite good ... and if my bosses will allow me, I'd like to fly the MiG-29 from <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, and if they really trust me I'd like to fly another MiG-29 during the show,'' he said with a grin. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, who also attended the news conference, said the pilot `` performed exactly the way I'm supposed to see everyone perform.'' `` He was on the dot, he made no mistakes,'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Rostislav </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Belyakov </PERSON>, general designer for the <ORGANIZATION> Mikoyan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Design </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studio </ORGANIZATION> that crafted the MiG-29, complimented <PERSON> Kvochur </PERSON>'s performance, calling him `` the most famous pilot of the day.'' <PERSON> Balyakov </PERSON> defended the reliability of the MiG-29 which he said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> intends to market aggressively to clients in the future. `` We have the production facilities to sell the aircraft for export and we expect to do it,'' he said, adding that it would be marketed at a price comparable to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fighters. Although an official report has not yet been issued <PERSON> Kvochur </PERSON> said he believed a foreign object, possibly a bird or a small stone from the airstrip, was sucked into the right engine as it prepared for takeoff. The two flight recorders were sent to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> right after the crash and <PERSON> Belyakov </PERSON> said they corroborate <PERSON> Kvochur </PERSON>'s analysis of the incident. <PERSON> Belyakov </PERSON> added that videotapes showed a bird near the aircraft. `` There is nothing that can be done to stop a bird flying into the engine ... and if there was one bird there could have been two or a whole squadron,'' he said.

 Syrian and Christian soldiers exchanged fire for five hours Tuesday in an artillery war that has killed hundreds of people in the past three months, most of them civilians. An Arab League envoy met with <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> leaders about ways of stopping the battle. The league proclaimed a cease-fire in April, but it has been violated regularly. Police said nine people were wounded Tuesday by shelling with howitzers, tank cannons and recoilless rifles along the southeastern flank of the 310-square-mile enclave east of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> where 1 million Christians live. At least 367 people have been slain and 1,441 wounded since the fighting began March 8 between <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> units led by Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> and a Moslem alliance of Syrian soldiers and Druse militiamen. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> has 40,000 soldiers in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> under an <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping mandate issued in 1976, the year after <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s sectarian civil war began <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> has declared a `` war of liberation'' against what he describes as Syrian occupation. A spokesman for <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s command accused Syrian gunners of provoking Monday's duel by shelling Christian positions around <LOCATION> Souk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> el-Gharb </LOCATION>, a mountain resort southeast of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Souk el-Gharb commands roads that connect the Christian enclave and mountains controlled by the Syrians and Druse. The spokesman for <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, who would not let his name be used, said Syrian gunners also shelled <LOCATION> Kfarshima </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Hadath </PERSON>, <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> suburbs of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Christian gunners `` responded in kind to the enemy fire,'' according to the spokesman. He said the shells came from <LOCATION> Aitat </LOCATION>, a Syrian-controlled Druse village south of <LOCATION> Souk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> el-Gharb </LOCATION>, and from <LOCATION> Choueifat </LOCATION>, a Druse suburb of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. `` The Syrian shelling targeted several residential areas,'' the spokesman said. `` The four civilians were wounded in <PERSON> Hadath </PERSON>.'' He accused the yrians of starting the fight to `` foil efforts by <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> leaders to work out a solid cease-fire.'' <PERSON> Lakhdar </PERSON> <PERSON> Ibrahimi </PERSON>, assistant secretary-general of the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, met with <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> leaders in the enclave during the artillery exchange. It began as he drove across the line from Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> to the Christian eastern sector for separate meetings with <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> Patriarch <PERSON> Nasrallah </PERSON> <PERSON> Sfeir </PERSON>, former President <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Helou </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Saadeh </PERSON>, leader of the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Phalange </ORGANIZATION> party. <PERSON> Ibrahimi </PERSON> met <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> at the general's combination bunker and office beneath the heavily damaged presidential palace in <LOCATION> Baabda </LOCATION>, east of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. After conferring with the Maronite general, <PERSON> Ibrahimi </PERSON> told reporters a three-member <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> summit committee was `` determined to achieve its mandate on <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The contacts I'm holding are within this framework.'' The committee _ King Fahd of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> II of <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Chadli </PERSON> <PERSON> Bendjedid </PERSON>, president of <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> _ was appointed by the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> summit in <LOCATION> Casablanca </LOCATION> last month to find a settlement of the Lebanese civil war. Last weekend, <PERSON> Ibrahimi </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> for talks with President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, who has become <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s main power broker, and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Farouk </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharaa </PERSON>. The latest round in the civil war began two days after <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s men blockaded illegal ports run by Moslem militias, which deprive the government of an estimated $ 100 million a year in customs revenues. Druse militiamen led by <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON> began the shooting. The Syrians soon joined them and Moslem forces sealed off the Christian enclave.

 <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, on the verge of marking one year atop the <ORGANIZATION> A.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> ratings, barely hung onto first place last week with competition from two <ORGANIZATION> NBA </ORGANIZATION> playoff games on CBS. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> was also affected by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s prime-time news conference, because it pre-empted part of the network's high-rated Thursday lineup. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> won the week ending June 11 with an average prime-time rating of 11.1. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> had 10.8 and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> 9.6. It was <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s 51st win in a row. The last time <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> was out of first place was last June, when <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> had two games of the <ORGANIZATION> NBA </ORGANIZATION> playoffs, also between the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lakers </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pistons </ORGANIZATION>. The series so far has rated slightly higher than last year's. Tuesday's game ranked 16th in the Nielsens. Thursday's was tied for ninth. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> won on the strength of its regular series, even though they were in repeats. But <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Roseanne'' continued to top the summer rankings. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` The Cosby Show'' dropped to 11th place, which <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> attributed to the schedule shift for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s news conference. The rest of the top 10, all repeats except for the <ORGANIZATION> NBA </ORGANIZATION> game, were: `` Cheers,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>; `` A Place to Call Home,'' CBS; `` Empty Nest,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>; `` Golden Girls,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>; `` Dear <PERSON> John </PERSON>,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>; `` Wonder Years,'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>; `` Murder, She Wrote,'' <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, tied with the playoff game; and `` Day by Day,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, in a special Thursday showing. The three-network share was only 58, typical of last summer. But big interest in news events, particularly <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, apparently contributed to a 14 percent rise in viewership for the networks' evening newscasts, compared to the previous week The `` CBS Evening News'' had a 9.8 rating and 21 share, barely edging the 9.7 and 21 for `` ABC World News Tonight.'' `` NBC Nightly News'' had a 9.0 and 18. Each rating point equals 904,000 households with television. The share is a percentage of sets in use. <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> got its highest share ever out of `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Most Wanted'' last week, an 18. It also made some inroads on Monday night with the second of its monthly theatrical movies. This one, `` Big Trouble in <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>,'' got a 14 share. The lowest-rated network shows of the week were: `` Live In,'' `` North & amp; <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, Book II, Part 5,'' `` ABC Thursday Night Baseball,'' `` Beauty & amp; the <LOCATION> Beast </LOCATION>,'' `` Mission Impossible,'' `` Tour of Duty,'' `` Flamingo Kid,'' `` <PERSON> Davy </PERSON> <PERSON> Crockett </PERSON>,'' `` Seaworld: Miracle Babies'' and `` Hard Time on Planet Earth.''

Postal Service drop box Saturday at the front entrance to the <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> branch in <LOCATION> Shorewood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, police in this Madison suburb said Monday. Thieves dropped off the 200-pound mailbox at the bank after it closed Saturday and removed it that night or Sunday morning, Detective <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuschel </PERSON> said. He said more than one robber and a truck or van was probably needed to handle the mailbox.

 Two videos that include graphic re-enactments of racial incidents will be shown to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> schoolchildren this fall as part of a civil rights education program that police hope will become a national model. Two 20-minute videos, one for elementary school students and the other for teen-agers, were screened Monday night for city officials, religious leaders, community organizers and some students. Many in the audience gasped at the stark depictions of racism and discrimination, some of which were drawn from real-life cases, according to police. They will be shown to students in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> public and parochial schools in all grades, including kindergarten, this fall. The videos included re-enactments of an incident involving a white man beating a Vietnamese youth on the street and two black teen-agers punching a white youth as he stood at a bus stop. The video designed for younger children included a sketch involving professional actors and a group of kids who ostracized all 8-year-olds by chanting `` Down with Eights.'' Among those authorities especially hope to inform are inner-city children and newly arrived immigrants who learn about the American system through their children. `` For the first time, we will have a program that will teach the adults of the future that they have the right to dignity _ without being harassed, intimidated or insulted,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roache </PERSON>. `` There's a law backing you up.'' <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> is one of 14 states that has a civil rights statute, according to police. It was enacted in 1979, and is one of the toughest civil rights laws in the country, carrying with it a mandatory 10-year sentence for those convicted of criminal violation of a person's civil rights. The 11-year-old Community Disorders Unit, the first police unit in the country formed to investigate racially motivated crimes, commissioned the videos. They were produced in conjunction with the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith and <ORGANIZATION> WCVB-TV </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. `` No one in 1989 should be made to suffer in silence,'' said <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Zakim </PERSON>, of the Anti-Defamation League. `` We're doing more than saying its a terrible thing. We're doing something about it.'' <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> police say that members of the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> police department have already visited the city to learn about the videos and civil rights education here. They said they hoped the message contained in the videos will spread around the country and inspire civil rights education in other cities.

 Police in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> detained a crew from ABC News as it tried to photograph a family watching <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s evening TV news, a correspondent for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> network said Tuesday. `` It was like a scene from a bad Gestapo movie,'' said ABC News correspondent <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Litke </PERSON>. He said two uniformed police and three plainclothesmen burst in on the crew without warning Monday night. `` They swept aside a curtain and were confronted by us with our camera, two big lights, a mike man with a boom,'' <PERSON> Litke </PERSON> said. `` They looked very surprised.'' The three-member crew and its government-assigned interpreter were held for about 2 -LCB- hours, <PERSON> Litke </PERSON> said, adding that the Chinese family was not arrested and no videotape was confiscated. More than 50 foreign journalists are in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s largest city, covering events in the aftermath of the June 3-4 shootings of pro-democracy protesters in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. The largest demonstration in the country since the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> crackdown drew 50,000 people in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> on Friday, but with the highly publicized arrests of labor leaders and some students over the weekend, protesters have disappeared from <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>'s streets. <PERSON> Litke </PERSON> said police who detained the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> crew `` were very cordial, but they would not let us leave. The family looked a mixture of nervous, frightened and sad.'' The police took away the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> interpreter for about two hours and told him that `` we were all on tourist visas and breaking the rules, and if we wanted to work we must get permission from <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Litke </PERSON>, who is based in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. `` They told him if we continued working here then we would be going down a ` dangerous path,''' <PERSON> Litke </PERSON> said. `` They never ordered us out, but when our translator suggested we might leave today, they said that would be a very good idea.'' He said he would leave for <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> later Tuesday. On Saturday, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> TV </ORGANIZATION> journalist <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Newport </PERSON> was expelled from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION>, of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, was detained as he photographed a protest by about 200 students in front of <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> police headquarters. <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION> has been the only foreign journalist expelled during the current crisis in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, although reporters have been warned in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> that they can not engage in news gathering without explicit permission from central or local authorities. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> were prepared to protest the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> incident, but did not because the Americans were not arrested or expelled, said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>, a spokesman at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consulate </ORGANIZATION>. The Chinese `` are obviously watching very closely,'' <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> said, with several journalists reporting being followed. Only about 100 Americans remain in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> and in the neighboring provinces of <LOCATION> Jiangsu </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zhejiang </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Anhui </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> said. `` We're still advising Americans to leave. We do n't think its advisable to stay in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> said. Also on Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consulate </ORGANIZATION> said it has not received word from <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> officials concerning <PERSON> Yao </PERSON> <PERSON> Yongzhan </PERSON>, a student from <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Yao </PERSON> was with British students and two officials from the British Consulate when he was detained Sunday on grounds he had not registered with security authorities and was in possession of what the Chinese press called `` contraband materials.'' British Consul <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> had not been able to meet with officials of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> to discuss <PERSON> Yao </PERSON>'s case, said Vice Consul <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Cormack </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said it had told <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s top diplomat in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Yao </PERSON> `` should be immediately returned to <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. Any maltreatment by the Chinese authorities of the <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> Chinese would have the most damaging impact in confidence in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, a British colony, is to revert to Chinese rule in 1997.

 Rep. <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee, said Tuesday there was no connection between the panel's hiring of the president of the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> airport commission in 1986 and a lucrative investment by <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>'s wife in shops at the airport <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> said <PERSON> Johnnie </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> attorney, was paid $ 170,000 in 1986 and 1987 for legal work for the ethics committee. `` I did hire <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON> to do work on the <ORGANIZATION> St </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Germain </ORGANIZATION> case,'' <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Calif., said in a telephone interview The ethics committee looked into the personal finances of Rep. <PERSON> Fernand </PERSON> <PERSON> St </PERSON> <PERSON> Germain </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, and concluded in 1987 that any improprieties did not warrant further investigation. <PERSON> St </PERSON> <PERSON> Germain </PERSON> was defeated in his 1988 re-election bid. Two months after the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee retained <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON> on Feb. 5, 1986, the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commissioners </ORGANIZATION> awarded a concession to run seven duty-free stores at the airport to a joint venture headed by <ORGANIZATION> Duty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shoppers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. At that time _ April 1986 _ <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON> was president of the airport board. He is no longer president, but remains on the five-member board. Other companies in the joint venture were <ORGANIZATION> Mir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a minority enterprise, and <ORGANIZATION> Peideau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a female-run business. City policies required that minority and female-run businesses be part of any concession handed out by the airport. In July 1986, <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Betty </PERSON>, bought a 12 percent interest in Mir Kanon and <LOCATION> Peideau </LOCATION>. This investment earned her over $ 150,000 in 1987 and 1988, according to <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>'s financial disclosure forms for those years. `` There was no connection ... I want to make this as strong as I can ... no connection between the hiring -LRB- of <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON> -RRB- and Mrs. <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>'s business,'' <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> said. `` I have never discussed with <PERSON> Johnnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON> anything about <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>'s business.'' <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON> said he did n't know Mrs. <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> was part of the duty free concession until about a year ago. `` At no time did <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> and I ever talk about it'' until recent weeks, said <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON>. <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON> said he voted to give Duty Free Shoppers the concession on April 30, 1986, but he was not part of the committee that recommended the firm. <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> recently gained national exposure when he presided over the ethics committee's investigation of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, who resigned after the panel charged him with 69 violations of House rules. Among other things, the committee said <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Betty </PERSON>, accepted improper gifts from a wealthy <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> businessman, allegations <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> denied. Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., who succeeded <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> as the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> speaker, said he knew of nothing amiss about Mrs. <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>'s business or her husband's decision to amend his 1986 financial disclosure form `` As far as I know, there is no impropriety of any kind, and the refiling is in accordance with the rules,'' he said. <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> said <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON>, an `` outstanding lawyer,'' was hired by the ethics panel `` based on his qualifications and the qualifications of his law firm.'' Meantime, airport officials are examining the contract with Duty Free Shoppers and the two other firms to make sure they are legal and meet the intent of the city's minority contracting policy. Duty Free Shoppers said <PERSON> Mir </PERSON> <PERSON> Kanon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Peideau </PERSON> make up 32 percent of the concession for the seven duty-free shops, and 18 percent of the concession for the 18 gift and news shops at the international airport, the third-busiest in the world. <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> revealed Monday that his wife paid between $ 5,000 and $ 15,000 for her investment in the two companies in 1986. He filed an amended financial disclosure statement in response to questions from The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. In his earlier 1986 financial disclosure form, <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> said the investment was worth between $ 100,000 and $ 250,000 at the end of 1986, meaning the value of the shares soared in a six-month period.

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should pursue a new claim that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> servicemen are being held prisoner in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and seek their release, a former congressman said Tuesday. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendon </PERSON>, chairman of the POW Publicity Fund based in <LOCATION> McLean </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, was in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to speak with the daughter of a Japanese man who says he shared a prison cell with Americans in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Iwanobu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yoshida </PERSON> was freed in January after 14 years in captivity. `` This latest report represents a window of opportunity for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to try to gain the release of those prisoners of war still alive inside <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Hendon </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s embassy in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> denied reports that it still holds American POWs, calling <PERSON> Yoshida </PERSON>'s story `` an absolute lie.'' <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has said repeatedly it does not hold any American prisoners from the Vietnam War. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> lists 2,364 people missing in action from the war. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Olsson </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> would study information collected by an American military attache who met with <PERSON> Yoshida </PERSON> on Sunday. <PERSON> Yoshida </PERSON>, 65, is hospitalized in his hometown of <LOCATION> Sapporo </LOCATION> on the northernmost Japanese island of Hokkaido, 520 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. The hospital says he suffers from mental disorders and a speech impediment. <PERSON> Hendon </PERSON> met <PERSON> Yoshida </PERSON>'s daughter, <PERSON> Keiko </PERSON> <PERSON> Takatsuka </PERSON>, on Monday but was unable to see <PERSON> Yoshida </PERSON>, who has refused to see other visitors since meeting with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official. <PERSON> Yoshida </PERSON> has said he shared a cell with three Americans and saw others while in Vietnamese prisons. After becoming a <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monk in 1966, <PERSON> Yoshida </PERSON> left his family and emigrated to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, where he set up a temple in <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION>, now <LOCATION> Ho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Minh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. He became a South Vietnamese citizen in 1973. <PERSON> Yoshida </PERSON> was arrested in 1975 after communist forces took over <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>.

 Fire swept through a home in a small farming community, killing seven people, including four children, authorities said Tuesday. <LOCATION> Monterey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff's Sergeant <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said a call Monday night alerted police and fire officials, but by the time they arrived the home, a converted candy factory, was fully engulfed in flames. Volunteer Fire Chief <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Banuelos </PERSON> said witnesses reported a muffled explosion was heard shortly before the fire erupted, but there was no immeidate word on what might have caused it. The <LOCATION> Monterey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> fire and arson investigation team was called. The coroner's office said a 30-year-old man and two women, 23 and 20, were found in the charred ruins, along with the children. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said the seventh victim, an 8-year-old girl, escaped the home but died later at a hospital. A 9-year-old boy survived after being pulled from the flames. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said the boy told investigators he was awakened by his mother, who said the kitchen was on fire and to get out of the house. An uncle, <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, identified the boy as <PERSON> Freddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Pacheco </PERSON>.

 The installation of vapor recovery nozzles at thousands of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> gasoline pumps has made `` a major contribution to clearer air,'' and motorists' early complaints have vanished, state officials say. `` We did have complaints at the beginning, largely because the nozzles were so different from the hoses people were accustomed to ... and they were bulky and heavy,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Sessa </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. `` Unfortunately, this program began at about the same time most stations were converting to self-service, so that compounded the problem. The first hoses were designed for attendant use,'' <PERSON> Sessa </PERSON> added. But now, he said, `` I ca n't remember when I heard the last consumer complaint. Our program seems to have been accepted by the driving public.'' Although there are still bulky double-hose vapor recovery systems at many <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> stations, most now are equipped with light-weight hoses which look and feel to the motorists like the pre-regulation hoses. The nozzles are designed to capture air pollution-causing hydrocarbons that evaporate from gasoline when it is pumped into a car's gas tank. A vapor-lock system routes the vapor back into the station's underground holding tanks, where some of it condenses back into liquid. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> ordered vapor-recovery nozzles at service stations in urban areas, where the smog problem is greatest, in 1977. A phase-in period covered 90 percent of the state's 14,000 stations by 1980. Regulations adopted in 1987 extended the requirement to stations in rural areas, with the final few hundred due for conversion in the next six months. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> required the state's larger stations to have the nozzles Jan. 1; smaller stations must comply by next year. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> and several <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> cities have similar laws. Legislation to enact similar programs is pending in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Becker </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> and Territorial Air Pollution Program Administrators in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Consumer complaints in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> have diminished, agreed <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Boswell </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automotive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Repair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. But that does n't mean there are n't still problems, he said. `` The biggest complaint is they're bulky and heavy. When you get a lady of 110 pounds trying to maneuver a double-hose system, it's obviously a problem,'' <PERSON> Boswell </PERSON> said He said the other major concern of the service station owners is installation and operating costs. The vapor recovery nozzle that the motorist sees is only one part of the recovery system. A network of pipes must be installed to return the vapor to the storage tanks. Then the delivery tanker truck must be equipped with a larger version of the recovery nozzle to collect vapor from the station's storage tank and return it to the refinery for reprocessing <PERSON> Boswell </PERSON> said that adds $ 3,000 to $ 5,000 to the cost of a new station, but at least $ 10,000 to $ 15,000 to convert an existing station. In addition to that, the pumps have higher maintenance costs, adding $ 1,500 to $ 2,000 a year to the average station's operating expenses `` The old nozzles cost $ 15 to $ 20 each. Vapor recovery nozzles are over $ 100, and the new light-weight ones are $ 300 per nozzle,'' he said, `` so it does make the price of gasoline go up.'' <PERSON> Boswell </PERSON> said the conversion costs have led to closures of some small stations. `` It does a good job of collecting vapors. There's no dispute over that,'' <PERSON> Boswell </PERSON> said. `` But on-board canisters on the vehicles do a better job.'' <PERSON> Sessa </PERSON> said <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s battle against air pollution involves so many inter-related actions _ including emission standards on vehicles, vapor recovery at service stations, and industrial plant emissions _ that it is impossible to sort out the exact effect of just one program. But he described the vapor recovery requirement as a crucial component to the air quality effort because it reduces the amount of hydrocarbon gases in the atmosphere.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government formally joined a high-stakes technology battle with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> on Tuesday when a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> agency picked five companies to receive government grants to develop high-definition television. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Projects </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> announced that it would immediately open negotiations with the five over how much money to give them. The agency has committed roughly $ 30 million to the high-definition, or HDTV, technology program and has received 87 requests from corporations and laboratories for money. The Pentagon said it could not predict how many other contractors might receive grants. There will definitely be other contractors selected, however, because the five selected Tuesday are all working on the displays _ or what amounts to the picture tube in a standard TV _ for the new technology, the agency said. Other grants are contemplated to companies working on high-definition `` processor technology'' _ the computer brains needed to allow HDTV systems to receive, manipulate and display pictures, maps or video. Four of the five companies selected Tuesday are working on so-called `` projection displays,'' while the fifth is working on a `` plasma flat panel display'' similar to the liquid-crystal displays found on many watches and portable computers, <ORGANIZATION> DARPA </ORGANIZATION> said. The four working on projection displays are <ORGANIZATION> NewCo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Raychem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Menlo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Instruments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Projectavision </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The firm working on plasma displays is <ORGANIZATION> Photonics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Northwood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> NewCo </ORGANIZATION> has told the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> it is working with a subcontractor identified as <ORGANIZATION> Spectra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Physics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Raychem </ORGANIZATION> has listed the <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> as a subcontractor <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Instruments </ORGANIZATION> has listed the <ORGANIZATION> David </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sarnoff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Princeton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, as a subcontractor. <ORGANIZATION> Projectavision </ORGANIZATION> has not identified any partners. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Instruments </ORGANIZATION> also is working on the plasma display technology as a subcontractor to <ORGANIZATION> Photonics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> also is on the Photonics team. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s primary goal is developing an advanced, small TV-type screen that can display text, characters or video signals with great clarity. The monitors would be used inside new helicopters and airplanes, training simulators, other types of vehicles and ommand centers. The department also hopes, however, that by providing money for new research, it can help <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> electronic and semiconductor companies take the lead in developing the next generation of TV sets for commercial use. High-definition television offers the promise of sharper, brighter and wider pictures. A study by the <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> released in March concluded the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must move aggressively into the new HDTV and flat-screen display industries or lose more than 2 million jobs annually and suffer a $ 225 billion trade deficit in electronic goods by the year 2010. If the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> does not compete effectively with the Japanese and other nations in the high-technology arena, the personal computer and semiconductor industries alone could have respective deficits of $ 114 billion and $ 76 billion early in the next century, the report said. Commerce Secretary <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> has estimated that HDTV sales in this country could reach $ 140 billion in the next 20 years.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has failed to show it can ensure the safe operation of a nuclear waste dump in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and may be unable to meet its September target for opening the repository, a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee chairman said Tuesday. Rep. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Synar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., said in an interview that <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Jmes </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> may be moving too fast on the $ 700 million project, a central feature of <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>' plan for cleaning up the enormous amounts of hazardous wastes that have been `` temporarily'' stored at nuclear weapons plants for 40 years `` There is no crisis that requires us to move so quickly,'' said <PERSON> Synar </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Government Operations subcommittee on environment, energy and natural resources. A spokeswoman for the department said it planned to go ahead with the first shipments of radioactive waste to the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant, 2,150 feet below the desert near <LOCATION> Carlsbad </LOCATION>, in September despite mounting congressional criticism. `` We're still of the opinion that we can do it,'' said <PERSON> Christina </PERSON> <PERSON> Sankey </PERSON>. A failure to open the repository in September could have serious ripple effects on the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s nuclear weapons complex, which includes 16 major plants in 12 states. <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrus </PERSON>, for example, has said he will not accept further shipments of radioactive wastes from a <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> weapons plant beyond September. The Rocky Flats plant, near <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, has no room to store its wastes and so might have to close down if <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> carries out its threat to block further shipments. Wastes from <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> and other weapons sites was supposed to have begun moving into the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> repository last October, but the opening was delayed because federal officials could not verify the safety of the design and construction. In setting his September deadline, <PERSON> Andrus </PERSON> sought to force a speedup of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> project. <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> is concerned not only about waste coming into the state from <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, but also about a continuing buildup of hazardous waste generated at the department's <ORGANIZATION> Idaho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> At a hearing before <PERSON> Synar </PERSON>'s subcommittee Monday, the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, the investigative arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, presented a legal opinion that any move by <PERSON> Andrus </PERSON> to block further waste shipments into his state would be unconstitutional. <PERSON> Synar </PERSON> also criticized the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s training of emergency response officials in the states that will be traversed by the waste shipments. The training is designed to ensure that local police, firefighters, doctors and others could respond to an accident involving the radioactive material. `` They've done good training, but they do n't have adequate records to find these people in the event they were needed,'' <PERSON> Synar </PERSON> said. The dump is designed to permanently entomb about one million barrels of wastes from the manufacture of nuclear weapons contaminated with plutonium, which remains radioactive for 24,000 years. At a hearing before his subcommittee Monday, <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> officials raised numerous objections to the department's plan for determining the suitability of the waste repository. <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Fultz </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>'s energy issues office, said, `` In our opinion, <PERSON> DOE </PERSON> has not yet satisfactorily addressed all key issues.'' He criticized the department's plan for putting about 7,000 barrels of waste in the repository in an initial 5-year period testing period. `` Most of the waste that <PERSON> DOE </PERSON> would store ... before making a preliminary determination of compliance with <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s standards is not essential for that purpose,'' he said.

<HEAD>EPA Says Industry Polluting Waterways in 45 States</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Hundreds of industrial plants spread across 45 states are violating water quality standards by releasing toxic chemicals into public waterways and must take steps to curb the pollution, the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanmer </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s assistant administrator for water, said the state standards involved, under federal guidelines, are designed to protect aquatic life and the levels do not necessarily pose a health threat to humans. However, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> officials said the statistics provide the most detailed picture to date of the extent of water pollution from toxic chemical releases by industrial plants and make clear a need for tighter controls. The agency said all but a handful of states have at least some waterways that are contaminated beyond what the government considers environmentally safe because of industrial releases of 126 toxic chemicals, including a variety of substances believed to cause cancer. Ms. <PERSON> Hanmer </PERSON> said in most cases the companies or government entities involved have proper permits and are not violating any laws. But they are under a federal directive to develop cleanup strategies to comply with the standards by a mid-1992 deadline. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> provided no information on levels of releases into specific waterways. The polluters include not only industry, but a dozen federal facilities and 240 local water treatment plants that often are discharging pollutants from industrial sources. The greatest concentration of releases stems from plants in the metal finishing, pulp and paper and natural gas industries, which account for better than 40 percent of the industrial polluters cited. Among the polluters also were several military bases, <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> facilities and the <ORGANIZATION> Alyeska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pipeline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, which has been told to tighten its controls on dumping contaminated water used as ballast in oil tankers. About 40 percent of the 879 polluters cited have submitted plans approved by the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> to bring the toxic releases into compliance by 1992. The remainder have either submitted plans that were rejected or have yet to submit a compliance program, officials said. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> findings, gathered from the states, indicated that: _ 879 facilities in 45 states were releasing toxic chemicals into nearby waterways beyond what government standards consider environmentally safe for aquatic life. _ The releases include a broad range of chemicals including benzene, mercury, nickel, lead, asbestos, arsenic, cyanide and dioxin. _ Nearly 600 stretches of waterway are affected by the releases to a degree that they are in violation of state quality standards. _ Contamination of waterways by at least some of the 126 toxic chemicals was found in all but five states: <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>. The largest number of polluters were found in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state, <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, although <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> officials said in some cases a state had more polluters because of tougher state standards. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> officials suggested that while the statistics from the states provide the best indication so far on the scope of industrial pollution of the nation's waterways, they likely represent only a fraction of the harmful chemicals that are being released into lakes, rivers and streams. The statistics cover only 126 toxic chemicals and do not take into account pollution that comes from `` nonpoint'' sources such as runoffs from agriculture and mining. If those sources are taken into account, said the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>, more than 17,000 stretches of waterway, as much as 10 percent of all of the country's streams and shoreline, are believed to have levels of chemical contamination that warrants corrective action.

<TEXT>
 Framed against majestic, snow-streaked mountains, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> rallied Americans on Tuesday to support his plan for combatting air pollution, saying, `` Nature needs our help.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also touted use of alternative fuels to gasoline, saying that clean-burning fuels `` are going to take the market by storm'' and help the nation achieve his goal of clean air in every <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> city within 20 years. One day after unveiling a proposal for cleaning up acid-rain pollutants, smog and toxic chemicals from the air, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> declared, `` Environmental gridlock must end.'' Despite disputes among energy, mining, chemical and environmental groups about what to do, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` There's one thing everyone agrees on. We need action. And we need it now.'' He said competing interests in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> have `` jammed the avenue to action'' for more than a decade. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spoke to an audience of more than 1,000 residents and tourists in a field at <ORGANIZATION> Teton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. The craggy, snow-filled <LOCATION> Teton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> served as his backdrop. Brilliant blue skies and a blazing sun helped make it a picture-perfect day. Before returning to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> stopped at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nebraska </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lincoln </LOCATION> for a speech in which he pledged support for research on alternative fuels such as ethanol. On the flight to <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was notified the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> had received from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> legislation to raise the minimum wage by $ 1.20 an hour _ to $ 4.55. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ordered that it be sent back with his veto, and the bill returned <ORGANIZATION> Capitol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hill </ORGANIZATION> 59 minutes after it arrived at the White House. In <LOCATION> Lincoln </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spoke before an enthusiastic crowd of thousands in a sports center. He said `` alternative fuel is going to help us reconcile the automobile to our environment.'' After touring an engine-technology laboratory where tests showed that fuels blended with ethanol, made from fermented corn and agricultural wastes, burn cleaner than gasoline, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` We know it's time to cut exhausts. The question is how.'' He called alternative fuels `` an American answer'' that can help reduce the country's dependence on imported oil. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> drove an ethanol-powered Chevrolet <LOCATION> Corsica </LOCATION> compact around a test track twice, with <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> in the passenger's seat. He said later, `` I do n't do a lot of driving these days, so I'm not sure that I'm the best judge, but I enjoyed the ride and it had a lot of pickup _ certainly got more pickup than the 14,000-pound -LRB- presidential -RRB- limousine sitting outside this place. The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> says vehicles that can use both gasoline and methanol, a fuel distilled from natural gas or wood, give off 30 percent less tailpipe pollution, while vehicles that use only methanol show an 80 percent reduction. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s clean-air proposals won general praise from environmentalists, who said his package will be the framework for the first overhaul of the Clean Air Act since 1977. In particular, environmentalists cheered the fact that the initiative originated at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> after eight years of silence on environmental matters from <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. In the pristine wilderness of the Grand Teton National Park, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said every American deserves to breath clean air. `` And you should n't have to drive 2,000 miles to come out here to do it. Environmental gridlock must end.'' On Monday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> toured a fire-blackened geyser basin in Yellowstone National Park. He told the Teton audience that he marveled at nature's regenerative power but said, `` whether restoring a forest or the air that flows above it, nature needs our help. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the medical wastes that washed up on <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> shores last year and the wandering garbage barge that nearly could n't find a port `` helped provide the jolt we that needed'' for environmental action. `` Some say we are running out of time,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` Wrong. the only thing we are running out of is imagination and the will to bring what we can imagine to life.'' Repeating his oft-stated phrase that `` there is a new wind blowing,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that `` borne upon that wind is a new breed of environmentalism. `` Our mission is not just to defend what's left _ but to take the offense, to improve our environment across the board.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` Even the Tetons can not escape the threat of pollution. It comes not from steam engines and logging saws -LRB- which threatened the park in earlier years -RRB- but from the very West Wind that shaped those peaks, bearing the often invisible poisons that gust in from the sun-baked smog of our cities.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who has visited the Tetons several times, said he frequently hears people say how nice it is to get away from urban pollution. `` Well, the bad news is, it can follow you here. But the good news is, we're not going to put up with it any longer. Not here. Not at home where you summer visitors live most of your lives.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> used his speech to announce his selection of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> state senator, as director of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> owns a ranch in <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hole </LOCATION>. National Park Service police removed several demonstrators before <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> arrived for his speech. The protestors had signs denouncing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s handling of the Valdez oil spill. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Northup </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said they were arrested for demonstrating in a national park without a permit and were taken to the <LOCATION> Teton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Tuesday vetoed legislation to raise the hourly minimum wage to $ 4.55, swiftly asserting himself in his first domestic policy clash with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and its majority Democrats. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, traveling in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, vetoed the measure less than an hour after it arrived at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, upstaging Democratic congressional leaders who were still preparing for an event designed as a final plea to him to sign the measure. The Democrats promised to try Wednesday to override the veto, with new <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> saying he would work through the night seeking the 30 or so additional votes he would need. Prospects seemed even less positive for the Democrats in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. White House aides joked about the speed with which the veto came. However, <PERSON> Democrats </PERSON> said the swiftness only highlighted insensitivity to minimum-wage workers who last saw an increase in 1981. In a message to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> accompanying the first veto of his administration, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the Democrats' bill would hurt those it was designed to help. `` This bill would increase the minimum wage by an excessive amount and thus stifle the creation of new job opportunities,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in a message that ran more than 1,500 words. He repeated arguments the administration unsucessfully made in trying to persuade <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to adopt a more modest increase, to $ 4.25 an hour. The bill <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> approved `` would damage the employment prospects of our young people and least advantaged citizens,'' the veto message said. `` It would accelerate inflation. It would not help those in poverty. And thus it would fail to properly reflect the thought behind this measure: to help our lowest paid workers.'' The Democrats attacked those arguments as unfounded, and promised to advance another bill should they fail to override the veto. They also took <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to task for refusing to support the minimum wage increase at a time he is seeking to expand capital gains tax breaks enjoyed primarily by the wealthy. `` It is particularly offensive to millions of poor working Americans that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would veto a bill over 30 cents an hour at the same time that he is pushing hard to give a $ 30,000-a-year tax cut to the very richest Americans,'' <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. `` Those are not the proper priorities for our nation, nor should they be for the president.'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>'s employee relations policy center, said, `` We are encouraged by the president's action today.'' But <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> McEntee </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Muncipal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` This veto is a slap in the face of the working poor.'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, facing a major confrontation with the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in his first full week as speaker, refused to answer directly when asked whether he had any realistic chance of gaining the votes needed to override a veto. `` Hope springs eternal,'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said with a broad smile. But even if <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> could deliver the votes in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> appears destined to prevail. Thirty-five Republican senators have signed a letter pledging to back <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the veto fight _ two more votes than the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> would need to sustain a veto in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The chief sponsors of the legislation, Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., and Rep. <PERSON> Augustus </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, D-Calif., vowed to revive the issue if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wins the initial `` There will be an increase in the minimum wage,'' said <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, `` If not today, then soon.'' In his message, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> again called on <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to pass his own proposal, which would boost the minimum wage from its current level of $ 3.35 an hour to $ 4.25 by January 1992. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s measure also would allow employers to pay all new hires a subminimum wage for six months, a provision he said would prevent most of the job loss he believes would be triggered by a higher minimum wage. Democrats contest the job-loss projections as unfounded and consider <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s subminimum wage proposal a cloaked attempt to allow employers to create a new underclass of low-wage workers. The Kennedy-Hawkins bill calls for a $ 4.55 an hour minimum wage by October 1991, with the first incremental increase taking effect this year, and contains a far more restrictive provision allowing a subminimum to be paid to workers with less than 60 days' work experience. `` My difference with the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is not just about 30 cents an hour,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in the veto measure. `` It is about hundreds of thousands of jobs that would be preserved by my administration's approach as opposed to those that would be sacrificed under the excessive increase included in this legislation. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> insisted he was not surprised by the swiftness of the veto, but the leaders seemed caught off guard. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> had printed statements urging <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to reconsider, only to be told by <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> just before the Democrats' event was to begin that his office had just been informed of the veto. White House officials said the bill arrived at the White House at 1:39 p.m. and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, traveling on Air Force One from <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, was notified by a clerk. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> signed a prepared veto message he had taken on the trip and at 1:55 p.m. authorized the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to affix his signature to another copy of the message and immediately return it to the Capitol. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is unwilling to accept his approach toward raising the minimum wage he would examine the possibility of raising the Earned Income Tax Credit to help the working poor. The credit, originally designed to offset Social Security taxes paid by the working poor, can be worth up to $ 874 a year to a working family with children.

 A report by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s drought task force said Tuesday that rains the past month have helped improve pastures and livestock ranges in much of the nation `` Conditions in 33 states were rated good to excellent, up from 25 last month,'' the report said. `` <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> moved into the top category, while <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> are in the severe-drought category.'' The task force, which is headed by Undersecretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowder </PERSON>, has been meeting each week but will shift to every other week. The next meeting to review the situation will be on June 27, the report said. In a related report, the government's <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Facility </ORGANIZATION> said that `` numerous intense thunderstorms spread severe weather and drenching rain across the central and <LOCATION> southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> plains </LOCATION>, the lower <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, and the Gulf and <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> coast states'' during the week of June 4-10. But dry weather prevailed over much of the northern <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> and portions of the Corn Belt, the report added. The winter wheat crop continued in poor shape in much of the dry area and was said to be in `` mostly fair to poor'' condition during the week. Harvesting was reported to be 26 percent completed in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, eight percentage points behind normal. Corn planted this spring was said to be in mostly `` good to fair'' condition and that planting was 96 percent complete, three percentage points behind the usual pace. `` Planting continued to lag behind normal in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> but reached 90 percent completion in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>,'' the report said. `` In <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, corn planting advanced 16 points, reaching 66 percent completion'' by June 10.

 Curios <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> residents gawked at heavily guarded <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> when they were allowed to cycle and drive around it Tuesday for the first time since the army seized it from student protesters June 4. Pedestrians were not permitted and soldiers and traffic police allowed no stopping as bicyclists and cars passed nearly 40 tanks and armored personnel carriers along the northern edge of the square and a dozen at the southern end. Rolls of barbed wire lined southern corners of the 100-acre square, which was nearly empty. Soldiers armed with rifles stood every 15 feet along the perimeter, facing outward. The stone slabs that pave the square looked charred and scraped in places, but there was no other sign of the battle that raged on its edges the night of June 3-4, when tanks roared in from the east and west. Some students say the army also fired on protesters inside the square, but the government denies this. Most of the shooting was on <LOCATION> Changan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION>, the main road to the square. The government says nearly 300 people were killed, most of them soldiers. Chinese witnesses and Western intelligence say the toll could be as high as 3,000, most of them civilians. Tiananmen Square is the physical and symbolic center of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. On one side stands the former imperial palace, on another the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> the </LOCATION> <LOCATION> People </LOCATION>, the current seat of government. Protesters traditionally have taken their causes to <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION>, from college students who protested <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s ceding territorial rights to foreign countries in 1919, to the tens of thousands who occupied the square in April and May to demand dialogue with the government, a free press and an end to corruption. The square also is a favorite place for <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> residents to stroll, fly kites and eat popsicles. Soldiers quickly cleaned up the students' tents and banners, but the 10-day delay in reopening the square indicates it took longer to erase other signs of the occupation and violent recapture. Some television broadcasts in the past week showed soldiers scrubbing graffiti off the square's monument to revolutionary heroes and scraping up charred debris. Also opened for the first time in weeks was the imperial palace, one of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s top tourist attractions. However, visitors were directed to the north gate and a large portion of the palace compound in the south, closest to the square, was closed without explanation. Hundreds of Chinese tourists, most from out of town, pressed their eyes to cracks in the gate of the closed section but could see only a vast expanse of empty courtyard. `` When you stand here it's as if nothing happened,'' a young woman from the central city of <LOCATION> Nanjing </LOCATION> said, leaning on a carved marble baluster and watched birds circle over the palace's yellow tile roofs.

 <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> took his message of reconciliation and peace directly to the West German people Tuesday, and later said the warm welcome in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> made him feel as if he were in Red Square. Thousands cheered the Soviet president in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>'s packed market square. `` I think this is the biggest thing happening in our relationship, the striving of our people to cooperate and be friends,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told the crowd. Later he told Soviet spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> the welcome was so enthusiastic he felt `` as if he was on Red Square, among his own people.'' Relaying <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s words, <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> told reporters the reception made a `` strong emotional impression'' on <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and the entire <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> delegation. More than 3,000 people crowded into the square outside the 18th-century Town Hall under sunny skies to greet the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader. They chanted `` <LOCATION> Gorby </LOCATION>! <LOCATION> Gorby </LOCATION>!'' and waved <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> flags and a banner saying `` Keep up the good work, <LOCATION> Gorby </LOCATION>.'' Cheers and applause rang through the square after the Soviet anthem was played. Several well-wishers fainted in the crush of bodies behind police barricades. Some banners reflected the German pain at the postwar division of their nation and of the former capital, <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, telling <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> `` German unity _ peace in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'' and, in English, `` <LOCATION> Gorby </LOCATION>, make love not walls.'' That referred to the Berlin Wall. But the crowd hooted and hissed in disapproval when Mayor <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON>, in a brief speech before a ceremonial exchange of gifts, referred to <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> as only the temporary capital of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, `` substituting for <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and his wife <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON> were given a tumultuous greeting as they emerged from their limousine and ascended the steps of the newly renovated Town Hall. When Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> spotted 4-year-old Heinrich-Sebastian Schilling, clad in traditional leather short pants and waving to her, she quickly beckoned him to the balcony where she stood with her husband. The couple hoisted the boy between them and Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> waved the posy the youngster gave her as the crowd again chanted, `` <LOCATION> Gorby </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Gorby </LOCATION>!'' As police helicopters whirred overhead and sharpshooters scanned the crowd from rooftops, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said: `` We are opening a new chapter in our relations.'' After the ceremony, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> greeted well-wishers behind police barricades, smiling and shaking hands along the way. A weekend poll conducted by the television network <ORGANIZATION> ZDF </ORGANIZATION> indicates that 90 percent of West Germans trust <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and his policies of reform and disarmament. A white-haired woman, who said she lost her brother in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> during World War II, called it `` a great honor'' for <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to visit <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>. `` We have great hopes that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> can offer a new future that will benefit both Germanys,'' a 21-year-old student, <PERSON> Martina </PERSON> <PERSON> Feldmann </PERSON>, told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said Tuesday he likes <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>'s small-town atmosphere. He said of the city's greenery and residential character, `` I hope you can preserve that.'' At a welcoming ceremony, he noted that West Germans often refer to <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> as a `` big federal village,'' and he added, `` I think in this case it's good.'' <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, with a population of 300,000 is about the size of <LOCATION> Stavropol </LOCATION>, the southern <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> city that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> managed for many years as <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> grew up on a farm in the <LOCATION> Stavropol </LOCATION> area. <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> was chosen as a temporary capital of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> after World War II by officials who expected someday to return the capital to <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>.

 The future of the American newspaper may depend on such small things as delivering the paper on time and offering prompt refunds for failing to do so, the president and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Batten </PERSON> spoke at a general session on the second day of the three-day convention of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Much of the first two days was devoted to discussions of competition from other media for customers and advertisers, and technology has been a recurring theme. However, the real danger to the future of newspapers is not as much an identifiable competitor as it is the mental attitude of publishers, editors, reporters, printers and circulation personnel, <PERSON> Batten </PERSON> said. `` I think the real danger lies in assuming that because our history has been so successful, we can take our continued success for granted, as some sort of mystical right decreed by the Founding Fathers,'' he said. `` Specifically we have to develop a new, fierce commitment to publishing newspapers and strain to satisfy our customers every day. The days when we could do newspapers our way and tell the world to go to hell if they did n't like the results are gone forever. `` If we persist in doing things the way we want to do them out of ignorance or foolish pride or mule-headedness, our customers are going to fade away. If we look for ways to tell our customers yes, instead of no; if we look for quality for the customers, not just ourselves; if we never take customers for granted; if we make their satisfaction our central, urgent, day-to-day priority, then our future will be every bit as good as our past. And as we all know, that has been very good indeed.'' One way to satisfy customers is to give to the people who contact them every day the power to resolve problems and satisfy complaints. `` Recognizing that fact, we need to turn the authority pyramid upside-down, so power flows to the front lines, where customers are being handled in ways that either please them or frustrate them day after day,'' he said. He said one <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> newspaper gave its customer-relations staff its rules for dealing with complaints written on one side of a small piece of paper. `` It read this way: ` Rule No. 1, use your good judgment in all situations. There will be no additional rules,''' he said. He said that when he took over at <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION>, he discovered that some circulation agents lacked authority to give a 25-cent credit for missed delivery. `` Remember that a 10-year personal subscriber is valued at anywhere from $ 4,000 to $ 8,500,'' he said. `` These people were presiding personally over customers worth from $ 11 million to $ 18 million over the next decade, but we were n't empowering them to extend a 25-cent credit without clearing with the boss. That was crazy, and we fixed that.'' He said money-back service guarantees might be one way to keep subscribers and advertisers happy and advised publishers to encourage their reporters to get close to their communities. Most of it, he said, is just a new way of looking at the business. `` Whatever else we do to get closer to readers and advertisers, we have to guarantee that our newspapers will be their newspapers, not reporters' newspapers or editors' newspapers or publishers' newspapers,'' he said `` We run customers' newspapers.''

 The <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> honor system should formally recognize that every proven violation of the academy's strict honor code does not result in expulsion, an advisory commission recommended Tuesday. `` If the sanction could feasibly be rehabilitation or forgiveness, then you would probably be much more willing to turn in your roommate, or counsel him, -LRB- and -RRB- he would be more willing to admit his guilt or explain what he had done,'' said <PERSON> Wesley </PERSON> <PERSON> Posvar </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Special </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> of the Chief of Staff on the Honor Code and the Honor System. `` I think in a process like that, these 18 - or 19-year-old people would become more mature. The recommendation was among 25 changes suggested by the group, which has just completed a six-months study of the honor system. One major suggested change was to abolish the term `` quibbling,'' which in academy parlance means intentional deception or untruth through use of vague or ambiguous language. `` But basing charges on ambiguous use of language can produce ambiguity of guilt itself, and a case can therefore be made for dropping employment of the word ` quibbling,''' the report stated. Intentional deception would still be an offense. The 13-member commission submitted its report to the secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, who has ultimate authority over the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>. Under the code, which states, `` A cadet will not lie, cheat, or steal, nor tolerate those who do,'' West Pointers are required to turn themselves in or blow the whistle on classmates for rules violations. The report said many cadets have been deterred from following the code, knowing that violators faced possible expulsion. <PERSON> Gorden </PERSON> estimated that in the last two years, there have been from 150 to 160 honor cases annually out of a corps of 4,417. Of those cases, 30 to 40 have gone to trial and six to 12 cadets have been expelled each year. The report also suggested changing the language of the code to put the onus on unethical acts, rather than on cadets who commit them. It advocated changing the language of the code to `` A cadet will not lie, cheat, or steal, nor tolerate such acts by other cadets.'' <PERSON> Posvar </PERSON> said some of the changes recommended are just codifying actual practices at the academy. `` In fact the superintendent and the authorities have made certain exceptions in special circumstances, when there are extenuating circumstances, misunderstanding, poor communication, and cadets have been retained _ forgiven, if you will _ or rehabilitated,'' he said at a news conference in the Pentagon. `` Therefore, rehabilitated cadets were, as persons, being tolerated; they were retained. It was the act, it was the act of lying, cheating or stealing that was prohibited, not the person. Now that's a fine point but it does n't change the essence of the code.'' The report recommended against publishing a rigid schedule of alternatives to expulsion, but rather `` a general categorization is appropriate.'' `` These might include separation -LRB- expulsion -RRB-, temporary reassignment to a rehabilitating position in the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, suspension without pay, or special measure such as counseling, rehabilitation and probation,'' the study said. Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorden </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> commandant, said the cadets have also recently completed a study of the honor system and made many of the same recommendations as the commission. The commission was established to study the code in an atmosphere free from concern over a pattern of cases such as the widespread cheating scandal of 1976, when 136 cadets were expelled, or the football-based cheating scandal of 1951, which led to 83 expulsions.

 Palestinian leaders in the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> on Tuesday asked U.S. Ambassador <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> to urge the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to step up its <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace efforts. The Israeli army demolished four houses and sealed seven others in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> to punish Palestinians accused of attacks on troops and on Arabs suspected of collaborating with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Arabs in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> met with <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> as he made his first trip to the territory, home to more than 700,000 Palestinians, since he became ambassador in December. `` We strongly suggested there has to be more serious intervention on the part of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to get people moving,'' said lawyer <PERSON> Fayez </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahme </PERSON>, who attended a luncheon meeting with <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. Two physicians also participated. <PERSON> Rahme </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> were critical of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s peace initiative, which calls for elections in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> to select Palestinians to negotiate an interim autonomy settlement for the lands. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has backed the initiative but expressed concern that a lack of details, especially on the final status of the territories, will discourage Palestinian acceptance. <PERSON> Rahme </PERSON> would not elaborate on specific Palestinian requests, but said participants told <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> `` there can be no elections without a withdrawal of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> troops,'' or international supervision. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> rejects both ideas. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy officials described <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s visit as `` an orientation trip'' but gave no details. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> declined to talk with reporters. At least 516 Palestinians and 22 Israelis have been killed since the uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation of the territories began in December 1987. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has controlled the territories since capturing them from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. Palestinian groups opposed to <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s attempts to negotiate with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> issued a statement in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, on Tuesday condemning <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> for sending a top official to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> <PERSON> Butros </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghali </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s minister of state for foreign affairs, went to <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> this week to offer <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s services as a mediator between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> on the election proposal. `` We warn our people to be awake to foil the moves of <PERSON> Ghali </PERSON> and <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. An army spokesman said troops demolished the Palestinian homes and sealed the others following arrests of Arab attackers. They included 49 Arabs in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> accused of being part of a squad with links to <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> wing of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, said the spokesman, who can not be identified under military rules. One of the houses sealed was in the Askar refugee camp near <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>. The army said cement blocks were thrown from the house in April, slightly injuring several soldiers. <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Shtawi </PERSON>, 42, who owned the house said no one in his family was detained in connection with the incident and they should not be penalized for the acts of others. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and international human rights organizations have condemned house demolitions, saying they deny people due process under the law since suspects rarely are tried before their houses are destroyed. The Arab-run human rights group <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Haq-Law </PERSON> in the Service of Man says the army has destroyed or sealed more than 330 houses in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and 58 in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> since the start of the uprising. Police Minister <PERSON> Chaim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bar-Lev </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> police arrested two Palestinian suspects in the murder of <PERSON> Oren </PERSON> <PERSON> Baharami </PERSON>, a 13-year-old Israeli who was sexually molested and killed in the <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Jaffa </LOCATION> two months ago. He identified the suspects as a 26-year-old man from <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and a 30-year-old resident of <LOCATION> Rafah </LOCATION>. Hundreds of Arab prisoners in northern <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> rioted at <LOCATION> Megiddo </LOCATION> military jail for security offenders late Tuesday after soldiers fired tear gas at prisoners who refused to leave their tent to be counted, the army said. The riot lasted less than an hour and three prisoners were treated for tear gas inhalation, the army said. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio reported 22 prisoners injured and 10 hospitalized, and said a cloud of tear gas floated 2 miles away.

<HEAD>Bush Urged to Uphold Current Policies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 More than 150 members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> sent a letter to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Tuesday urging him to uphold all current anti-abortion policies. The 154 lawmakers said they were concerned that efforts will be made during this Congress to subvert pro-life policies `` by diluting or repealing laws that prohibit federal funding of or involvement in abortion, here at home as well as overseas.'' They urged <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` to send an early, clear, and unmistakable signal of your intention to veto any appropriations or authorization measure that would undo or weaken current law regarding abortion.'' The representatives number more than the one-third that would be needed to sustain a presidential veto. Rep. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.J. </LOCATION>, co-chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pro-Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION>, said the letter was not aimed at a particular effort to change <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> abortion policy, which prohibits federal funds to encourage or provide abortions where the life of the mother is not in danger. But he said that with a decision expected soon in a <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> abortion case before the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, more action on the issue is expected. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> also said such efforts are likely to be made if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> fails to enact a fiscal 1990 budget on time and is forced to fund government operations with stopgap measures, which continue spending levels of the year before but allow amendments to slip through more easily. Additionally, he noted that a draft rewrite of the Foreign Assistance Act in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> would reverse two current abortion policies. One of the current policies bars funding of any organization that supports coercive abortions as practiced by some countries, including <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The other bars funding of any organization that promotes abortions overseas.

<HEAD>Skinner Warns Airlines Who Want to Sell International Routes</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> warned the nation's airlines Tuesday that he would stop the buying and selling of international routes when it affects competition. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>, in a letter sent to 28 airlines, asserted the department's responsibility to review all foreign route sales, although the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has had antitrust law authority over airlines since Jan. 1. The action was the latest in a series of steps the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has taken to discourage actions that might inhibit competition in the deregulated airline industry. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> earlier expressed concern about proposed takeover of <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> by Pan American or other suitors. Northwest has so far rejected takeover attempts. He also asked the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to look into a planned merger of airline reservation systems owned by <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> and American airlines. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> did not mention any specific airline route sale in his letter, and department spokesman <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Paris </PERSON> said it was meant to apply to any potential sale of international routes. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has already said it would oppose in court <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' plans to sell its Philadelphia-Canada routes and other assets to <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> because <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> already has nearly a third of the flights at <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. `` I view with some concern ... the prospect that carriers might endeavor to sell these valuable international routes after having been selected to operate them,'' <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said, adding that some routes might be acquired primarily for their sale value. The department approves all applications for international routes. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said the sale of routes may affect a carrier's ability to remain an effective competitor or `` adversely affect industry balance.'' In his letter, <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said the department would scrutinize all international route transactions. `` Where we find that the competitive and service benefits that we sought to achieve in making a significant route award would be undermined by a route sale, we will consider giving the incumbent carrier the choice of either continuing to operate its service or relinquishing its certificate in order that the route can be reawarded through another selection proceeding,'' <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said. He said the approach was designed to ensure that route sales `` strengthen, rather than diminish, the competitiveness of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airline industry.''

 <PERSON> Ciriaco </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Mita </PERSON>, who has been caretaker premier since his government fell three weeks ago, was chosen Tuesday to form a new government and said he would try to resurrect the same five-party coalition. He also said no progress could be made in negotiating <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s 49th government since World War II until after European <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> elections Sunday Both <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Mita </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> and their Socialist rivals had hoped President <PERSON> Francesco </PERSON> <PERSON> Cossiga </PERSON> would delay naming a premier-designate until next week, but opposition parties said the delay had brought most government work to a standstill. After meeting with <PERSON> Cossiga </PERSON>, the premier said he would seek to form a government based on an alliance of parties receiving `` the constant, growing consensus of Italians.'' His reference was to several local elections, the latest in <LOCATION> Sardinia </LOCATION> last weekend, in which <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, Socialists and smaller parties in the coalition posted gains. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Mita </PERSON> resigned May 19 after Socialist leader <PERSON> Bettino </PERSON> <PERSON> Craxi </PERSON> said he could no longer support the governing coalition. He accused <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Mita </PERSON> of failing to show leadership. <PERSON> Craxi </PERSON> is a former premier and has made no secret of wanting the job back. With nearly all votes counted in the <LOCATION> Sardinia </LOCATION> election, the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, long <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s dominant party, had 34.9 percent of the vote, up from 32.2 percent five years ago, and the Socialists 13.9 percent, up from 10.1 percent. The Communists, the No. 2 party and currently in a slump, dropped to 23.1 percent from 28.7 percent in the last election. The rest of the vote went to smaller or regional parties. Political commentators said the results showed voters support the coalition, which also includes the Social Democratic, Republican and Liberal parties. They also noted, however, that the trend has not eased the rivalry between the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> and Socialists.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Vines </PERSON> was re-elected president of the Southern Baptist Convention Tuesday, maintaining the conservative resurgence within the nation's largest Protestant denomination. Vines, pastor of <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, captured 56.5 percent of the vote in defeating his moderate challenger, <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Vestal </PERSON>, pastor of <ORGANIZATION> Dunwoody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in suburban <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. Vines received 10,754 votes to 8,248 for <ORGANIZATION> Vestal </ORGANIZATION> in the 11th straight victory for conservative candidates since 1979. More than 20,000 messengers, or delegates, registered for the three-day annual meeting of the 14.8 million-member Southern Baptist Convention, which opened Tuesday morning. Moderates, who came within 700 votes of defeating Vines last year, had hoped the relatively low turnout for the convention outside the Bible Belt would work in their favor, with conservatives unable to bus delegates in for the election. As many as 45,500 delegates have attended recent conventions. But conservatives counted on the power of the incumbency. No incumbent president seeking a second one-year term has lost in recent years and, until the moderate-conservative controversy, incumbents rarely encountered opposition. In his presidential address before the election, Vines, 51, delivered a sermon on evangelism, saying it is the one thing all Southern Baptists can agree on. `` It is time for our denomination to get on the go,'' he said. <PERSON> Vestal </PERSON>, 44, made his last-minute appeals to voters via television, paying for half-hour programs on a local station Sunday and Monday evenings. He said in his televised address the election would determine whether <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptists </ORGANIZATION> will be committed `` to openness and freedom and unity.'' Both candidates are biblical inerrantists who believe the Bible is without error, but their different approaches to doctrinal issues reflect the divisions within the nation's largest Protestant denomination. <PERSON> Vestal </PERSON> said conservatives have been engaged in a power struggle for control of the denomination that has run roughshod over the central Baptist belief in the priesthood of the believer, or that Christians are able to interpret the Bible for themselves. `` I think the issue is freedom: Are Southern Baptists going to be free or are we going to be a controlled denomination? Are we going to be creedal or non-creedal?'' he said. Vines said issues such as whether the world was created in six days or whether the Bible permits the ordination of women are matters of interpretation Baptists can legitimately disagree about. But he and other conservatives contend there is a need to set stricter parameters on theological teachings to preserve denominational unity on central tenants of faith. If the truth of the Bible is questioned, Vines said, even the accounts of the resurrection of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> are open to dispute. The appointive power of the denomination's presidents allows them to exert control over its institutions and agencies. But moderates have shown increasing strength in recent years, winning elections at the state level in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>. At last year's national convention in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, Vines received just 50.5 percent of the vote in defeating <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, a moderate pastor from <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> The denomination grew rapidly in the'60s and'70s to surpass a declining <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> as the nation's largest <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> denomination, but has grown by barely more than half a percent each of the last two years, the lowest growth rate since 1937.

<TEXT>
 Want to buy a ski resort at a bargain, without leaving the comfort of your living room? It was no problem Tuesday for bidders in one of the world's largest real estate auctions conducted via satellite. The bid for the <LOCATION> Maple </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> ski area in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dummerston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, came from one of the three million satellite dish owners around the country who tuned into an auction of more than $ 200 million in real estate. Some of them bid by telephone to the auction, which took place at a convention hall attended by investors and brokers. The 370-acre ski area, which sold for $ 1.2 million, was one of 71 properties in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> auctioned Tuesday at estimated prices ranging from $ 250,000 to $ 20 million. The parcels were varied. One man got a steal with his high bid of $ 35,000 for three houses in <LOCATION> Odessa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. One of the biggest properties was a twin-tower apartment complex near the ocean in <LOCATION> Lynn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, that was expected to sell for about $ 25 million. More than 400 people joined about 100 satellite dish owners who had pre-registered with the organizers of the event, the Indiana-based <ORGANIZATION> Kruse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, a real estate auction company. <PERSON> Kruse </PERSON>, along with the <ORGANIZATION> Boston-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, created the concept of mixing high technology with old-fashioned auctioneering. <PERSON> Kruse </PERSON> held the first satellite real estate auction in November in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and two more are planned for the fall. `` This is the marketing method of the future,'' proclaimed <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Kruse </PERSON>, chief auctioneer of <ORGANIZATION> Kruse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>. `` As telemarketing grows, buyers and sellers are more comfortable with selling by satellite.'' <PERSON> Kruse </PERSON> barked out bids with the distinctive guttural roll of a veteran auctioneer and sprinkled his bids with the quaint hyperbole of a rural auction. `` This is as good as it gets,'' he crowed during one pitch for an office complex in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>. But as he spoke, he was flanked by two huge video screens that beamed his likeness and photographs of the properties to the audience at the <ORGANIZATION> Hynes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> and around the country. And he began many of the bids at well over $ 1 million. Most of the bidders in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> were serious businessmen who sat grimly in their seats, scanning the auction brochure for good investment properties. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> Salsbury </PERSON>, an investor from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, sat in the back row, looking harried as he scribbled down bids in a notebook and pressed the buttons on his calculator to figure out mortgages and loans. `` This is my first time so I do n't know what to expect,'' said <PERSON> Salsbury </PERSON>, who said he was willing to bid a total of between $ 10 and $ 20 million Tuesday. <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Bard </PERSON>, 51, of <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, who came with his wife, <PERSON> Rita </PERSON>, was more relaxed about raising his hand and parting with cash. <PERSON> Bard </PERSON> had to defer to his wife when asked which properties he bid on because he could n't remember. One of <PERSON> Bard </PERSON>'s highest bids was $ 2.1 million for a 63,000 square foot industrial park in <LOCATION> Lowell </LOCATION> `` I got one property to sell and I'll probably buy a couple,'' said <PERSON> Bard </PERSON>. `` I'm not used to real estate auctions. I usually go to car auctions.'' Like others at the auction who registered the highest bids for each property, <PERSON> Bard </PERSON> said he would not know until the end of the event if the parcel had been sold to him. The final decision is up to the seller, all of whom came to represent their properties.

 A senator says attempts by <PERSON> Baltic-American </PERSON> groups to halt the deportation of those suspected of Nazi war crimes to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has no connection with his support for the long fight for freedom in three countries absorbed by the Soviets. Sen. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>, D-Mich., and Reps. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Hertel </PERSON>, D-Mich., and <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON>, R-Pa., arranged for a <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> reception to be held Wednesday, sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baltic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Baltic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, marking Baltic The Baltic states of <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> lost an estimated 20 percent of their population during World War II through executions, mass deportations and flight out of the countries. Baltic Freedom Day commemorates those Baltic republics and the people there who died at the hands of the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> and during the Soviet takeover in 1940. <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> said on Monday that the deportation issue `` has nothing to do with my interest and involvement over many years to try to bring about what's happening, and that is the unraveling of the Russian empire.'' On Tuesday he issued a statement saying, `` I feel personally that all war criminals must be brought to justice and punished, and I strongly support the executive branch of our government on deporting suspected war criminals when the facts warrant.'' Since the mid-1980s, the committee and the league have attempted to block efforts by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to deport war-crimes suspects to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for trial. The groups, which deny they are pro-Nazi or anti-Semitic, say they oppose the deportations because the Soviet system lacks due process and the deportations may constitute diplomatic recognition of the Soviet takeover. The <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baltic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> wants all war criminals, whether communist or fascist, to be brought to justice, <PERSON> Mari-Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Rikken </PERSON>, Estonian representative to the committee, said Monday. The organization is `` unhappy with the concept of making the Soviets an equal partner in justice,'' she said. <PERSON> Chip </PERSON> <PERSON> Berlet </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Political </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, a research institute based in <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, that studies issues related to authoritarianism and fascism, said some eastern European emigre movements split over the question of collaborating with the Nazism, and `` most of the movements that survived intact did so because of collaboration.'' After the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> absorbed the Baltic nations, the organizations in exile sought to bury their differences in a common anti-Soviet cause, <PERSON> Berlet </PERSON> said. The organizations' anti-Soviet stance has pitted them against the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Special </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigations </ORGANIZATION>, which handles cases involving Nazi war crimes. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazeika </PERSON>, at the time vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Baltic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> and now a director of the organization, was active in 1985 efforts to lobby against the <ORGANIZATION> OSI </ORGANIZATION>'s search for war criminals among Eastern European emigrants. <PERSON> Mazeika </PERSON> and officers of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baltic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, through an organization called the <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constitutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> and Security, also fought the <ORGANIZATION> OSI </ORGANIZATION>'s deportation in 1987 of <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Linnas </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <PERSON> Linnas </PERSON> was an Estonian who became an American citizen in 1959 and was sentenced to death by a Soviet court after his conviction for the deaths of thousands in a concentration camp in <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>. `` We are not saying that these people are innocent or that perhaps there could be some guilt,'' said <PERSON> Angela </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelsas </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Baltic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>. The organization would like to change the law `` so that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizens can receive the same due process of law that is expected in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' through criminal trials in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, she said. Neither <PERSON> Hertel </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> responded to requests Monday and Tuesday for comment. The <ORGANIZATION> OSI </ORGANIZATION> said its only contact with the Baltic groups was when they were lobbying against a deportation. `` Frankly, I do n't pay too much attention to them,'' said <ORGANIZATION> OSI </ORGANIZATION> head <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> Shear </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 The Shedd Aquarium is building a huge, $ 43 million oceanarium, but it's having trouble obtaining whales to fill the complex amid waves of protest from activists opposed to capturing the mammals. `` These captures raise havoc with the wild whale population. They disrupt the family units, other whales are injured and some are killed,'' said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Morlan </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Midwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Whale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>. The federation is one of eight animal rights and environmental groups that filed a lawsuit Monday in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to block the aquarium from importing from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> three <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> black whales, also known as false killer whales. The lawsuit comes a week after <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s government refused the aquarium's request for permission to buy three beluga whales from <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay-area </LOCATION> Eskimos. Neither species is considered endangered. Despite the objections, there will be whales in the complex when it opens in fall 1990, said aquarium Associate Director <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Lonsdale </PERSON>. `` We were surprised over the controversy,'' <PERSON> Lonsdale </PERSON> said. `` We feel we are conservationists. We preach conservation in all of our messages.'' He said the Canadians were concerned more about where the whales would be kept before the exhibit opened, and not the exhibit space itself. The aquarium has said the whales will be housed at an aquarium outside <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> while its Oceanarium is completed. The <PERSON> Shedd </PERSON> will reapply for a Canadian permit next year, <PERSON> Lonsdale </PERSON> said. As envisioned, the Oceanarium will be a 170,000-square-foot exhibit with a 2 million-gallon pool for the false killer whales and a 400,000-gallon pool for the belugas. The $ 43 million construction cost is coming from a variety of sources, including state aid. The lawsuit said the federal permit <PERSON> Shedd </PERSON> received for importing the animals from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> should be revoked until that country bans its fishermen from killing whales. The Japanese annually drive false killer whales to shore and slaughter them with harpoons or knives, sparing a few for sale to aquariums, said <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON>, an attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>, one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit. Ms. <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> permit violates a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law banning the importation of marine mammals from countries that do n't give the animals the same protection they have in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` We want to protect the wild populations and stop the killings in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>,'' Ms. <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> said. `` This is no way to do it _ by paying them to save a few.'' The other plaintiffs are <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Humane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Humane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Cetacean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. Aquarium officials deny any laws were broken. They contend that if they did n't import the whales, the animals would be slaughtered, and that the exhibits benefit people who have no other place to learn about the creatures. `` We're serving an important function,'' <PERSON> Lonsdale </PERSON> said. `` The educational value of the exhibits is they help people understand conservationist concerns.'' While the plaintiffs acknowledge the exhibits help increase awareness of the whales' plight, many say they oppose confining creatures that normally range thousands of miles. Education `` ca n't take priority over protecting the animals in the wild,'' Ms. <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> said. `` We do n't want to protect the whales by putting them all in aquariums.'' <PERSON> Lonsdale </PERSON> countered that the aquarium handles marine animals with utmost care. `` We feel we do the best job we can of keeping'' the animals, he said. `` Their life here is very good. They have a very pleasant existence.''

 A police psychologist was slain Tuesday, a labor leader was abducted and businessmen called a four-hour strike to protest the killing last week of a senior <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> minister. Gunmen killed <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Angel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>, a civilian psychologist employed by the security and investigations department of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION>, and his body was found in the eastern suburb where he lived, police sources said.

The strike coincided with the visit of Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, who called on the <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> family to express condolences. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> joined the government in blaming the assassination on guerrillas of the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, known as the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION>. `` That type of violence was perpetrated by the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> and the leftist guerrillas can not be tolerated,'' the vice president said.

But officials at the embassy said <PERSON> Mazariego </PERSON> had already been issued a visa. <PERSON> Mazariego </PERSON> was to have begun the trip Tuesday. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> said the union leader was picked up by government security men in March and questioned for three days. <PERSON> Denys </PERSON> <PERSON> Everingham </PERSON> of Local 1034 of the <ORGANIZATION> Communication </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Trenton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, said by telephone that <PERSON> Mazariego </PERSON>, an official of the <ORGANIZATION> Salvadoran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, was scheduled to speak in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> on Thursday. She said he also was to attend a union meeting Monday in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, but added: `` We're not sure if we're going to be having an event or if we're going to be having a memorial service at this point.'' A conservative Salvadoran business group, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Private </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION>, said it sponsored Tuesday's strike as `` a show of repudiation of all forms of terrorism and an expression of solidarity with efforts to achieve the peace that the <LOCATION> Salvadoran </LOCATION> people yearn for.

 <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> won senior citizens' hearts and charmed guests at fund-raisers for a Republican congresswoman in a whirlwind visit to <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> arrived at T.F. Green State Airport around 11:30 a.m., attended two fund-raisers at a hotel for Rep. <PERSON> Claudine </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>, visited a senior citizens center in suburban <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> and left shortly after 2 p.m.. About 30 people waited outside the <LOCATION> Omni </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Biltmore </LOCATION> hotel for a glimpse of the popular first lady, but the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> forced them out from under an awning and into the rain to make room for her entourage Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told about 700 people who paid $ 150 to $ 1,000 apiece to attend the fund raisers about her husband's programs and her campaign for literacy, but did n't mention the campaign Miss <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> is contemplating against Sen. <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, next year. Asked about the potential Pell-Schneider contest at a hotel news conference, Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> initially ducked the issue. `` I like her just where she is today,'' the first lady said. A few minutes later, she said, `` <PERSON> Claudine </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> is qualified for anything. ... I'm just not going to fool around in the internal politics of <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. She can be anything.'' The 42-year-old congresswoman was first elected to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1980, and has built a reputation as an environmental advocate. She has yet to declare her plans for 1990. The fund raisers raised about $ 170,000, said <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> spokeswoman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Rendine </PERSON>. At the <ORGANIZATION> Cranston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> center, about two dozen schoolchildren and a handful of adults awaited Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, but the most they got was a glimpse of her red suit and trademark triple strand of fake pearls. Her folksy, down-to-earth personality, though, won rave reviews from senior citizens. `` There's no airs about her. I think she's great,'' <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Cirelli </PERSON> of <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> said as she watched Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> join about 20 people dancing to the tune, `` <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was less successful as she took several shots with a pool cue in the center's pool room. `` Do I have to call a ball?'' she asked. `` No, you have executive privilege,'' a player replied. After missing an easy shot, Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> turned and said, `` You ought to see me on the tennis court.''

 A homeless man who spent a rainy night in a big cardboard box near a loading dock with two friends was killed while he slept Tuesday morning when the box was flattened by a truck. The three homeless men, who had been friends on the street in the area for the last couple of years, took a carton that once held 10 bicycles from a trash bin behind a Toys ` R' Us toy store to shield them from Monday night's foul weather, the survivors said. Along with a dog belonging to the victim, they crawled under the front of a trailer parked at the store's loading dock, then fell asleep after drinking beer and alcohol. Tuesday morning, truck driver <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, 39, of <LOCATION> Bayonne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, said he was backing up his tractor to connect it to the empty trailer when he saw the dog jump out of the cardboard box. <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said he thought there might be puppies in the box, so he got down to investigate and saw <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Beres </PERSON>, one of the homeless men, who shouted angrily: `` There's people in that box! You just ran over my friend!'' Police identified the victim as <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON>, 36. The others escaped injury. <PERSON> Beres </PERSON>, 33, said he was awakened by <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON>'s screams. The third man, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, 30, said he slept through the accident. <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> had been sleeping in the middle of the three men and apparently the rear wheels of the tractor rolled over his chest, said <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Detective <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Brock </PERSON>. `` He was a real good friend,'' said <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>.

 Scientific researchers in American universities should be required to disclose financial relationships with industry that might create conflicts of interest, a congressional subcommittee was told Tuesday. `` Biomedical science has been intensely commercialized within universities over a relatively short period of time,'' said <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON> <PERSON> Krimsky </PERSON>, associate professor of urban and environmental policy at <ORGANIZATION> Tufts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` I have heard it said within the scientific community that everyone gains from this marriage of academia and commerce. Nothing can be further from the truth. `` Not only are there losses, but some of these losses threaten the integrity of our scientific institutions and weaken public confidence in science.'' <PERSON> Krimsky </PERSON> said that at least 45 per cent of the biomedical faculty at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>, as an example, have formal affiliations with 36 biotechnology companies. He called for disclosure of financial interests related to research being conducted by scientists applying for grants. Dr. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lundberg </PERSON>, vice president for scientific information of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, cautioned, however, that barring researchers from working in areas where they had a financial interest `` would be devastating, and we would lose many qualified people and we would lose much information that would have come from those people if they had worked.'' `` A lot of things motivate human beings, and money's one of the big ones,'' <PERSON> Lundberg </PERSON> said. He said that if he had been a journal editor in 1905 looking for somebody to write an article on automobiles, he would have asked <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>. `` Would <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> have been in conflict of interest? Totally,'' he said. `` Would I care? No. I'd love that. He'd know the most about it.'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Noble </PERSON>, a professor of history at <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> who is suing the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> on grounds that he was fired for speaking out against conflicts of interest, said university researchers `` are free to make undisclosed arrangements with private corporations in which they often have equally undisclosed personal roles.'' `` They are free to shape and profit from the public investment in research and many have done so,'' he said. He argued that such collaboration between universities and industries should be accompanied by `` proper disclosure and procedural safeguards.'' Noble criticized <ORGANIZATION> MIT </ORGANIZATION>'s Industrial Liaison Program, in which he said firms pay a membership fee to the institution and gain access to research publications and other information. He told the subcommittee that `` nearly all the member corporations of the <ORGANIZATION> ILP </ORGANIZATION> were multinationals with no necessary allegiance to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, that fully half of them were foreign, that 57 of them were major Japanese competitors, and that the <ORGANIZATION> ILP </ORGANIZATION> had for nearly a decade been operating an overseas sales office in downtown <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> MIT </ORGANIZATION>, told the panel that the institution `` would not operate this program were its only benefit a stream of revenue.'' `` The educational and research functions of this science-based university require broadly-based understanding of industrial practice and industrial needs,'' <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> said `` The ILP is an important vehicle for developing that understanding, and this is its principal benefit to the institute.'' <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Woolf </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Woodrow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wilson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, agreed that such arrangements can be beneficial but said the subject needs further study. Dr. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Blumenthal </PERSON>, senior vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Brigham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, said that `` academic research institutions must insist on disclosure of relationships with industry that may create economic conflicts of interest.'' Rep. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, chairman of the human resources subcommittee of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` I am sure that many Americans will be justifiably outraged by some of the ways that federally funded scientific data are being sold, or manipulated for personal gain.'' Rep. <PERSON> Larkin </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, the ranking Republican on the panel, said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should `` send a strong signal to the research community that scientific misconduct will not be tolerated.'' At the same time, he said, `` A careful balance must be struck between avoiding conflicts of interest and achieving scientific breakthroughs that ultimately could benefit millions. We should not allow limited or individual cases of misconduct to stand in the way of overall progress.''

 President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> said Tuesday it is time for the backers of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s anti-communist rebels _ <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> _ to prove their sincerity and offer specific proposals for ending the civil war. `` We ask the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to consider the realities in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and aim for a peaceful settlement and restoration of peace,'' he said in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> at his office near the Presidential Palace. `` We believe that not only American public opinion but international opinion will demand this because the atrocities by the opposition inside <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> are against the humanitarian principles of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' he said. The 43-year-old president spoke of his Marxist government's efforts to achieve a negotiated settlement to the war and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Pakistani policies President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Prime Minister <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> agreed during their meetings in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> last week to search for a political settlement to the <LOCATION> Afghan </LOCATION> conflict. The revolt began after leftist officers seized power in 1978 and tried to impose Marxism in this predominantly Moslem country. At least 1.3 million people have been killed in the war and about 5 million Afhans _ a third of the population _ have sought refuges in neighboring <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> also agreed, however, that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should continue providing weapons to the rebels and seek an end to <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s rule. `` It is too early to determine whether they are serious and sincere,'' <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> said of the two leaders. `` How can one talk about a political settlement and reject one side in the conflict _ the government of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>?,'' he asked. `` Rendering military assistance to the armed opposition means nothing but continuing war. Rendering military assistance to those who openly refuse a political settlement actually means continuing war and bloodshed and therefore preventing a political settlement.'' The guerrillas refuse to negotiate with <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> but their campaign to topple his government has stalled. There are doubts within the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration that the fractious rebel alliance based in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> will succeed. Pakistani officials have said the guerrillas could negotiate with the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government if <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> and prominent members of the governing <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> were removed from power. They also expressed hope the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can press <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to drop its insistence that the party be part of any future government. <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>, a physician, was tapped by the Soviets in May 1986 to replace <PERSON> Babrak </PERSON> <PERSON> Karmal </PERSON> and then was elected president in November 1987 by the <ORGANIZATION> Grand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, the highest governing body in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. He has said he would step down if that would guarantee peace in his war-devastated country. After the last Soviet troops left <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> on Feb. 15, many in the West predicted the government would collapse within weeks or months. The guerrillas switched from hit-and-run tactics and launched a frontal assault on the eastern city of <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> in early March and later offensives on the southern cities of <LOCATION> Khost </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION>. But the Afghan armed forces held their ground, bolstering the government's confidence. `` How do we look weak or strong?'' <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> asked, speaking through an interpreter. `` They have n't had a single military victory. How should we feel?'' With his troops able to stand alone, <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> has stepped up calls for a cease-fire, peace talks and formation of a coalition government, to be followed by election of a new government. He has appealed to some guerrilla field commanders and their fighters to accept a truce. Major commanders rejected his offer but <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> said about 60,000 guerrillas agreed to stop fighting and negotiations were continuing continued. The Soviets intervened in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979 and sent more than 100,000 military personnel into the country to help the government. <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> directed many of his remarks toward <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` Children ... are being killed in cold blood. Is that what Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would want for the American children? Everyday hundreds of women are grieving over the loss of their loved ones. Is that what Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would want for <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> women?'' he said. `` Does the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> want fundamentalists, extremists and terrorists or a government based on democratic principles, nonaligned and neutral. Has n't the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> states tasted the bitter pill of extremism?'' he asked, possibly referring to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s fundamentalist Islamic government `` Does it want another one in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>?'' <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> said, `` Our position is crystal clear _ the only practical and realistic solution for the cessation of war between all sides is to sit around a negotiating table and form a colaition government.''

<HEAD>Customs Said Planning Rewards For Capture of World's Drug Kingpins</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Customs Commissioner <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabb </PERSON> is seeking <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> approval of a plan to offer rewards of up to $ 5 million for capture of the world's `` big-time drug dealers,'' officials said Tuesday. Known as `` Operation Paladin'' for the gun-slinging Wild West character in the television show `` Have Gun Will Travel,'' the reward fund would tap money from the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s asset forfeiture fund, said a congressional source who spoke on condition of anonymity. Customs spokeswoman <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamor </PERSON> acknowledged the agency is seeking approval of a plan to offer rewards for help in arresting international drug kingpins, but said she could not confirm details of the plan. `` It's in the planning stages,'' Ms. <PERSON> Hamor </PERSON> said. `` The commissioner is seeking approval.'' She declined to say where the approval would come from. A government official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the bounty would provide rewards from $ 1 million to $ 5 million, and must be approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The source said the funds could come from the assets forfeited by convicted drug felons. The congressional source familiar with the plan said Customs was drawing up a kind of `` Most Wanted List,'' and that it starts with Panamanian Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. Also being considered for the list are leaders of the ruthless <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Cali </ORGANIZATION> cartels of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, and an alleged drug dealer from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, the sources said. `` There will be opposition to this from within the drug enforcement community,'' one official said. `` You'll see people whose turf has been trod upon.'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was indicted in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> last year on charges he violated <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> racketeering and drug laws. He is accused of providing protection and other services for international drug traffickers and of using <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> as a transfer point for cocaine and marijuana. The indictment also alleges <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> permitted laundering of drug profits through Panamanian banks. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities say there are two principal trafficking cartels in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> _ one based in the city of <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, the other in <LOCATION> Cali </LOCATION>, and that they control about 80 percent of the cocaine smuggled into <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Colombian drug traffickers families have been been blamed for the deaths of an attorney general, a minister of justice, more than 50 judges, more than a dozen journalists and more than 400 police and military personnel in the past four years.

<TEXT>
 The Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is `` blind'' for not recognizing the opposition victory in the May 7 elections, presidential candidate <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> said Tuesday. He spoke with reporters after talks with a four-man <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> team seeking to resolve <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s political crisis that deepened when the government anulled the May elections. The <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> delegation is trying to arrange negotioations between the opposition, headed by <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>, and the government controlled by Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, commander of the Defense Forces. Prospects appear dim. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had rejected talks and the opposition insists the only solution is <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s resignation a recognition of its electoral victory. `` The way out of the crisis is what the people did on May 7,'' said <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>, who was beaten up by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> supporters after the elections. International observers said the opposition had a winning margin of 3-1 in the balloting. `` The <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> is blind. They do n't understand the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> people,'' <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> said. `` They must understand the people, stop pressuring them and tell them that what they said on May 7 is what matters.'' The <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> group, on its second trip to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, met Tuesday with legislative leaders. <PERSON> Celso </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrizo </PERSON>, the pro-Noriega leader of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, said he told the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> diplomats they first should tackle the issue of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> role in his country. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and his supporters blame the crisis on <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, which they accuse of wanting to renege on 1977 treaties ceding the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> to local control at the end of the century. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> supports attempts to oust <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who has been indicted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on drug trafficking charges.

Department spokeswoman <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Beck </PERSON> said <PERSON> Buschmann </PERSON>, an actor turned leftist guerrilla, was arrested in <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, on Monday during a stopover en route to <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> after he was deported from <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. `` This is a legal and diplomatic matter which is being studied by both -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Chilean -RRB- governments,'' Ms. <PERSON> Beck </PERSON> said, adding that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wants `` justice to be served in this matter.'' Complicating a Chilean extradition request is <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s refusal since 1979 to extradite to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Contreras </PERSON>, former head of the Chilean intelligence services. <PERSON> Contreras </PERSON> and another Chilean is wanted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in connection with the assassination in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> of <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Letelier </LOCATION>, former Chilean foreign minister. Letelier was killed by a remote-controlled bomb planted in his car in September 1976. Riding in the car with him, and also killed, was an American assistant, <PERSON> Ronni </PERSON> <PERSON> Moffitt </PERSON>. Capt. <PERSON> Armando </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Larios </PERSON>, who surrendered to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities out of remorse for his participation in the Letelier assassination, said <PERSON> Contreras </PERSON> masterminded the plot. <PERSON> Buschmann </PERSON> is wanted in <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> in connection with the Sept. 7, 1986, attempt to kill <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>. He has said in news conferences since his escape that he played a key role in the smuggling of a huge guerrilla arms cache into <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> in 1986. <PERSON> Buschmann </PERSON> has been a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Manuel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rodriguez </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patriotic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s principal leftist guerrilla group. Two years ago he escaped from a prison in <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, where he faced arms-smuggling charges. He has been granted residence and political-exile status in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, but he was visiting <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> when the Chileans were seeking his extradition. Rather than extradite <PERSON> Buschmann </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> deported him last Saturday. Australian authorities accused him of `` unacceptable activities.'' He was raising funds for the guerrilla group and publicly called for the assassination of <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Ethiopian Rebels Accept Government Offer of Peace Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An Ethiopian rebel group said Tuesday it accepts a government offer of peace talks and hopes they will lead to democracy in this strategic Horn of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> nation. The <ORGANIZATION> Tigre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, one of the rebel organizations fighting for autonomy in northern <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, announced in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> that it `` is prepared to take advantage of any possibility, however small, to work for a peaceful solution.'' The Ethiopian <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> adopted a peace plan June 5 calling for unconditional talks with insurgents in the presence of an international observer. The Tigre rebels challenged the government to start negotiations within one month `` to minimize the continuing appalling human and material costs of the war.'' But a larger insurgent group, the <ORGANIZATION> Eritrean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> that has been fighting for 28 years for independence of the province neighboring Tigre, has not responded to the government proposal. President <PERSON> Mengistu </PERSON> <PERSON> Haile </PERSON> <PERSON> Mariam </PERSON> ordered the special session of the <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> to consider the peace plan less than three weeks after his Marxist government crushed a coup attempt by war-weary generals. Diplomats said the attempted coup and its failure sent army morale plunging to new depths, with the morale already low because of defeats in Tigre and <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION>. The Tigrean rebels, among <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s many ethnic minorities, want restoration of democratic rights, an immediate cease-fire, the release of political prisoners and freedom for exiles to return. Their peace plans also calls for dismantling of the government's `` repressive security institutions,'' the expulsion of foreign military forces, and creation of a provisional government from all political organizations until a constitution is adopted and a democratic government elected The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is <ORGANIZATION> Mengistu </ORGANIZATION>'s main backer, providing military aid and support. <ORGANIZATION> Mengistu </ORGANIZATION> inherited the northern insurgencies from the regime of Emperor <PERSON> Haile </PERSON> <PERSON> Selassie </PERSON>, who annexed the former Italian colony of <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION> in 1962. <ORGANIZATION> Mengistu </ORGANIZATION> ousted Selassie in a coup in Sept. 12, 1974. Both the rebel groups and the government espouse Marxism.

 A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cargo plane that crashed in <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION> 18 years ago is ready to fly to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> after a $ 10 million effort to recover the aircraft from its icy tomb, officials said Tuesday. The <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> C-130 Hercules is to return to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on June 26 now that the three-year salvage effort has been completed, said <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zealand </ORGANIZATION> engineering manager <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Geddes </PERSON>. The airline salvaged the four-engine transport aircraft under a contract with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Geddes </PERSON> said a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> crew was due in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> this week to begin test flights before making the long trip to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. The plane was heavily damaged when it crashed in 1971 as it tried to take off from a remote <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> airfield. One of the motors on the fuselage used to assist take-off had broken free, ripping through an engine and the fuselage. Not one of those aboard was injured. The aircraft was stripped of crucial equipment and left in the harsh <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> environment, where it quickly became covered with 40 feet of snow and ice. <PERSON> Geddes </PERSON> said director of polar projects for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, Dr. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkniss </PERSON>, won permission three years ago to recover the crashed Hercules. He said a new Hercules would have cost about $ 50 million. During the early stages of the recovery, another Hercules aiding the salvage effort crashed, killing two airmen. Repair work at the icy site, which included fitting new wings to the plane, allowed the aircraft to be flown 3,100 miles in January 1988 from <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Christchurch </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>.

 Thunderstorms drenched much of the nation's southern half Tuesday, causing floods that stranded up to 200 people at a trailer park and forced the evacuation of about 80 people in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>. Flooding caused morning rush-hour traffic jams in the <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> area, and the body of a young man swept away by <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> floodwaters Monday was recovered. `` There's flooding just about all over the place,'' <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Director T.E. <PERSON> Bingham </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Leflore </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, which received at least 4 inches of rain. The thunderstorms that caused some of the worst problems fell from eastern <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> to northeast <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, dumping 4 -LCB- inches of rain on <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> in seven hours. Strong thunderstorms brought strong winds and heavy downpours to the lower <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> from western <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> to northwest <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, and widely scattered storms fell along the Gulf Coast from <LOCATION> northwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> to southern <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>. The rains caused many rivers to rise from the <LOCATION> southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>. The Trinity River in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> was 6 feet above flood stage, and was expected to rise to 9 feet above flood stage. Flash flood watches were in effect in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>. Flooding prompted the evacuation of about 75 people in <LOCATION> Apache </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, nearly 200 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and five children in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, officials said. Water up to 6 feet deep stranded as many as 200 people at a recreational vehicle park in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, officials said. A nearby trucking company used a tractor-trailer rig to ferry out residents, many of them elderly. `` Needless to say everybody was traumatized,'' said <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Titusville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> `` There will be lots and lots of damage.'' High water closed several <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> roads and bridges, including <LOCATION> Okalhoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> exit ramps from Interstate 40. In <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, the body of <PERSON> Deryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinkston </PERSON>, 18, who was swept away by swollen <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> as he and four friends tried to grab a raft Monday afternoon, was recovered Tuesday at a golf course, police said. Flooding also occurred in the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> communities of <LOCATION> Greenwood </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Drew </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Ruleville </LOCATION>. A severe thunderstorm watch was in effect for a large section of central and northeast <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, and thunderstorms formed over the northern <LOCATION> Panhandle </LOCATION> and northern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Thunderstorms also developed in the <LOCATION> Carolinas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. A severe thunderstorm watch was in effect in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>. Rain and drizzle fell from eastern sections of the <LOCATION> Dakotas </LOCATION> to the upper Great Lakes region, and scattered showers fell from northern <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> to southern <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. Showers also fell on parts of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. Much of the nation's western third had fair weather. Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 44 degrees in <LOCATION> Hancock </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Sawyer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, to 104 in Needles, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. The low for the 48 contiguous states was 32 degrees in <LOCATION> Houlton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. The forecast for Wednesday called for showers and thunderstorms from much of the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> to the Great Lakes, the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> valleys, the Gulf Coast, the middle and lower <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> and southern and eastern <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>; scattered afternoon showers and thunderstorms in central <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>; and showers over much of the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION>. High temperatures were predicted in the 50s and 60s from the northern and central Plains to much of the upper and middle <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>; the 60s along the central and northern <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>; the 90s from the middle and southern <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and from south central <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> to inland <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> and inland <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>; over 100 degrees in the desert <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION> and near the Big Bend of the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>; and in the 70s and 80s in the rest of the nation.

<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> study released Tuesday reports `` significantly elevated'' death rates for patients at 44 veterans hospitals and `` likely quality of care problems'' at 22 of the medical centers. The study, based on a detailed analysis of selected cases, said the quality of care problems were most pronounced at hospitals in <LOCATION> Tuskegee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Battle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich </LOCATION>. In the Tuskegee center, the report said that three of 12 cases, 25 percent of those studied, were judged to have `` likely quality of care problems.'' At <LOCATION> Battle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>, likely problems were found in 12 of 59 cases, or about 20 percent. Veterans Affairs Secretary <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> ordered the report released but said in a letter to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that the report `` did not represent a particularly effective use of VA resources.'' He said the report carries the qualifying note that `` no general statement about the quality of care within -LRB- Veterans Affairs -RRB- can be drawn from these findings.'' Nonetheless, <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> said, `` we must try to do better.'' He said the department must conduct a more extensive review `` so that the American public and especially our veterans have confidence in what we do. ... Independent oversight is essential to the credibility of VA.'' The report was initiated two years ago, when the hospitals were operated by the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. The VA was elevated to the Cabinet-level Department of Veterans Affairs in March, when <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> was sworn in. A statement by the department said that the mortality study of veterans hospitals was initiated in 1987 after a separate federal study was conducted of mortality rates at community hospitals treating Medicare patients. Officials `` determined that a similar study within the VA system might be a useful adjunct to new quality assurance intitiatives the agency was undertaking,'' the statement said. `` But differences in <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION>'s methodology meant its results can not be compared with ... data on community hospitals.'' <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a spokesman for the Veterans of Foreign Wars, said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that the mortality figures reflect cutbacks in funds allocated for the hospitals. `` The <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> has had to limit care to those who are the neediest, the sickest,'' he said. `` This may account for the higher mortality rate.'' The new mortality report is based on a review of 1,771 deaths in 1986 among patients at the 172 vterans hospitals around the country. Records for the dead patients were reviewed by several levels of evaluators and judged against a scale of predicted death based on several factors, such as patient age, condition, nature of the illness and type of care. From this study, the report concludes that 44 medical centers had `` significantly elevated mortality rates for at least one of four'' patient categories. Fifteen of the veterans' medical centers were judged to have mortality rates lower than expected. Evaluators ordered 123 of the 1,771 cases to be reviewed by a group of doctors not associated with the hospitals, a system called peer review. Of the 123 cases examined in detail, two groups of peer reviewers found 90 cases at 22 centers in which the care given was not consistent with current medical practice. `` The agreement of two peer reviewers on these 90 cases makes it appropriate to describe them as having ` likely' quality of care problems,'' the report said. The hospitals with higher-than-predicted death rates are in these cities: <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La </LOCATION>.; <LOCATION> Asheville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Battle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Biloxi </LOCATION>, Miss.; <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Chillicothe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>, S.

In addition to Tuskegee and <LOCATION> Battle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>, there were 20 medical centers judged to have `` likely quality of care problems.'' These centers, with the number of patients evaluated, the number found to have problems and the percentage are: <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION> _ 54 cases; 1 with a problem, for a quality of care problem rate of 2 percent. <LOCATION> Asheville </LOCATION> _ 15 cases, 2 problems, 13 percent. <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> _ 26 cases, 3 problems, 12 percent. <LOCATION> Chillicothe </LOCATION> _ 12 cases, 2 problems, 17 percent. <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> _ 36 cases, 1 problem, 3 percent. <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION> _ 101 cases, 6 problems, 6 percent. <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> _ 69 cases, 7 problems, 10 percent. <LOCATION> Durham </LOCATION> _ 34 cases, 2 problems, 6 percent. <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> _ 106 cases, 10 problems, 9 percent. <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> _ 34 cases, 1 problem, 3 percent. <LOCATION> Leavenworth </LOCATION> _ 45 cases, 3 problems, 7 percent. <LOCATION> Loma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Linda </LOCATION> _ 165 cases, 8 problems, 5 percent. <PERSON> Marion </PERSON>, Ind. _ 72 cases, 5 problems, 7 percent. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> _ 91 cases, 1 problem, 1 percent. <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> _ 71 cases, 1 problem, 1 percent. <PERSON> Salisbury </PERSON> _ 79 cases, 11 problems, 14 percent. <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> _ 48 cases, 3 problems, 6 percent. <LOCATION> Waco </LOCATION> _ 39 cases, 5 problems, 13 percent. <PERSON> Walla </PERSON> <PERSON> Walla </PERSON> _ 11 cases, 1 problem, 9 percent. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> _ 58 cases, 2 problems, 3 percent.

 Disturbed two National Endowment for the Arts grants were used for `` morally reprehensible trash,'' Rep. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Armey </PERSON> said Tuesday he would seek to slash <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION> funding unless it adopts guidelines that end `` this horrible abuse of tax dollars'' The <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> said he has collected the signatures of 107 <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members protesting the use of tax money on projects they deem inappropriate because of sexual or moral content. <PERSON> Armey </PERSON> said he met Tuesday with <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Southern </PERSON>, acting chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION>, to discuss guidelines for grant recipients that `` clearly pay respect to public standards of taste and decency.'' <PERSON> Armey </PERSON> also wants the agency to consider a potential recipient's past work when handing out grants Also at the meeting with Southern were Reps. <PERSON> Sid </PERSON> <PERSON> Yates </PERSON>, D-Ill., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Appropriations subcommittee on <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Murtha </PERSON>, D-Pa., a member of the Southern said late Tuesday that he believes the <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION> can craft `` something that's agreeable to all parties that does n't get into any kind of chilling of expression.'' Southern said the peer panels that review grant applications and make recommendations to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION>, which advises the <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION>, `` in general do a very good job of advising us. On very rare occasions, they may recommend something that may be offensive to some people.'' But the NEA `` can not absolutely guarantee none of our grants go to exhibits or works that do not offend anyone,'' Southern said. <PERSON> Armey </PERSON> said that while he welcomed Southern's promise, `` we have had verbal assurances in the past and they've done no good.'' The first NEA grant that prompted the protest was to artist <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Serrano </PERSON>, who received $ 15,000 in 1987 and created a picture of the Crucifix which he submerged in a jar of urine. The second was a $ 30,000 award last year to support a national tour of a 150-piece photographic retrospective called `` <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mapplethorpe </PERSON>: The Perfect Moment.'' <PERSON> Armey </PERSON> complained in his letter to Southern that the exhibit includes `` nude photographs of children, homoerotic shots of men and a sadomasochistic self-portrait of the artist, and other morally repugnant materials of a sexual nature.'' The Corcoran Gallery of Art on Monday canceled its planned exhibit of the photographs because of concerns it would become embroiled in a battle over federal arts funding, according to gallery officials. `` The Corcoran's withdrawal from the exhibit's tour is not a comment on the quality of the artist's work. Neither is it an abrogation of the artist's right of free expression. Nor does it question the Endowment's award system,'' said gallery director <PERSON> Christina </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr-Cahall </PERSON>. <PERSON> Armey </PERSON> wrote in his letter, `` We realize that the interpretation of art is a subjective evaluation, but there is a very clear and unambiguous line that exists between what can be classified as art and what must be called morally reprehensible trash.'' If <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION> fails to make progress in writing the new guidelines when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> considers next year's budget later this year, <PERSON> Armey </PERSON> said he would consider cutting the agency's funding. If the guidelines are n't in place by next year, he threatened even tougher cuts in the following year's budget. `` The graphic evidence is there I'd win those votes,'' <PERSON> Armey </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> on Tuesday asked rightist political leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Aubuisson </PERSON>, a man long linked to death squads, not to embarrass the new government and urged leftist politicians to cut ties with guerrillas, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s spokesman said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> met separately in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> with the newly inaugurated president, <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Arena </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> founded by <PERSON> D'Aubuisson </PERSON>, and various political and military leaders. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> pulled <PERSON> D'Aubuisson </PERSON> aside, said press secretary <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckwith </PERSON>, and told him `` do n't embarrass <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>.'' `` He meant, ` Do n't do anything to cause problems for the administration,''' <PERSON> Beckwith </PERSON> said, adding that <PERSON> D'Aubuisson </PERSON> nodded in response. `` It's pretty obvious'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was referring to the reputed ties of <PERSON> D'Aubuisson </PERSON> and the political party he founded and right-wing death squads believed responsible for thousands of deaths over the past decade. In light of the recent assassination of <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>'s top cabinet adviser, <PERSON> Beckwith </PERSON> said there are concerns that rightists might try to retaliate. `` Quayle's been pretty solid that nothing of that sort should be done,'' <PERSON> Beckwith </PERSON> told reporters traveling with <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> as the vice president flew from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, to conclude a three-day swing through central <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> which he has called a `` mission of peace and democracy.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> also met with leftist leaders <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ungo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ruben </PERSON> <PERSON> Zamora </PERSON>, who are closely allied with the guerrillas, and told them the rebels should lay down their arms. `` They refused,'' <PERSON> Beckwith </PERSON> said. The vice president congratulated them for joining the democratic election process and urged them to cut their ties to the <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION>, the guerrilla organization. According to <PERSON> Beckwith </PERSON>, the two leaders admitted that the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> had been responsible for the recent assassination of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s attorney general, <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvadora </PERSON>, also an Arena member, and they suspected the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> was responsible for last Friday's shotgun slaying of cabinet adviser <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Porth </PERSON> However, the two leftists declined to sever relations with the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION>, stating that it represents a significant proportion of Salvadorans. In all his conversations, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> underscored the need to respect human rights. Critics in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> contend that even though <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> has pledged support for human rights, he is merely a front man for extremists who advocate use of torture, illegal detention and death squad killings in the decade-old fight against guerrillas. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> to end his trip by meeting with President <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>. The two were to discuss <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and the regional peace plan <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> authored, as well as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> concerns about the continuation in office of <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> ruler Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> Earlier Tuesday, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said it seems unlikely the Contras will return to live peacefully in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> but, after meeting with their leaders, he vowed continued <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for them. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> also accused <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> of trying `` to kill democracy'' in neighboring <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> by arming the leftist rebel movement. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> met with Contra military leader <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> and three top field commanders in <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, before flying to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> on the second day of his three-day Central American trip. He told reporters he informed the Contras he did not know what <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would do in terms of renewing military aid if the Nicaraguan elections next February are rigged. However, `` I said to them we continue to have and will always have a moral obligation to the resistance,'' he added. `` But until I know what's going to happen between now and the election and how that election is going to go I ca n't get more specific than that,'' he said. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is backing a regional diplomatic approach to solve the Nicaraguan war and supplying non-lethal aid to the 11,000-member Contra army until the elections are concluded. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have held out the possibility of renewed military aid if <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist Sandinista government does not hold a fair election. But <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and other officials acknowledge there is little sentiment in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for such a move. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> also visited <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>' widow and later told a news conference: `` That type of violence was perpetrated by the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> and the leftist guerrillas can not be tolerated.'' The <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> house, in a luxurious neighborhood where security-conscious residents live in walled compounds, was adorned with a black ribbon and a sign reading, `` We are in mourning and we reject terrorism.'' Bloodstains were visible on the driveway as soldiers cordoned off the street and dozens of <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agents stood at thle also viewed ult rifles, anti-tank rockets and other weapons the Salvadoran military said it captured from the rebels. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s staff released a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> statement saying the weaponry was of East-bloc and Cuban manufacture and blamed <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> as the principal facilitators of arms shipments to the rebels. The administration accuses the Sandinistaating the regional <LOCATION> Esquipulas </LOCATION> II peace accords' ban on export of revolution. In light of that, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said he is skeptical that the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> will live up to their fair-election promise. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said the Contra commanders he saw, whose noms de guerre were <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Vlos </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ganso </PERSON>, indicated they would not return peacefully to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> because they feared for their safety. The vice president said he did not urge the Contras to return home but encouraged them to `` try to use the political process that is available to them.'' But the commanders told him it would be `` a miracle'' tsee a fair <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> election, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. He said the Contras promised they were honoring the ban on military attacks that is a condition of the $ 49 million in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has allotted them until the election.

<HEAD>AIDS Patient Suing Doctors For Failing To Disclose Test Result</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROANOKE, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A malpractice lawsuit accuses two doctors of failing to tell a man he had tested positive for AIDS, and the plaintiff's lawyer said Tuesday the lawsuit is one of the first of its kind in the country. <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON>, a former tire salesman who is divorced, said he had sex with at least 14 women without using a condom before he learned last August that he had the disease. `` If I knew then what I know now, I would have been abstinent,'' <PERSON> Long </PERSON> said. `` I would never dream of passing ths virus on.'' <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Labowitz </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION> attorney who represents Long, said there have not been very many AIDS-related malpractice cases. `` There are about a dozen nationwide and most of them have to do with, oddly enough, false positives, people who have been told that they did have AIDS when they did not,'' he said. Long, 39, says he requested the test for acquired immune deficiency syndrome in February 1987 while he was being treated for kidney stones at <LOCATION> Roanoke </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> because he had been given blood transfusions in 1980. Long said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Basile </PERSON>, the internist who ordered the AIDS test, told him he would contact him if it was positive and <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cutter </PERSON>, the urologist who admitted him to the hospital, knew the test had been performed. Long alleges he never heard from either doctor. In court papers filed last month, <PERSON> Basile </PERSON> denied all allegations of negligence but acknowledged ordering the HIV test without providing counseling for Long. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Jessee </PERSON>, an attorney for Cutter, said his client `` denies that he was negligent or that anything he did harmed Mr. <PERSON> Long </PERSON> in any way.'' <PERSON> Labowitz </PERSON> said Long learned he had contracted AIDS, apparently from the transfusions, when he was admitted with symptoms of the disease, including swollen glands and lethargy. The lawyer said Long is taking medication and his AIDS symptoms come and go. `` He's healthier now than he has been,'' he said. Long contends that the doctors' failure to tell him the test result kept him from getting treatment that could prolong his life. `` It's a myth that AIDS is untreatable and there's nothing you can do,'' <PERSON> Labowitz </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Labowitz </PERSON> said Long has told the women and his former wife that he has AIDS. The lawyer said the women also might have grounds for a lawsuit.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Soviet Jewry voted Tuesday to support trade concessions to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> if President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> receives assurances that positive Soviet emigration trends will continue. `` The atmosphere is improving, but there is much yet to be done,'' said <PERSON> Shoshana </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardin </PERSON>, the chairman of the congress. `` There are still major impediments to emigration.'' The board of governors of the congress, which represents 47 Jewish organizations around the country, voted 48-3, with one abstention, to endorse a 12-month waiver of Jackson-Vannik amendment restrictions contingent on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> receiving assurances from the Kremlin. Although the language of the resolution was mild, it was significant because the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewry </ORGANIZATION> is a major interest group monitoring emigration from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The Jackson-Vanik amendment, passed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1974 under the sponsorship of the late Sen. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, D-Wash., and Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Vanik </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, now retired, requires the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> to allow a certain number of Jews to emigrate each year in return for most-favored-nation status, under which Soviet exports are subject to reduced tariffs in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> The legislation does not spell out levels of emigration, but allows the president some leeway in determining what is acceptable. Soviet leaders have bridled at the law, which they consider interference in their domestic affairs. Ms. <PERSON> Cardin </PERSON> predicted at a news conference that Jewish emigration from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> could reach 54,000 this year, up from 18,965 last year. The previous high level was 51,320 in 1979 and the low, since <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> passed the Jackson-Vanik amendment, was 896 in 1984. The resolution passed Tuesday said that `` the Soviet reform process is in a self-described state of definition and experimentation. The U.S.S.R. today is suspended between the oppression of its past and the promise of the future. The extension of new freedoms and democratic reforms coexist with old patterns of behavior and authority.'' It said that the organization was `` prepared to support a waiver of the Jackson-Vanik Amendment'' if the president receives assurances on four points: That current levels of emigration will be maintained; that those seeking to emigrate not be blocked because they had access to alleged ` state secrets'; that the cases of long-term refuseniks be resolved, and that Soviet authorities ease restrictions on so-called ` poor relatives.''' Ms. <PERSON> Cardin </PERSON>, who is from <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, said that her group knew of 200 families being denied permission to emigrate because they were `` poor relatives,'' requiring signed statements from kin that they have no outstanding financial obligations. She said that some 400,000 invitations have been mailed to Soviet Jews to leave the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, but that not all of those people had filed for permission to emigrate. Under Soviet law, those seeking a visa to emigrate must have permission from a relative in the country where they are seeking to travel. Ms. <PERSON> Cardin </PERSON> went to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in May and said she was told by Soviet officials that they were drafting legislation that would ease emigration, in part by not requiring the invitations to be sent by relatives. She said there was no guarantee when the law would be passed.

<TEXT>
 The number of victims suffering from food poisoning blamed on hazelnut-flavored yogurt rose to 14 and spread over a wider geographical area, authorities said Tuesday. Four new confirmed cases of botulism were reported, with two of the victims coming from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION>. Ten previously reported cases were confined to <LOCATION> Lancashire </LOCATION> in northwest <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. Most victims were hospitalized, some in serious condition. Botulism is a virulent form of food poisoning, disseminated through the bloodstream, which attacks the nerves in the head. It causes paralysis of the eyes and throat and difficulties in breathing and swallowing. Authorities were checking 10 dairies which received hazelnut puree from a company in <LOCATION> Folkestone </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kent </LOCATION>, athough Health Secretary <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON> stressed: `` No blame is yet established on anyone.'' <LOCATION> Blackpool </LOCATION>'s director of public health, <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>, said other cases could emerge. He set up an incident center to monitor the outbreak. The Department of Health warned people not to eat hazelnut yogurt for the time being. Supermarkets cleared shelves of it and destroyed stocks. `` At this stage, we do not know precisely what has caused this particular outbreak associated with hazelnut products connected with one firm in <LOCATION> Folkestone </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION>.

 Former state Attorney General <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> narrowly defeated former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Trible </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> on Tuesday in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s first Republican primary for governor in 40 years. <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> will oppose <PERSON> Democrat </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>, who is trying to become the first elected black governor of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> state. <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> lost in a previous bid for governor in 1981. With 2,006 of the state's 2,008 precincts reporting in unofficial returns, <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> had 147,538 votes to 139,967 for <PERSON> Trible </PERSON>, or 37 percent to 35 percent. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Stanford </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Parris </PERSON> trailed with 112,111 votes, or 28 percent. A joyous <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> appeared before his supporters at 9:40 p.m., saying, `` With your work and commitment, we're going to take back the statehouse in 1990.'' <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> said he appreciated `` the warmth and graciousness and eloquence of my two worthy adversaries. These two men were the toughest adversaries a person could have.'' <PERSON> Trible </PERSON>, who had been favored in the primary, conceded at 9:25 p.m. `` I've always believed in the fundamental fairness and wisdom of the people of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Trible </PERSON> told supporters in downtown <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>. `` Tonight, in their wisdom, the people of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> have chosen another _ <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>.'' The primary generated little public interest despite $ 10 million in campaign spending. Voter turnout approached 400,000, much greater than the 235,000 turnout for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION>'s Super Tuesday presidential primary last year. None of the candidates played up the racial aspect of a possible victory by <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>, the 58-year-old Democratic lieutenant governor. By contrast, charges of racism marked a mayoral campaign that culminated Tuesday in <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Cunningham </PERSON> lost a bid to become the city's first black mayor. Former Mayor <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> McCann </PERSON> defeated <PERSON> Cunningham </PERSON> by a margin of 30,169 to 24,249. Turnout was extremely light. <PERSON> McCann </PERSON>, 39, denied in the campaign that his supporters showed white voters a 1970s photograph of <PERSON> Cunningham </PERSON> wearing his hair in an Afro style. <PERSON> Cunningham </PERSON>, now a 43-year-old police captain, was accused of attack advertising for trying during his campaign to portray <PERSON> McCann </PERSON>, a wealthy accountant, as anti-tenant and pro-developer.

 Why do actors act, singers sing or comedians crack jokes? `` Showing Off'' is the answer reiterated by four performers in the title song of a chirpy, cheery little musical revue now playing at a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION> cabaret room called <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> McGraw </PERSON>'s. They call this self-absorption `` art for artist's sake.'' Musical revues are an endangered species in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> these days, and good ones are near extinction. The long-running and forever-changing `` Forbidden Broadway'' cornered the market on spoofs of Broadway musicals. `` Showing Off,'' written by <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON> and <PERSON> Denis </PERSON> <PERSON> Markell </PERSON>, takes a much wider aim and more often than not scores a bull's Its best songs are sly, satiric numbers with just a touch of spite that capture the intense peculiarities of big city residents. In one, <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON> and <PERSON> Markell </PERSON> poke fun at SIP, Self Important People. You know, the folks that work in theater box offices, maitres d' at fancy French restaurants, auto mechanics, or telephone receptionists whose first words are `` Hold, please.'' In another, <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON>, who appears in the show with <ORGANIZATION> Veanne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cox </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>, plays the Showbiz Rabbi. He leads the Temple for the Performing Arts in _ where else _ <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. At his congregation, you can `` atone by phone'' by calling a toll-free number. In `` Rental Cruelty,'' a husband and wife do n't fight about co-op or condo prices, but battle about her addiction to renting videocassettes. `` Documentaries,'' he sobs. `` You're back on the hard stuff.'' <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON> is a sleepy bear of a man with a lazy, laid-back charm. <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> suggests a world-weary yuppie who lost it all in the stock market crash. Miss <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> is a sexy Olive Oyl crossed with a Kewpie doll, while Miss <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> smolders with a smoky voice and a deadly funny, deadpan manner. `` Showing Off'' demands a little intelligence from its audience. It helps going into the show to know something about such diverse subjects as <PERSON> Eudora </PERSON> <PERSON> Welty </PERSON>, `` Blue Velvet,'' `` Eraserhead'' and <PERSON> Michele </PERSON> <PERSON> Marsh </PERSON>, an anchorwoman for the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> affiliate in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Director <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Leeds </PERSON> does n't allow the pace to sag during the 75-minute show, moving performers on and off the small stage with rapid-fire precision. Pianist <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Flaherty </PERSON> provides strong, unobtrusive support, the hallmark of a fine musician. `` Showing Off'' proves that such musical entertainments as the revue can be resusciated. But it takes a special kind of writing and performance to make it consistently appealing. This lively and literate show does n't falter during its parade of funny business.

<HEAD>Actress Unhappy With Pending Release Of Assailant</HEAD>

 The state parole board decided Tuesday that the deranged fan who knifed <PERSON> Theresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Saldana </PERSON> in 1982 wo n't be released until March, but the actress said she ca n't understand why he would ever be freed. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, earlier given a good-behavior parole date of Thursday that had halved his 12-year sentence for attempted murder, must now serve an additional 270 days for breaking prison windows and refusing to obey orders, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> parole officials decided. His pending release had spurred moves in the state <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> to lengthen the sentence for second-degree murder and brought an outraged response from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> city officials. New charges filed in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> last week accuse <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> of sending threatening letters from his prison cell, but the board did n't rescind the good-time credits allowing <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> an early release. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, a 53-year-old Scottish drifter, attacked the actress from `` Raging Bull'' outside her <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> apartment and stabbed her 10 times with a kitchen knife. `` I am temporarily relieved and I'm glad we can have the baby and not be worried about a release date around the time of my baby due date. I will be able to have my baby in peace,'' said the actress, who is 6 months pregnant. But she expressed dismay that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> could eventually be freed. `` It's very confusing. Everyone tells me, ` Just have him committed.' Everyone feels that will be the solution.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> attorney <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shore </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> said he may appeal the decision, handed down after a closed disciplinary hearing by the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Terms </ORGANIZATION> at the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Medical Facility in <LOCATION> Vacaville </LOCATION>. The prison's chief psychiatrist, <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Meenakshi </PERSON>, told reporters afterward that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has been diagnosed a chronic paranoid schizophrenic who lives in his own world. `` If you look at it in the way the courts look at it legally, then no, he's not dangerous in legal terms,'' she said. `` To people he is involved with in his delusional mind, he is dangerous.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s new parole date is March 15, 1990. The board also added two conditions of parole: He can not contact the actress and can not return to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> without written approval. Last week, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> prosecutors filed eight felony counts against <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> for allegedly making death threats against <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Saldana </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> District Attorney <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Reiner </PERSON> wanted the board to enforce the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s full 12-year sentence. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> could face eight more years in prison and possible deportation if convicted on the latest charges. `` Our objective, quite simply, is to keep him off the street,'' <PERSON> Reiner </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Museum Displays Vase Restored for Third Time</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The British Museum placed the <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vase </LOCATION> in a guarded, bulletproof display case Tuesday, a year after the 2,000-year-old Roman treasure was deliberately smashed again and reassembled with modern glue. The vase, estimated to be worth $ 18 million, had been broken two times before and was restored a third time because the glue holding it together had become yellow and brittle. <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, the museum's chief conservator of ceramics, said the blue and white cameo-glass vase `` now at last is restored to its former glory.'' He said the latest epoxy resins were used in the restoration. In 1845, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON>, who had been drinking heavily for a week, smashed the vase into about 200 pieces with his walking stick when it was displayed at the museum. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON>, an Irishman, had a grudge against relatives of then Prime Minister, the Duke of <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, whose family had owned the vase since 1785. It was stuck together by the British Museum's craftsmen and put on display. But the glue became so weak and discolored that in 1948 it was dismantled and rebuilt. Last year it was broken again and reassembled. The vase was made by the sculptor <PERSON> Dioscourides </PERSON> and depicts men and women in a leafy setting _ probably the courtship of <LOCATION> Peleus </LOCATION> and the sea goddess <PERSON> Thetis </PERSON>, who became the parents of the mythical Greek warrior Achilles. It was discovered in 1582 in a tomb near <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> and is believed to have belonged to the Emperor <PERSON> Augustus </PERSON>.

<HEAD>House Votes $127 Million to Beleagured D.C. Police</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, responding to a drug-driven record murder rate in the nation's capital, voted Tuesday to spend $ 127 million to hire 700 additional <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> police officers. The bill, which passed by a 289-104 margin, authorizes spending the money over five years to bring extra force to a police department that now has slightly more than 3,900 members. `` This bill will bring peace and stability to neighborhoods that have erupted in an outbreak of drug-related violence,'' said Del. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-D.C. </LOCATION>, chief sponsor the measure. The measure is awaiting action in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would still have to appropriate the money each year to allow it to be spent. Through Tuesday, 202 people had been killed in the district so far in 1989, compared to 133 at the same time last year. A record 372 persons were killed in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in 1988, and police blamed more than 60 percent of these killings on drugs. Although opponents said the bill would be a costly special special stipend for one city, backers won with arguments that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has ultimate responsibility for safety in the nation's capital `` I find it almost uncanny that members can on the one hand begin to be seriously concerned about the health and safety of residents of the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, but when we begin to address that issue, the issue suddenly becomes numbers,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Dellums </PERSON>, D-Calif., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> The bill also directs the city to begin construction on a new 800-bed prison and drug treatment facility in southeast <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, and establish a community relations plan by assigning the officers to regular neighborhood beats. The measure also stipulates that all assets seized in drug raids be turned over to the police department for use in anti-drug programs. Mayor <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>, whose contacts with a convicted drug dealer are the subject of a federal grand jury probe and criticism on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, said the House action demonstrates that the city still has a good rapport with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` We are very pleased with the outcome,'' <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> said. `` It shows that our relationship with the <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> is still intact.'' <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is also considering a proposal to assign officers from federal police agencies to the city police department while the 700 additional officers are recruited and trained.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Aguilar </PERSON> was indicted Tuesday on charges that he illegally aided felons, making him the first federal judge charged with violating <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> racketeering laws. Also indicted by the federal grand jury were <PERSON> Abe </PERSON> `` The Trigger'' <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>, a self-styled former Mafia hitman and longtime acquaintance of <PERSON> Aguilar </PERSON>'s, and <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Tham </PERSON>, a convicted embezzler for whom <PERSON> Aguilar </PERSON> allegedly interceded. If convicted of all charges in the eight-count indictment, <PERSON> Aguilar </PERSON>, 58, could be sentenced to 55 years in prison and fined $ 2 million. The indictment obtained by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> accuses <PERSON> Aguilar </PERSON> of going to other federal judges and trying to get favorable treatment for <PERSON> Tham </PERSON> and another felon, <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Cloud </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> casino owner who was convicted of bank fraud. <PERSON> Aguilar </PERSON> has disclosed in financial statements that he accepted an interest-free, lifetime $ 12,000 loan from Cloud. The judge is also accused of tipping off <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> about a federal wiretap order; advising one of <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>'s lawyers to lie to the grand jury about <PERSON> Aguilar </PERSON>'s activities; making false statements to the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>; and helping his former secretary, attorney <PERSON> Vera </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoff </PERSON>, while she was a fugitive in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, where she fled after a tax conviction. <PERSON> Aguilar </PERSON>, a 1980 appointee of President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, is the first federal judge charged with racketeering and the fourth to be accused of crimes in the last decade. Unlike most cases brought under the federal racketeering law, <PERSON> Aguilar </PERSON> is not accused of benefiting financially from his activities. Instead, the indictment contends the judge used his $ 89,500-a-year job as a racketeering `` enterprise'' in multiple acts of `` corruptly endeavoring to obstruct, impede, and influence the due administration of justice.'' <PERSON> Aguilar </PERSON> declined to talk to reporters who went to his home in <LOCATION> Campbell </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> after the indictment, and attempts by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> to obtain his telephone number were unsuccessful. Talking to reporters before the long-expected indictment, <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Hallinan </PERSON>, a lawyer for <PERSON> Aguilar </PERSON>, called the accusations `` hogwash'' and contended the judge was being targeted as a minority liberal who has issued several important rulings against the government. Federal prosecutors sought the indictment because `` they do n't like the viewpoint of one judge,'' <PERSON> Hallinan </PERSON> said The indictment was issued after <PERSON> Mrs. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoff </PERSON>, who was arrested in March, agreed to testify against <PERSON> Aguilar </PERSON> in a plea bargain with the government. <PERSON> Aguilar </PERSON>'s former secretary broke down in tears while testifying Tuesday afternoon, said her attorney, <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Hoff </PERSON> was promised no additional time for absconding, and a parole hearing in September regarding her two-year prison sentence, her lawyer said. Violations of a federal law called the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO, are punishable by up to 20 years in prison. <PERSON> Hallinan </PERSON> said <PERSON> Aguilar </PERSON> has arranged to turn himself in on July 12 or 13. He said he has asked the judge to take a leave from his job in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> federal court while the charges are pending, though not to resign from office; a federal judge can be removed only through impeachment by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> became the first judge this century to be impeached in 1986, two years after he was convicted of income tax evasion. Impeachment is pending against two other federal judges, <PERSON> Alcee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, over allegations stemming from his acquittal on bribery charges, and <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, who was convicted of perjury. The RICO law, passed in 1970, prohibits conducting an `` enterprise'' in a pattern of criminal activity, consisting of at least two specified crimes in a 10-year period. The crimes range from murder and kidnapping to mail fraud, obstruction of justice and interference with criminal investigations. The law was aimed at fighting organized crime but has been interpreted broadly to apply to a variety of ongoing criminal activity, including the misuse of a government position such as police officer or state judge for personal benefit.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> approved ground-breaking legislation Tuesday that would give a new tax credit of up to $ 500 a year to low-income working Americans to help them buy health insurance for their children. The provision was part of a larger measure crafted by committee chairman <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, that also would enable the working poor to take fuller advantage of tax credits for child care already available to everyone. Democratic leaders are contemplating having the measure debated this week on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor. It is certain to produce sparks not only because of the innovative new health tax credit, but also because it takes a more modest approach to child care benefits than another major Democratic initiative, yet differs significantly from yet another child care program proposed by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The 17-3 vote by which the measure cleared committee was not a true measure of its overall support even among committee members. Several Republicans who voted for it said they had serious reservations and were acting largely to spur consideration of child care legislation. `` I know there is going to be a big battle with the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> bill on the floor,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., a committee member and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> leader `` Maybe we'll end up without any child care bill at all.'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s reference to the `` ABC'' bill was to a measure by Sen. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Conn </LOCATION>., that envisions a much more expensive child care program and one that generates additional controversy because it would impose national standards on day-care providers The <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> legislation aims at providing about $ 10.5 billion in additional benefits over a five-year period without increasing the federal budget deficit. It would raise the money by keeping the existing 3 percent telephone excise tax in place indefinitely rather than allowing it to expire after Dec. 31, 1990 under current law. The measure also would delay for one year the imposition of so-called Section 89 of the tax code governing tax deductions for employer-paid health insurance and simplify the rules once they do take effect. Although having little direct impact on individuals, the Section 89 provisions have generated a huge outcry from businesses complaining largely about the complexity of compliance. The rules are intended to discourage richer health insurance policies for executives than for rank-and-file workers by prohibiting bigger tax breaks for such executive plans. The new rules would simply record-keeping procedures and clarify eligibility tests for what would constitute impermissibly subsidized policies. Although some members expressed skepticism that the health insurance tax credit would help much, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said he was encouraged by testimony before the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Monday by a <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> vice president who predicted the insurance industry would develop policies aimed directly at children if a new federal subsidy is made available to help pay for them. He said such policies are already available in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> for about $ 250 a year per child. The new tax credit would be up to 50 percent of the cost of a policy up to $ 1,000, resulting in a maximum of $ 500 for a family with $ 12,000 or less income. The percentage decreases steadily until the credit would not be available for a family with more than $ 21,000 income. The policy would have to cover at least one dependent child under age 19, but also could cover other family members, including adults. `` Here we're trying to get at the working poor,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. The health tax credit would be `` refundable.'' That is, a family that qualifies for the tax credit, but does not make enough money to have to pay income tax, would get the benefit in the form of a cash grant. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s package also makes an existing tax credit refundable so poorer Americans would be able to claim the same benefit even if they do not incur an income tax liability. The current credit is up to 30 percent for child care costs up to $ 4,800 for a household with two or more eligible children or $ 2,400 for one child. The 30 percent credit is available only to households with income below $ 10,000 and falls by 1 percentage point for each $ 2,000 of adjusted gross income between $ 10,000 and $ 28,000. Above $ 28,000, the maximum credit is 20 percent. In addition to making the credit refundable, the <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> bill would increase the credit to 32 percent for taxpayers with income between $ 8,000 and $ 10,000 a year and to 34 percent for those making below $ 8,000 a year. In other words, a single mother working for the minimum wage and paying $ 40 a week for a babysitter would be eligible for a $ 980 tax credit _ in cash if necessary _ rather than the $ 624 deduction from taxes due under current law.

Remember the halcyon days of the <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> clan, when all three networks would set up in the two-acre yard behind `` the Hut,'' the family's fabulous <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION> mansion _ better known nowadays as the <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> _ to cover those fairytale birthday parties that famous comedian <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> -LRB- one half of <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> -RRB- would throw for his youngest son, <PERSON> Chris </PERSON>, who grew up to be semifamous as a regular on `` Late Night With <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON>''? Did any of us realize that those were all <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON>'s friends? Did any of us really think a 6-year-old would invite <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavett </PERSON> to his birthday party? Or <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Vale </PERSON>? Or <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rooney </PERSON> and <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuralt </PERSON> _ who wrestled shirtless, for <PERSON> Pete </PERSON>'s sake? Well, it seems that after long years of painful self-examination, <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> has finally found the courage to write the book that explodes the myth _ `` Daddy's Boy.'' It makes `` Mommie Dearest'' _ and <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>'s `` Damn You, Daddy Dearest'' _ look like love letters! What a shock to find out that <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> was so egomaniacal, he named his sons <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 1 through 9 _ except the twins, who were 5A and 5B. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON>, the 10th son, was even forced to wear a latex `` bald'' wig so he would look more like his father. `` <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> <PERSON> Preminger </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Chris </PERSON>' heartless classmates called him. `` How could I make people listen to me?'' <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> writes searchingly in his opening chapter. `` How could I tell the story that so desperately needed telling, and maybe make a few bucks in the process, and then it hit me like a ton of bricks. Write a book! ... `` But wait a second, was I nuts? Did I really have enough complaints about growing up to fill a book? I convinced myself that that did n't matter. The only important thing was that I get my face on the cover.'' What also mattered was the legal action <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> was sure to take when <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> let him have it in the tell-all book. To assuage the legal eagles, <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> gamely offered his father a rebuttal to each chapter. `` I do n't know what <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> is talking about,'' <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> complains in his rebuttal to Chapter 1 of `` Daddy's Boy'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Delacorte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, $ 12.95 -RRB-. `` <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> does n't have nine brothers. He has three sisters and one brother. We did not live in the <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION>, and I have never in my life had the pleasure of meeting Mr. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Vale </PERSON>, although I would not turn down such an opportunity if it presented itself. Do my lawyers actually think people are going to take this book seriously?''

 Elsewhere in television: BUSH'S FIRST 100 DAYS ON TELEVISION _ Media Monitor, a research publication of the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, says <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> was tougher on President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> during his first 100 days in office than NBC or <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>. A study by the non-profit media research group found <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> received favorable personal evaluations, but his policies were assessed positively only 39 percent of the time on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, compared to 63 percent favorable on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> gave <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> 85 percent positive evaluations, according to the analysis. Whether negative or positive, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is getting less coverage than his predecessors, according to the study.

<HEAD>``P-Star'' May Shed New Light on Economy</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: John Cunniff is on vacation</HEAD>

 Bored by humdrum economic statistics like the unemployment rate, housing starts and quarterly estimates of the seasonally adjusted annual growth rate of the real gross national product? Well, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> has something new to spice up your study of economics _ the mysterious forces that help determine the size of your paycheck and make everything you want to buy too expensive. It's called P-star, after the symbol _ P with an asterisk _ used in the mathematical equations by which it is computed. The P stands for the level of prices everybody pays for goods and services. The asterisk means, roughly, `` not the current level of prices, but the natural-long term level where they would stand depending on the amount of money flowing through the economy.'' In other words, it is an experimental tool for measuring and managing future inflationary trends. That makes it potentially important because the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> bases its decisions about whether to stimulate the economy by lowering interest rates, or to slow it down by making credit more expensive, largely on where it believes the inflation rate is headed. Traders in the financial markets also help to set interest rates by buying or selling bonds based on their inflation expectations and on what they believe the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> will do next. So if the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> deems P-star significant and useful, Fed-watchers will watch it too, and it someday could make a difference in whether you can afford a mortgage or how much interest you can get on a certificate of deposit. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman, described P-star several months ago in testimony before a congressional committee. He said research by the central bank's staff `` indicates that future changes in the rate of inflation have been fairly reliably linked to the difference between the prevailing price level -LRB- P without a star -RRB- and its equilibrium level -LRB- P-star -RRB-.'' When actual prices stand below P-star, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s studies suggest, inflation seems likely to increase at some point in the future. When actual prices are above P-star, conversely, a slowing of inflation can be expected somewhere down the road. Calculated for recent three-month periods, actual prices have been below P-star, suggesting increasing inflationary pressures. But the gap has been narrowing, and there is talk that the figures may soon point to lower, rather than higher, inflation in the future. However, private economists warn against putting too much weight on this nascent number. `` First, this is a long-run indicator and is not meant to be used for short-run adjustments to monetary policy,'' said <PERSON> Darwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Beck </PERSON> at the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` Second, there is a long lag between when P-star points to a deceleration of inflation and when that deceleration begins to show up in actual price changes. In most cases this lag is a year or more. `` Short-run monetary policy will not be influenced by this indicator.'' Skeptics say the idea of P-star itself is questionable because the formula used to calculate it requires making some dubious assumptions _ giving stable values to some aspects of the economy that are inherently unstable and unpredictable. `` It's certainly too early to tell just what if any role this new analysis will have in the policy process,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Resler </PERSON>, chief economist at <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` If it is given prominence, <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> policymakers could find themselves exposed to criticism about the underlying assumptions that determine P-star.''

<HEAD>Morris Udall: Ravaged by Disease, but Still Tough</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: CORRECTS spelling of Goldwater's name in 2nd graf: Note 3rd

<TEXT>
 In the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> hearing room hangs a portrait of Chairman <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Udall </PERSON>, standing tall with his coat slung over his shoulder. The longtime lawmaker, former presidential candidate and well-known humorist appears eager for a challenge. But the man occupying the chairman's seat across the room no longer mirrors his portrait. He sits stooped in his chair, his hands quivering and his voice barely audible. Although physically ravaged by <PERSON> Parkinson </PERSON>'s disease, <PERSON> Udall </PERSON>, 67 years old today, fends off calls for his retirement and still gets his message through clearly. `` My replacement has n't been born yet,'' <PERSON> Udall </PERSON> recently told Rep. <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Nighthorse </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, D-Colo., who had the temerity to ask his fellow Democrat whether he'd been grooming anyone to take over the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> seat from <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> he's held since 1960 `` He's as tough as in the portrait,'' says Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ariz </LOCATION>., whose district neighbors <PERSON> Udall </PERSON>'s `` His mind is still very sharp,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, the committee's ranking Republican. `` We've been fighting for 14 or 15 years. I've beat him two or three times, but it's very difficult.'' <PERSON> Udall </PERSON>, who once played a year of pro basketball despite having a glass eye and unsuccessfully sought his party's presidential nomination in 1976, has taken the disease as a challenge and, his staff says, is fighting it with a sense of humor. There's never been any doubt about that sense of humor. One of the jokes aides like to repeat was used by <PERSON> Udall </PERSON> back when news was circulating about <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Parkinson </PERSON>, a shapely lobbyist whose kiss-and-tell habit had many members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> nervous. `` There are two kinds of Parkinson's disease,'' said <PERSON> Udall </PERSON>. `` Both of them give you the shakes.'' Although <PERSON> Udall </PERSON>, a liberal, says he does n't use an iron hand to rule the committee, which oversees government lands, it's easy to see that legislation he opposes does n't stand a chance. Republicans stalked out of a committee session one day in May when their amendments to the Udall-sponsored American Heritage Trust Act were defeated by Democratic proxies held by <PERSON> Udall </PERSON>. `` My style is different,'' he said in a recent interview. He uses `` the merits'' to argue his position, he said dryly. Pausing, he said, `` I jest.'' Then, with the sagacity for which he is known, <PERSON> Udall </PERSON> defined power in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> as `` the ability for me to have you vote ` aye' when you want to vote ` no.' `` It may be because of a favor from the past, because you like me or because I gave time to the opposition,'' he said. <PERSON> Udall </PERSON> was hospitalized last month to have his Parkinson's medication adjusted and for treatment of pneumonia An old friend, <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>, wrote a column for The <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> suggesting that <PERSON> Udall </PERSON> retire. `` It hurt him,'' said <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>, former <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> bureau chief for the Republic, retired and living in suburban <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. `` I'm sorry for that.'' But <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said he sticks by his column. `` You ca n't ask people to stay young forever,'' he said, adding that he fears people will start taking advantage of <PERSON> Udall </PERSON> because of his health. Committee colleagues from both parties support <PERSON> Udall </PERSON>'s decision to stay. `` We owe him,'' said <PERSON> Young </PERSON>. `` Even though we are adversaries on many issues -LRB- and -RRB- our philosophies are different, ... I respect him very much.'' Another frequent adversary on the committee, Rep. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Marlenee </PERSON>, R-Mont., said he would `` support Mr. <PERSON> Udall </PERSON> for as long as he chooses to come to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> I have the greatest respect for him.'' Former <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON>, mentioned by <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> as someone who knew when it was time to pass the burden to younger shoulders, wrote <PERSON> Udall </PERSON> after the column was published. `` Your fellow Arizonans are sitting out here, reading that everybody in the Land of Oz is urging you to step down and come home,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> said. `` I hope to God you do what you want to do, to hell with these advisors that want you to come back. I'd love to have you in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, with me, -LRB- but -RRB- to be honest with you, I'd rather have you in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> doing the things you do for our state.'' When he was released from the hospital May 26, <PERSON> Udall </PERSON>'s doctors told him to rest for a week or two. Five days later, he was back in his office. `` He keeps very active, which is very important,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parkinson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, of which <PERSON> Udall </PERSON> is honorary chairman. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> acknowledged that at times <PERSON> Udall </PERSON> looks bad, but said <PERSON> Parkinson </PERSON>'s patients have intact mental abilities. `` They do not lose their faculties,'' he said. `` They watch their body deteriorate day after day.'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said some people function for 25 to 30 years with the disease. <PERSON> Udall </PERSON> has battled it for about 10. He also suffers from arthritis, said an aide, which accounts for his stoop. Parkinson's is a neurological disorder that affects automatic movements, forcing sufferers to concentrate on muscle reactions normal people have without thinking. Another symptom is loss of voice, said <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>. Despite that handicap, <PERSON> Udall </PERSON> speaks to other Parkinson's patients at functions arranged by the association. `` He's an inspiration because he has n't given up,'' said <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>. Many do n't want him to. Most bluntly, <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON> gave <PERSON> Udall </PERSON> this advice on detractors: `` Tell them to go to hell.''

 A handsome, obsessed young man in ascot and smoking jacket pensively paces the vast rooms of his ancestral manor, as clouds scud across the moon on a brooding night. He muses: `` Criminals are a superstitious, cowardly lot, so my disguise must be able to strike terror in their hearts! ... Must be a creature of the night, black, terrible ...'' CRASH! The windows open, and a huge bat flies into the room. An omen! `` That's it,'' he exults. `` I shall become a bat!!!'' A half-century ago, <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> donned gray tights, blue-black cape and bat-eared cowl to go forth in the dark of night in <LOCATION> Gotham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to fight crime as <PERSON> Batman </PERSON>. Today, as a $ 40 million movie, he ranks with such great fictional detectives as <PERSON> Sherlock </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> and the Lone Ranger. He began 50 years ago in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. `` Superman'' had been around for a year. Eighteen-year-old <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> was asked by <ORGANIZATION> DC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Comics </ORGANIZATION> editor <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> to devise a new character to meet the demand for more superheroes. `` I remember,'' <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> said in an interview, `` when I was 12 or 13 I was an ardent reader of books on how things began _ the automobile, the steam engine, the parachute _ and I came across a book about <PERSON> Leonardo </PERSON> <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Vinci </PERSON>. This had a picture of a flying machine with huge bat wings. ... It looked like a bat man to me.'' He also remembered the 1920 movie `` The Mark of Zorro,'' starring <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Fairbanks </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON> `` During the day he was a bored count, a philanthropist,'' <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> said. `` But he became Zorro at night. He donned this mask and came out of a cave riding a black horse.'' And there was a somber 1930 movie, `` The Bat Whispers,'' starring <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> as a costumed villain who wore a full-face bat mask. <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> also was inspired by radio and pulp novel heroes such as `` wealthy man-about-town LaMont <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>'' who by night became The Shadow, a grim avenger, and news publisher <PERSON> Britt </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON>, who became the crime-fighting Green Hornet. `` I know it sounds like I'm copying, but everyone saw what I saw,'' <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> said. `` I was reinterpreting. It was my vision, my interpretation.'' So within a weekend, the <PERSON> Batman </PERSON> was born.

 It is night in <LOCATION> Gotham </LOCATION>, a city of looming shadows, expressionist architecture, gutters and grinning gargoyles. Six-year-old <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> is walking home from the movies -LRB- `` The Mark of Zorro,'' some say -RRB- with his parents, <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> and Dr. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON>. A robber steps from the shadows, an automatic in his hand. A struggle! He shoots Dr. and Mrs. <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> to death as the little boy watches. The gunman flees. The little boy sobs over the bodies of his parents.

 `` The minute that <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> and <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> died, <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> stopped living,'' said <PERSON> Denny </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>, the Batman writer-editor at <ORGANIZATION> DC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Comics </ORGANIZATION>. `` Maybe he did n't know he was <PERSON> Batman </PERSON>, but he became the remorseless avenger.'' The boy grows up. He studies `` scientific crime detection,'' acrobatics and martial arts. He makes himself a supreme instrument of justice: a fighter, a forensic scientist, an escape artist who rivals <PERSON> Houdini </PERSON>, a master of disguise. `` The things he's about are obsession and human perfectablity, which makes him unique among the pantheon of superheroes,'' <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> said. `` It's about urban fears. It's about what's happened to cities in the last 100 years.'' <LOCATION> Gotham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> explained, is an important character in the Batman saga. `` <LOCATION> Gotham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> is this dramatic, brooding, claustrophobic place where anytime you turn the corner, something bad can happen,'' he said. <PERSON> Robin </PERSON>, the Boy Wonder, joined <PERSON> Batman </PERSON> in April 1940. His name was derived from <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hood </PERSON>, another righter of wrongs, and so were his red tunic and green boots. `` You can argue that he was an essential element of <PERSON> Batman </PERSON>'s popularity because he counters all the grimness,'' <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> said `` It's also very useful for the grim avenger to have somebody to talk to, so we can have what we writers call exposition.'' <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> was <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Grayson </PERSON>, the son of circus trapeze artists who saw his parents fall to their deaths, slain by mobsters. <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> took the young aerialist as his ward, and soon the wise-cracking young punster was a constant companion on the Caped Crusader's midnight patrols. `` <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> was for the kid reader to identify with, which kind of puzzled me,'' said the artist-writer <PERSON> Jules </PERSON> <PERSON> Feiffer </PERSON>. `` The role of the kid was to be adventurous; the role of the grownup was to save him.'' The'40s were a great time for the Dynamic Duo. When World War II struck, <PERSON> Batman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> fought at home against spies, fifth columnists, racketeers, profiteers, ration book counterfeiters. They also conquered such enduring psychopaths as The Penguin, Two-Face and The Joker. The Joker, played by <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicholson </PERSON> in the movie, is a grinning, green-haired, white-faced, leering `` Clown Prince of Crime'' whose features were altered permanently by an unfortunate chemical bath. He is utterly crazy. By the early'50s, some comic books were seriously nasty. Their stories of crime, horror and war curdled with violence, <PERSON> gore </PERSON> and bosomy babes in naughty clothes, serious bondage and bad relationships. Sen. <PERSON> Estes </PERSON> <PERSON> Keefauver </PERSON>'s 1955-56 subcommittee on juvenile delinquency and other anti-comics forces made the industry purge the sex and violence. <PERSON> Batman </PERSON> became a model citizen and role model. `` He became a kind of bright, sunny scoutmaster who would walk down the street and the people would say, ` Hi, <PERSON> Batman </PERSON>!''' <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> said. `` He was n't the kind of guy who would scare me.'' <PERSON> Batman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> traveled in time, went to other planets and fought crooks in huge amusement parks, futuristic playgrounds and vast arenas filled with oversized consumer goods. And <PERSON> Batman </PERSON>'s inventions _ the <LOCATION> Batmobile </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Batplane </PERSON>, Batcopter, the multipurpose <LOCATION> Batarang </LOCATION> and ever-useful Utility Belt _ overwhelmed the scary aspect of <PERSON> Batman </PERSON>'s character His forensic abilities -LRB- `` Great Scott! There's only one place where you can find jute threads in <LOCATION> Gotham </LOCATION> City!'' -RRB- were as sharp as ever, but the fearsome underside of the Batman's obsession was gone. <PERSON> Batman </PERSON> mutated into a beefy, genial, lantern-jawed crook-thumper who chuckled at <PERSON> Robin </PERSON>'s awful pun in the last panel.

 <LOCATION> NEW </LOCATION> <LOCATION> YORK </LOCATION>: last panel. In the'60s, Pop Art popped and <PERSON> Batman </PERSON> became camp. In 1966, <PERSON> Batman </PERSON> got a television series that starred the feckless <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> West </PERSON> as the Caped Crusader and <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> as <PERSON> Robin </PERSON>. The Dark Knight Detective went burlesque, a thick-headed straight man to made-for-TV villains whose schemes were thwarted in hilarious stunt-man combats interspered with `` THUD!'' `` POW!'' and `` SPLAT'' captions. By the early'70s, popular culture had left <PERSON> Batman </PERSON> behind. Places such as <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Kent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Altamont </LOCATION> had made <LOCATION> Gotham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> irrelevant. <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> returned the gothic element to the stories and <PERSON> Batman </PERSON> to the night. Artist <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> drew a lithe, muscular <PERSON> Batman </PERSON> with a cinematic realism that sizzled with pent-up energy. The evils <PERSON> Batman </PERSON> found were born out of social ills such as drug addiction, terrorism, racism, poverty _ and sometimes victory was impossible. The'80s saw <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> part company with <PERSON> Batman </PERSON>. He changed costume to become Nightwing and hang out with the young super-heroes known as The Teen Titans. <PERSON> Batman </PERSON> went his own way and adopted another <PERSON> Robin </PERSON>, a headstrong, unruly street kid named <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Todd </PERSON>. The new <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> was ill-received by <PERSON> Batman </PERSON>'s readers, who insisted by majority vote on a 900-number telephone poll that the new, unpopular <PERSON> Boy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wonder </PERSON> meet an untimely end. He did, blown up by the Joker. In 1986, the legend received a startling new vision with the so-called graphic novel: `` The Dark Knight Returns,'' by <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, a shy artist who wo n't give interviews. His Batman is 46 or so, retired from crime-fighting and much too old to be leaping around the crazed skyline of a <LOCATION> Gotham </LOCATION> that has sunk back into the ooze of corruption, greed and savage, random violence. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> is bored, depressed, drinking too much and still tormented by his parents' deaths and the vision of the bat He emerges from retirement and embarks on a bloody war against evil. <LOCATION> Gotham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> is still a character. So is The Joker. And so is <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> _ this time a 13-year-old girl named <PERSON> Carrie </PERSON>. `` The Dark Knight Returns'' is as violent and nasty as the bad old comics of yesteryear, but packaged as a trade paperback for adult readers. <PERSON> Feiffer </PERSON> calls <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s artistic vision `` graphically exciting but unpersuasive as fiction.'' <PERSON> Kane </PERSON>, who thinks <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> is a talented artist, does n't like the notion that <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> has a drinking problem in the book. However, he does credit <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> with helping to renew the Batman saga and making the movie possible. <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> was a consultant for the film, and his autobiography, `` Batman and Me,'' is due out in October. `` He adapts to each era,'' <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> said. `` He fights against all injustices in the world. He fights the battle for the little man. ... He rights the wrongs that they can not. `` He's their hero. He's everybody.''

 Return with us now to May 1939 and the Batman's debut in Detective Comics No 27. Our story opens as handsome, young socialite <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> chats with his old friend, Police Commissioner <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>. <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON>, his smartly tailored suit a lively orange window-pane plaid, asks if anything exciting is happening these days. `` No,'' <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> replies. `` Except this fellow they call the ` Bat-Man' puzzles me!'' Indeed! It seems a grim, costumed `` Bat-Man'' has taken up crime fighting. Always one step ahead of the police, he tosses thugs about like throw pillows. A bizarre series of burglary-murders ensues. The Batman investigates. Conflict! A struggle. The Caped Crusader is subdued! ... Trapped! Villain sneers: `` This is the gas chamber I use to kill guinea pigs. To experiment with _ but now YOU are my guinea pig -LRB- Heh! Heh! -RRB- When this glass lid covers you entirely, gas will come through the jet and kill you -LRB- Heh! Heh! -RRB-'' Victim comeback: `` You fiend.'' `` Bat-Man'' comment after slugging criminal mastermind to horrible plunging death in acid vat: `` A fitting end for his kind.'' <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> casually reappears for the denouement, and <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> reflects, `` <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> is a nice young chap _ but he certainly must lead a boring life. ... Seems disinterested in everything.'' Ha! The story ends as <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> `` returns home to his room ... a little later his door slowly opens ... and reveals its occupant. ... If the commissioner could see his young friend now ... he'd be amazed to learn that he is the ` Bat-Man!''' `` Watch for a new thrilling Bat-Man story next month.''

 So maybe there's not a Batman disposable diaper. Yet. But you can snag a Batman walkie-talkie, <PERSON> Batman </PERSON> trading cards, <PERSON> Batman </PERSON> pajamas and <PERSON> Batman </PERSON> underwear, a Batman lunch box _ with a <LOCATION> Batman </LOCATION> thermos _ and just about every strain of <PERSON> Batman </PERSON> kitsch imaginable. `` There's as much merchandise tied to this movie as any movie I've ever seen since ` Star Wars,''' said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Caplan </PERSON>, president of the marketing consulting firm <ORGANIZATION> Gary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caplan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` Batman is the hottest thing in T-shirts right now,'' said <PERSON> Marek </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiyashka </PERSON>, whose company, Changes, handles orders for Batman-themed shirts. `` It's been hot since early April and will probably be hot until October.'' The Batman bug has bitten scores of fans. `` Stores that normally would not carry or rarely carry any movie merchandise _ <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>, for example _ are carrying Batman merchandise,'' said <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Nye </PERSON>, publisher of Biz! The Show Business Catalogue. But what if `` Batman'' the movie does n't meet the feverish expectations, and the movie fizzles? Will retailers be left with a surplus of Batman pencil erasers, refrigerator magnets and handcuffs? Although movie audiences have eagerly greeted the `` Batman'' preview trailer, the <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION> film is still an unknown quantity. Few people in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> have seen it. What's more, the Batman character has limited audience appeal, according to a 1988 marketing study. In the test by <ORGANIZATION> Marketing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Evaluation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Batman </PERSON> was less popular than Deputy Dawg, <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullins </PERSON>, Chicken Little, the Incredible Hulk and <PERSON> Beany </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Raisins, in fact, proved four times more appealing than the Caped Crusader. `` On the strength of the character's appeal, ` <PERSON> Batman </PERSON>' as a movie will have a hard time finding an audience,'' said <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON>, president of Marketing Evaluation. `` Our projection ... is that ` Batman' as a movie will flop. But that does not say that if you add up all the nickels and dimes of T-shirts and lunch boxes and memo pads and balloons and every other license category under the sun, that you ca n't aggregate all of that into $ 1 billion of license merchandise.'' Since the <PERSON> Batman </PERSON> license holders, <ORGANIZATION> DC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Comics </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION>, receive from 6 percent to 10 percent of the wholesale price of Batman items, sales from merchandise could generate a windfall. Furthermore, store displays of the more than 100 different Batman products may encourage reluctant moviegoers to take a chance on the film. Still, while not everyone is pessimistic about the movie's chances, others are concerned that the span of <PERSON> Batman </PERSON> goods may be too wide `` In the gift business, I think there's an extraordinary opportunity here,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Applause </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, makers of Batman plastic figurines, pencil toppers, stationery, dolls, coffee mugs and a Batman `` suction-cup item,'' which resembles the Garfield cat dolls which some people attach to car windows. `` But there's no getting around it. The appeal for <PERSON> Batman </PERSON> is somewhat limited and somewhat adult,'' <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON> said. `` Last year, we did ` <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabbit </PERSON>' merchandise. Now we'll probably do as much volume with ` <PERSON> Batman </PERSON>' as we did with ` <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabbit </PERSON>. But we did it over a much wider age range with ` <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabbit </PERSON>' than ` Batman.''' Among those cranking out Batman-related items are View Master, Hallmark Cards, Butterick Patterns, One-Stop Posters and Fruit-of-the-Loom. The underwear maker is shipping a Batman-festooned children's brief, part of the company's <ORGANIZATION> Funpals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Briefs </ORGANIZATION>, which includes ALF, Superman, Looney Tunes and <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabbit </PERSON> `` I think -LRB- the Batman underwear -RRB- will be one of our top properties this year, if not the No. 1. seller,'' said Fruit-of-the-Loom marketing manager <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> Thermos, too, is confident that its Batman lunch kit _ a lunch box and an insulated bottle _ will be a hit. `` It's definitely going to be in the Top 10 in our lineup,'' said Thermos spokesman <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Becker </PERSON>. `` Right up there with <PERSON> Barbie </PERSON> and Teen-age Mutant Ninja Turtles.''

<TEXT>
 Avoiding the bothersome and time-consuming process of actually writing original stories, filmmakers are building new movies from a heap of dusty board games, old songs and tattered comic books. `` Batman'' may not be the only movie adaptation, but the Caped Crusader may set a record for having the most previous lives _ in a variety of comic books, a TV series, three television cartoons and two feature films. The latest is the <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION> extravaganza starring <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Keaton </PERSON> as <PERSON> Batman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicholson </PERSON> as his fiendish foil, the Joker. With an average $ 18 million riding on every studio release, it pays to stick with retreads. Look at all the `` <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON>'' sequels. See <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON> remaking `` Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown'' _ a critically acclaimed movie by Spanish filmmaker <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Almodovar </PERSON> that was released only last year. And watch <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> redo 1963's `` Lord of the Flies.'' The plots for `` You Light Up My Life'' and `` Ode to <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Joe </PERSON>'' were taken from old records. `` Clue'' and the upcoming `` Monopoly the Movie'' were appropriated from parlor games. `` Batman,'' like the Superman films and a squadron of other current and future live-action movies, are all inspired by comic books: `` <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON>,'' `` <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Starr </PERSON>,'' `` The Return of the Swamp Thing,'' `` The Punisher,'' `` Captain <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' `` Watchmen,'' `` Spiderman,'' `` Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'' and <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Box </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Tales From the Crypt.'' `` There's something about the movie business that's really voracious as far as stories and characters are concerned,'' said director <PERSON> Wes </PERSON> <PERSON> Craven </PERSON>, who transformed a <ORGANIZATION> DC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Comic </ORGANIZATION> into 1982's `` Swamp Thing.'' `` Since the characters and stories in comics are, in a sense, pre-sold, there's a temptation to use a character that's already got a running start.'' <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Freedman </PERSON>, who spun the independent comic `` Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'' into a toy line, a television series and an upcoming feature film, said, `` A lot of people did n't realize that comic books were not necessarily a kiddie medium. ... Some comic books deal with pretty serious topics.'' Comics also unfold in a lively style that usually translates easily to film, suggesting offbeat, imaginative cinematography. `` Actually, a comic is a visual movie,'' said the inventor of `` Captain America'' and veteran comic author <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirby </PERSON>. `` It's a movie drawn by hand.'' But sometimes for the filmmaker, a comic's catchy graphic look is as much a blessing as a curse. Director <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON>, attempting to make a movie based on <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Larson </PERSON>'s `` The Far Side'' comic, has labored to convert <PERSON> Larson </PERSON>'s distinctive caricatures into living, breathing screen images After filming a five-minute `` Far Side'' test, <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> passed on the project last year. <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> is still trying to convince another studio that his adaptation can work. And while comic-book writers never have to worry about the cost of elaborate special effects, movie studios do. `` The real tricky thing in ` Swamp Thing' was that the comic book had a tremendous amount of mutation _ heads with just hands on them, strange monsters _ and at that time the budget for the movie was $ 2.5 million,'' said <PERSON> Craven </PERSON>. `` The effects were completely outside of our budget. So we had to deal with more human villains and creations. I think we used one dwarf.'' Comic-book characters also have a diversity of personalities, and movie studios are bound to select the personality with the broadest possible audience appeal. Take <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION>, and its approach to `` Batman.'' As remembered by fans of the television series and feature film of the late 1960s, <PERSON> Batman </PERSON> is a campy crimefighter, a goofy do-gooder. But those familiar with the early DC Comic recollect a darker, obsessive figure. And in the 1986 <PERSON> Batman </PERSON> graphic novel collection `` The Dark Knight Returns,'' the Caped Crusader is a troubled vigilante. The latter two Batmans would never be mistaken for matinee idols. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> producers did n't seem sure which <PERSON> Batman </PERSON> they wanted. From the final, dark `` Batman'' script written by <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamm </PERSON>, to the upbeat shooting script doctored by <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Skaaren </PERSON>, <PERSON> Batman </PERSON> loses his paranoid fears. The Joker, cast as a bizarre, overwhelmingly malevolent criminal in <PERSON> Hamm </PERSON>'s screenplay, appears as a droll, almost lighthearted thug in the finished film. And that may leave some comic-book devotees disappointed. `` I'm going to see ` Batman,''' said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>, director of the new documentary `` Comic Book Confidential,'' which traces the history of the comics. `` But it has nothing to do with the comic book _ absolutely nothing.''

<HEAD>Schools Grapple With Asbestos Cleanup Law</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The `` A-Team'' had to wait until classes let out to descend into the boys' gym office at <ORGANIZATION> Dimner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beeber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> so they did n't frighten students with their masks and billowy, airtight suits. Their mission is to remove asbestos insulation from a leaking steam pipe as required by a federal law that is forcing every school in the nation to take costly and drastic steps to control a mineral once used widely as a fire retardant. It is now linked to lung cancer and other diseases. `` I've seen people die of asbestosis,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Breslin </PERSON>, abatement supervisor for the <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> and a former pipe insulator at the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shipyard </LOCATION>. `` I'm not interested in catching it.'' It's a fight some say could have been avoided if asbestos companies had heeded and divulged early warnings of health risks. Instead, the substance was used in insulation, ceilings, floors and walls for decades. The <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> will have to spend $ 425.6 million to remove asbestos from more than 400 buildings, including 291 used by children, in addition to more than $ 50 million already spent on asbestos abatement in the nation's sixth-largest school district. Every school had to submit an asbestos management plan by May 9 or face fines up to $ 5,000 a day under the Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act of 1986. Some 21 percent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> school systems had violated the law by not filing plans before the original Oct. 12 deadline or obtaining a deferral to May 9. <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> schools were fifth-worst with 41.3 percent failing to comply. <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> had 41.5 percent not in compliance; <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, 41.9 percent; <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, 43.9 percent; and <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, 46.2 percent. Compliance generally has been higher for public than private schools, said <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Alicia </PERSON> <PERSON> Tenuta </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. An estimated 44,600 of the nation's 107,000 school buildings contain asbestos that could become dangerous. Asbestos fibers can cause asbestosis, a scarring of lung tissue that diminishes breathing capacity; mesothelioma, a cancer of the lining of the chest or abdominal cavity; and lung cancer, often long after exposure. The cleanup law requires only management, not removal, of all asbestos. `` We're talking well into the next century for some of this removal,'' said <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafferty </PERSON>, district asbestos cleanup chief. Nevertheless, the district expects to spend $ 75.8 million fighting asbestos during the next six years. `` We do n't question the need to address this environmental hazard,'' said <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Glassman </PERSON>, associate superintendent for buildings. `` I'm sure responsible school people all over the nation feel the same way. But we do question the imposition of the total burden for doing this on the backs of financially strapped school systems.'' <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has provided little to offset cleanup costs the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> estimates at $ 3 billion nationwide. From fiscal 1985-1988, $ 160 million had been distributed under the Asbestos School Hazard Abatement Act, with $ 47.5 million to be distributed this year, said <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackburn </PERSON>. `` It's clear there's limited resources for schools and a lot of other demands _ educational reform issues, increasing teachers salaries, drug education,'' said <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Packer </PERSON>, coordinator of the Washington-based Asbestos In Schools Coalition. His organization is pushing for more federal money. The law requires states to review plans and monitor abatement. The Department of Environmental Resources, ordered by Gov. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> to review the plans, was 3 -LCB- months late with its report on compliance. It gave <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> schools a higher mark than <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>, with 36 percent noncompliance, but the DER still is developing ways to review the plans, casting uncertainty over cleanups that the law requires to start by July 9. `` School districts either can not go ahead with removal work or run the risk of having to do work over again if it is not approved by DER,'' said state Sen. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` We have acknowledged that we've had a slow start, but we're moving very aggressively now,'' DER Deputy Secretary <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> McClellan </PERSON> said The department is adding staff and plans to hire contractors this summer to speed the reviews. Much of the problem is the constant change brought on by the fragility of asbestos, even after it is declared contained. `` Kids knock up against it with their chairs, stick a pencil in it, or a water leak occurs and breaks it down,'' said <PERSON> Glassman </PERSON>. Those cases are treated as emergencies by the 30-member full-time `` A-Team'' trained in an EPA-certified program. A `` C-Team'' of 60 maintenance workers has been cleared for part-time work. Both teams use the same procedures as workers in other schools once a problem is located. Using plastic sheeting, the Beeber A-Team has sealed the boy's gym office where the leaking pipe was found Workers pass through two additional chambers of plastic that serve as safety traps. The office is ventilated by a filter that catches 99.97 percent of any fibers. Each worker going in dons two suits of a non-breathable synthetic material. A health hygienist monitors the air they breathe through masks. When work begins in earnest this week with the end of school, the asbestos will be sprayed with a wetting agent, cut with a razor knife, sprayed again and bagged. No more than 20 pounds per bag because the bag might break. On the way out, the workers shed one suit in one chamber, the second in the second chamber, to ensure no fibers leave with them. By the time they are done, air samples must show less than 0.01 fibers per cubic centimeter. `` At times it might seem like overkill, but you never know when you're going to have a problem,'' <PERSON> Breslin </PERSON> said. Each step is recorded: the date work started, how much asbestos is removed, where it is taken, how many fibers showed up on samples. `` Since there's such a long gestation period for these cancers and these cancerlike diseases, it's possible that 30, 40, 50 years would go by and then someone who gets cancer would file a personal injury suit,'' said <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Donovan </PERSON>, attorney for the school district. `` I do n't want my successors to have to try to reconstruct what happened in 1988, 1989 and 1990.''

Carmakers have prepared for the rule and more than half of 1989-model cars have such belts, but an industry official said Monday the order may speed up installations carmakers had planned for 1990 models. The rule takes effect in mid-December and will apply to all cars built after that, except convertibles. Vans, small trucks and utility vehicles would also be unaffected. The agency has announced plans to include all such vehicles at a later date, possibly for the 1991 model year.

 <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> says it intends to sell a subsidiary that accounted for a third of its revenue last year in another step by the troubled computer maker to raise cash. <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it will sell its computer data storage subsidiary to California-based <ORGANIZATION> Seagate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> for $ 300 million in cash and notes and $ 150 million worth of <ORGANIZATION> Seagate </ORGANIZATION> stock. The data storage unit, <ORGANIZATION> Imprimis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>, was established as a separate <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary last year and accounted for a third of the company's $ 3.6 billion in revenue, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Foltz </PERSON>.

 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> on Monday grounded all 12 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737-400 aircraft operated by British carriers following two recent engine failures. Both incidents involved damage to fan blades in CFM56-3C engines manufactured by <ORGANIZATION> SNECMA </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in a joint venture with <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The same engine and plan also was involved in a fatal crash in January. In <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> KIRO-TV </ORGANIZATION> reported that <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> officials were preparing an airworthiness directive based on the British action, but there was no immediate indication what the contents would be. Spokesman <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> confirmed only that there had been talks Monday between <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> officials and representatives of the manufacturer. `` We consider our communications with the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> to be essentially private,'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said. On Friday, a Dan-Air 737-400 carrying 100 charter passengers to <ORGANIZATION> Minorca </ORGANIZATION> returned to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Gatwick </LOCATION> airport after developing severe vibration in one engine. The airline said the problem developed 15 minutes into the flight at an altitude of 31,000 feet. On Sunday, a <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Midlands </LOCATION> 737-400 flying from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> airport to <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, with 80 people aboard made an emergency landing at <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Midlands </LOCATION> airport after a problem developed in one engine In both cases, the airlines reported that turbofan blades had been damaged. Questions had been raised about the engines in January after the crash of a <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Midlands </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737-400 at <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Midlands </LOCATION> airport that killed 47 people. The plane was equipped with the CFM56-3C engines. The pilot had reported that one engine had failed in flight, but investigators later found the plane's good engine had been shut down before the emergency landing was attempted. The investigation of that crash has not been completed.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> says it continues to monitor maintenance practices at strikebound <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, although the company and an <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman say the agency told <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> informally it had turned up no irregularities in maintenance paperwork. In a recording played since Friday on its toll-free telephone `` hot line'' for employees, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> has advised it that recent inspections at maintenance hubs in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> did not uncover any systemwide problems. <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said Monday he could n't confirm the agency told Eastern no paperwork irregularities had been found He said the final report on a record-keeping investigation that ended May 12 had not yet been submitted to acting <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Whittington </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Barker </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, confirmed that the agency had told Eastern the information in question. He also noted that the final report has n't yet been given to <PERSON> Whittington </PERSON>. Eastern's unions and others have raised questions about maintenance and safety at the airline, which has weathered a crippling strike since March 4. Rep. <PERSON> Cardiss </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, D-Ill., chairwoman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on Government Activities and <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION>, recently wrote <PERSON> Whittington </PERSON> that she was concerned that shortages of staff and spare parts could be hampering <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s ability to properly maintain its fleet <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> undertook a `` special surveillance'' of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s overall safety after the strike began, although he said `` There is no separate, distinct inspection currently going on vis-a-vis <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s maintenance.'' <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Matell </PERSON>, a spokesman for Eastern in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, said the telephone recording was made by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashlock </PERSON> on Friday. `` <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> informally advised us today that the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> maintenance inspections turned up no irregularities in paperwork or gaps in missing records,'' the recording said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> concluded that it could not discover any evidence showing a systemwide maintenance problem -LRB- at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- with improper record entries or missing documents,'' <PERSON> Ashlock </PERSON> said on the tape, which still was being played Monday. Eastern's recording also said the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> had reinstated eight <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> maintenance supervisors at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> John </LOCATION> <LOCATION> F. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> who had been temporarily suspended. Early last month, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> temporarily surrendered its repair station certificate at <LOCATION> JFK </LOCATION> after the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> determined the carrier had failed to follow its system for recording and inspecting maintenance work. But <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergen </PERSON>, a spokeswoman in the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>'s Eastern Region office at <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, said Monday that any suspensions or reinstatements of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> personnel would have been made by the airline itself, not the agency. `` We never took any action against any individuals,'' she said. The suspension of the JFK certificate was for actions that predated the March 4 start of the strike, which pushed <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> into bankruptcy court five days later. Soon after the JFK certificate was pulled, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> sent nine inspectors to <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s main base in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> to determine if violations of maintenance record - keeping rules, such as those found in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, existed in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> JFK, <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Hartsfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> are the sites of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s three principal maintenance facilities. In her June 1 letter to <PERSON> Whittington </PERSON>, <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> said her subcommittee's staff reviewed internal company documents indicating that `` manpower and parts shortages continue to plague the maintenance function of Eastern.'' <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, who is recovering from recent surgery, was reported to be unavailable to comment Monday on the Eastern recording. Although the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> says it is not conducting a special investigation of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> maintenance practices at <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s pilots union contends the union has participated in such a probe. Representatives of the pilots and Machinists unions met with <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> inspectors May 15-16 in the context of that inquiry, according to a pilots union spokesman who asked not to be identified.

<HEAD>Preacher's Downfall Hurts Already-Depressed Baton Rouge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Preacher <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s admission of sin was a blow not only to his television ministry but to the economy of a city that already was hurting from the downturn in the oil industry. At its peak, <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s ministry was a $ 150-million-a-year operation. It remains one of the biggest industries in the area, but area business owners and managers know that they are n't as well off as they were before scandal touched the fundamentalist evangelist. `` When you take a $ 150 million industry and cripple it, of course the entire community's going to feel it,'' said <PERSON> Butch </PERSON> <PERSON> Spyridon </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Baton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Visitors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>. It was in February 1988 when <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> confessed to moral failure from the stage of his Family Worship Center church at the heart of his 270-acre compound. Although <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> did n't admit specifics, a rival minister revealed that the transgression involved liaisons with a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> prostitute. <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>'s economy has paid along with <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> for his sins. `` Where I used to get 150 rooms a night, now I may get 75,'' said <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Michelet </PERSON>, manager of a Holiday Inn near <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s compound. `` And I'm probably the only hotel in <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION> still getting any of that business.'' <PERSON> Michelet </PERSON> remembers the old days fondly _ <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s followers never got rowdy and did n't frequent the motel bar. `` They were the easiest guests you could have,'' <PERSON> Michelet </PERSON> said. `` It was great business.'' The huge ministry had scheduled nine conventions in 1988 expected to pull 45,000 delegates and $ 14 million into the <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION> economy. Most would have come for the family-oriented, four-day `` camp meetings'' <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> usually scheduled over holiday periods that traditionally generated little tourist-oriented revenue. `` We lost millions last year, although -LRB- some -RRB- of that was on paper because he had more meetings scheduled for 1988 than ever before,'' <PERSON> Spyridon </PERSON> said. `` His ministry has been our largest single supplier of convention delegates. Make no mistake about it. <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> was good business for <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>. `` And he still is. He still draws. It just is n't what it used to be,'' the visitor-bureau director added. `` And we've really hustled to try and book more groups and make up for what we lost from Mr. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s problems. Fortunately, we managed to land the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Hot Air Balloon National Championships for 1989-1991.'' Almost half the faculty has left the <ORGANIZATION> Jimmy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Swaggart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bible </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. Many left to save their credentials with the Assemblies of God, the denomination that defrocked <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> when he refused to accept a one-year rehabilitation church leaders ordered. Many have left the state for employment and schools elsewhere, dumping homes and apartments onto a real estate market already suffering with the rest of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> from the downturn in the state's oil-based economy. Faculty members from the Bible college are among about 600 employees who have either been laid off or left <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s employ since the ministry boasted in its 1986 heyday that its roster of 1,400-plus employees and $ 16 million payroll had a `` snowball'' spending effect that infused about $ 30.5 million into the <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION> economy. Attendance at the college is off by about 75 percent _ from 1,450 in 1987 to 400 now. Since 1981, the ministry spent more than $ 123 million on construction and land purchases, making it the largest sponsor of construction in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Parish </LOCATION> over the past five years. But the first activity <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s tearful confession stopped at the complex was construction. A new $ 9 million Bible college dormitory still stands half-finished. Work was frozen and properties were mortgaged for $ 12 million to cover construction debts, records show. `` <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> still brings people in. He still makes business for <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, vice president of a restaurant near <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s ministries. But it's not what it used to be, <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> said.

 In one day, the number of coal miners on strike in <LOCATION> Appalachia </LOCATION> increased fivefold, and many of the union members who have walked off the job expect their numbers will swell even more. `` They're going to try to shut down all the union and non-union mines by the end of next week,'' said <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> miner. `` You'll see a nationwide and Canadian strike _ whatever it takes to get this settled.'' At issue is a 2-month-old walkout by the <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> against <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> over wage, benefit and work-rule disputes. But miners say that's not all that's at stake: Many believe that if <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> wins, a precedent will be set that could reverse gains made by labor unions early this century. About 1,600 union miners have been striking <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> operations in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> since early April. On Monday, thousands of miners at other coal companies in <LOCATION> Appalachia </LOCATION> walked off the job, many saying they have to take a stand now or lose their union rights. `` It's going to be the same for all coal miners if <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> beats the <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> on this,'' said one miner who walked off his job Monday at Hobet Mining in <LOCATION> Mingo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. Underground miners in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> refused to show up for the overnight shift Monday, less than eight hours after many attended a rally at which <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> told them to `` rise up and fight back.'' Three <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> mines also reported workers failed to return for today's midnight shift. `` Whatever it's gon na take to get the court systems to drop the fines and get our fellas out of jail in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, that's how long it'll last,'' said <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> field representative in <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> already was involved in a two-state strike against <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> and a smaller strike against <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beckley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mining </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. In the <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> strike, a state judge in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> jailed three union leaders and fined the union $ 3 million for disobeying a court order limiting pickets. Monday's wildcat strikes spread to operations throughout the rest of <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> 17, which has 8,000 members in southern <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. The president of the <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> estimated 10,000 miners refused to show up for work. `` It's fair to say that all of southern <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> is affected, as far as I can tell,'' said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, president of the coal association. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s largest coal field employer, <ORGANIZATION> Consolidation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION>, said only one of its operations was struck, but it immediately asked for and obtained a court order telling its workers to return to work. Attorneys for the company argued that when the 250 of its 4,000 workers walked out, they violated terms of a 1988 contract barring strikes and that their walkout could keep the company from meeting its contracts. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Knapp </PERSON> agreed and ordered the men back to the <LOCATION> Rowland </LOCATION> mine pending another hearing June 22, when the temporary order expires. <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's top coal producer, saw 2,360 union miners walk out at midnight Sunday, said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> attorney. <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> miners struck April 5 after working more than 14 months without a contract. <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> had refused to sign the 1988 <ORGANIZATION> Bituminous </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operators </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> agreement that most other coal companies had signed. About 100 miners have been striking at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beckley </LOCATION> since January. Over the course of the <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> walkout by 1,600 miners in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, more than 2,200 miners, retirees and their wives have been arrested for civil disobedience such as blocking coal trucks. Union leaders did not return several telephone calls from The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> seeking comment. The leaders have repeatedly stressed that the strike was not sanctioned by the union. Under terms of the 1988 <ORGANIZATION> BCOA </ORGANIZATION> agreement, miners can take a 10-day `` memorial period'' to air grievences. None of the coal companies struck Monday said they were informed that this would be a 10-day work stoppage.

 <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> billionaire <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> says he boosted his stake in <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, to more than 6 percent from 4.2 percent, for investment purposes, not to mount a takeover of the defense contractor. <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> revealed Monday that <ORGANIZATION> Valhi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> NL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and various other <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> companies had spent $ 69.27 million, including commissions, to purchase 1.44 million shares of <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> stock between May 15 and Thursday. The purchases, which ranged in price from $ 47 to $ 49 per share, make him one of the largest individual shareholders in the <LOCATION> Calabasas </LOCATION>, Calif.-based company. <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> stock inched up 62.5 cents to close at $ 49.62 -LCB- in composite trading Monday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. In a filing with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> said the lastest purchases were `` for purposes of investment and in order to acquire a significant equity interest in the company.'' The filing said <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> does not `` currently have any plans to acquire control of the company by stock ownership or otherwise,'' although it did not rule out such a move in the future. Earlier this year, <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> revealed a 5.3 percent stake in the company, prompting <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> to create an employee stock ownership plan that effectively blocked any takeover ploy. One day after the creation of the <ORGANIZATION> ESOP </ORGANIZATION>, which holds 17 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> stock, <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> reduced his holding to 4.2 percent. Analysts have said the <ORGANIZATION> ESOP </ORGANIZATION>'s holding effectively blocks a <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> takeover because in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, where the company is incorporated, a buyout must be approved by holders of 85 percent of a company's stock. <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>' <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> filing said he met with <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tellep </PERSON> and Vice Chairman <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marafino </PERSON> on May 15, the same day <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> began his recent purchases, to discuss his investment. <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Meder </PERSON> described the meeting as `` cordial,'' but said the company would have no further comment on <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>' action. In the filing, <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> included a March 31 letter to <PERSON> Tellep </PERSON> saying, `` We view <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> as a well managed company. We have no plans, or desire, to disrupt management. We expect to be a constructive, long-term shareholder.'' Analysts said Monday they believe that description still holds. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinney </PERSON>, who follows <ORGANIZATION> Valhi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baird </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>' `` first and foremost'' duty is to enhance stockholder value and `` greed and calculation will always be second to this interest. He suggested <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> hopes to make money on the <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> stock to use in other possible takeover moves. <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>, whose worth is estimated at $ 1.5 billion by <ORGANIZATION> Fortune </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION>, has holdings in chemical, timber and sugar industries.

<TEXT>
 The government is giving carmakers six months to equip all new hardtop cars with backseat lap and shoulder belts, but a safety research group says the new rule does n't go far enough. Industry officials, meanwhile, said the order announced Monday by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Admnistration </ORGANIZATION> came as no surprise but nonetheless might speed up some planned installations. More than half of 1989 cars already have such belts, and they are scheduled for nearly all 1990 models, industry and government officials said. The rule will apply to all cars built after mid-December, except convertibles, which are unlikely to be affected until the 1991 model year. The safety agency said it was still working on detailed installation requirements for the rear-seat belts as well as orders requiring them for convertibles, vans, small trucks and utility vehicles. `` Today's action makes the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> one of the first major vehicle-producing nations in the world to require rear-seat lap and shoulder belts by regulation,'' the highway safety agency said in announcing the rule. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION>, said testing rules are needed to ensure that shoulder safety belt systems work properly in each car's back seat. `` Our position is that if all you do is write a rule that the manufacturers are already following, it's not worth doing,'' <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> said. Rear seat cushions in some cars may be too soft or improperly designed for effective shoulder belt use in the rear, he said. The institute is an independent, nonprofit research and educational organization funded by the insurance industry. In addition to the rear lap-shoulder belts, 1990 models must have front-seat air bags or automatic shoulder restraints. Carmakers can either install dual air bags, dual automatic restraints, or a single air bag on the driver's side and a manual or automatic restraint on the passenger's side. Air bags inflate in a crash. Automatic restraints move into place as the driver or passenger enters the car. The highway safety administration, which is part of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION>, said about 2,000 rear-seat passengers die each year in road crashes, and 600 lives could be saved if even existing lap belts were used by everyone riding in the back seat. The agency did not estimate the number of lives that might be saved with the new order, which would not affect any cars now on the road. However, if both shoulder and lap belts were used by the 16 percent of back-seat passengers who now use lap-only belts, it said, 25 more lives and 500 serious injuries could be avoided each year. Government surveys show that front-seat safety belt use has reached an all-time high of 47 percent, with 33 states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> requiring their use. Use of rear-seat belts has increased eightfold over the last six years, with five states requiring it, officials said. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowditch </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vehicle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, said 50 percent to 60 percent of 1989 cars have both lap and shoulder belts as standard equipment in the rear seat. He said all manufacturers had planned to put the belts on even without a federal order `` in the next year or two.'' He said the order `` may hurry up the schedule a little bit for a few models.'' According to the insurance institute, lap and shoulder belts are optional for the rear seat on <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> cars and on some <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> models but are already standard equipment on many <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and on all General Motors cars and most foreign autos sold in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The newly established <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION> stock exchange will start trading on Saturday, about six months later than originally planned, its director announced Tuesday. <PERSON> Fawzi </PERSON> <PERSON> Behzad </PERSON> told a news conference the opening was delayed in order to complete discussions with financial authorities on market-activity rules. He said the dealing hall, located in the city's financial center, also had to be completed. <PERSON> Behzad </PERSON> and other officials say they hope the island's stock exchange will become the Wall Street of the Gulf region. `` Now we deal in local <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION> companies. We chall be moving to <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> companies ... then to the international companies,'' he said. The <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION> exchange will seek to attract private Arab wealth accumulated during the 1970s oil boom that is currently invested abroad. Such holdings are estimated at around $ 150 billion. Its cautious beginning reflects official determination to avoid overheating of the kind that triggered the 1982 crash of <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s unofficial Al-Manakh stock market under the pressure of $ 94 billion worth of post-dated checks <PERSON> Behzad </PERSON> said the market would trade for just 90 minutes daily, and will close on Fridays, the Moslem weekend. He said five individual brokers and two financial companies would trade stock of 29 Bahraini national companies that have a combined total of 4.4 billion shares. Their total nominal value is set at $ 1.6 billion. Share values will be limited to a 15 percent move up or down on any trading day. Nationals of other <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> states will be allowed to deal on the <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION> market, but company ownership percentages have not yet been defined, <PERSON> Behzad </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> GCC </ORGANIZATION>, which groups <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, has set the ceiling for ownership by citizens of one member-country in companies of another at 25 percent. <PERSON> Behzad </PERSON> said the stock exchange's founding decree permits eventual trading in government bonds, real estate and other financial instruments but set no date for the expansion. The <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION> stock exchange opening comes as the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> region anticipates an economic recovery based on improved oil prices and reconstruction after last August's cease-fire in the 8-year Iran-Iraq war. <PERSON> Behzad </PERSON> said he hoped that each <ORGANIZATION> GCC </ORGANIZATION> country would eventually have its own exchange so that `` we shall be able to coordinate for the future ... It will push a Gulf market in general.'' <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION> last month opened a small-scale stock exchange where <ORGANIZATION> GCC </ORGANIZATION> nationals are permitted to deal. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> has had an official stock exchange since the mid-1970s and is reactivating the unofficial Al-Manakh market, while unofficial trading is carried out in <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>HCA Sells Two More Divisions To Reduce Debt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has sold two more divisions, bringing to five the number of subsidiaries spun off by the health care giant since it began restructuring three years ago. Company officials announced Monday Nashville-based <ORGANIZATION> HCA </ORGANIZATION> is selling <ORGANIZATION> HCA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> to the division's employees for $ 43 million Late Monday night, the firm announced the sale of <ORGANIZATION> HCA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychiatric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 1.25 billion in cash to the top managers of that company and to employees through an employee stock ownership plan. Both deals are subject to various conditions, including approval by the <ORGANIZATION> HCA </ORGANIZATION> board of directors and completion of certain regulatory requirements. The management division sale is expected to close within 60 days, while sale of the psychiatric subsidiary should be completed during the second half of 1989, according to a statement from <ORGANIZATION> HCA </ORGANIZATION>. The spinoffs are designed to meet <ORGANIZATION> HCA </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Frist </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>'s goal of paring <ORGANIZATION> HCA </ORGANIZATION> back from what was a spreading medical conglomerate to a company focusing solely on acute care medical hospitals. Still to be sold are <ORGANIZATION> HCA </ORGANIZATION>'s international operations, expected to bring in excess of $ 150 million. After all the spinoffs are completed, <ORGANIZATION> HCA </ORGANIZATION> will be left with about 80 acute care domestic hospitals with about $ 3 billion in annual revenues. The buyers of <ORGANIZATION> HCA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> were led by the subsidiary's senior management and the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investment firm of <ORGANIZATION> Welsh </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carson </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anderson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Stowe </PERSON> They agreed in principle to purchase the outstanding capital stock of <ORGANIZATION> HCA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> HCA </ORGANIZATION> will retain 10 percent ownership in the company. <ORGANIZATION> HCA </ORGANIZATION> Management provides management and consulting services to more than 230 hospitals and health care facilities totaling more than 38,000 beds in 44 states and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. The company employs more than 700 people nationwide, including 160 at its <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> headquarters. Under the psychiatric division agreement, <ORGANIZATION> HCA </ORGANIZATION> will retain $ 150 million of the company's preferred stock and will acquire warrants to purchase from 15 percent to 30 percent of the common stock of the psychiatric company. <ORGANIZATION> HCA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychiatric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> owns 52 psychiatric and chemical dependency facilities in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> with approximately 5,500 beds and has 6,500 employees. The subsidiaries bring to three the number that <ORGANIZATION> HCA </ORGANIZATION> has sold in a week _ and to five the number it has sold since 1986. <ORGANIZATION> HCA </ORGANIZATION> spun off <ORGANIZATION> Allied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> last week for $ 44.6 million to a management team led by <PERSON> Haywood </PERSON> <PERSON> Cochrane </PERSON>, Allied's chief executive officer. Company officials said the sales will help pay off $ 1.3 billion in debts due over the next two years. In October 1986, <ORGANIZATION> HCA </ORGANIZATION> sold its <ORGANIZATION> HCA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plans </ORGANIZATION> division for more than $ 400 million to <ORGANIZATION> Equicor </ORGANIZATION>, a joint venture between <ORGANIZATION> HCA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equitable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Nearly a year later, in September 1987, the company sold 104 rural and suburban hospitals for $ 2 billion to a management-led group that formed a new company called <ORGANIZATION> HealthTrust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Earlier this year, <PERSON> Frist </PERSON> led a management group which took <ORGANIZATION> HCA </ORGANIZATION> private for $ 3.6 billion. The financing arrangements give <ORGANIZATION> HCA </ORGANIZATION> two years to sell at least $ 1.3 million in assets to pay off a short-term loan included in the $ 4 billion financing package.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Osaka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> has begun <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s first trading in stock index options, and transactions in the first two days totaled more than $ 1 billion, the exchange said Tuesday. The trading, begun Monday, aims at offering new investing opportunities to institutional investors, who handle an increasing amount of individuals' financial assets, said an <ORGANIZATION> OSE </ORGANIZATION> official, speaking on condition of anonymity. The <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Nagoya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> are expected to follow <LOCATION> Osaka </LOCATION>'s lead later this year. The official said contracts on the first day totaled 268,000, valued at $ 869 million, but dealings declined to 65,249 contracts valued at $ 207 million on Tuesday. He said daily trading on the world's largest option trading market, the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Option </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, has been estimated at $ 73 million. The official said the <LOCATION> Osaka </LOCATION> trading is based on the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> index of 225 selected stocks. Option contracts give investors the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell the `` basket'' of stocks. Like stock option trading elsewhere in the world, <LOCATION> Osaka </LOCATION>'s system permits investors to hedge their stock portfolios against sudden price fluctuations. At an opening ceremony Monday, <PERSON> Hiroshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Yamanouchi </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> OSE </ORGANIZATION> president, said the stock index options trading system would combine with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s existing stock index futures system to bring a notable expansion in the country's capital and other financial markets. The <ORGANIZATION> OSE </ORGANIZATION> official said non-Japanese companies participating in the stock index option trading are <ORGANIZATION> Baring </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Sogen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>; and seven American companies including <ORGANIZATION> BT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Solomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Board of Trade Tries Home-Mortgage Contract Again</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Despite four failed attempts to offer a futures contract based on home-mortgage rates, the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> has decided it will try once again starting Friday. The contract will track the current coupon for the <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, known as GNMA or <ORGANIZATION> Ginnie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mae </ORGANIZATION>, and will be traded four months in the future in units of $ 100,000. The <ORGANIZATION> BOT </ORGANIZATION> first tried the contract in 1975, and again in 1978, 1984 and 1986. Each eventually fell by the wayside, either because of the complexity of the design or a lack of interest from local traders that kept the contract from being liquid enough to sustain itself. Officials expect this version to succeed because of its simplicity. `` Potentially, the market is bigger than the corporate bond market and with the volatility in mortgages in recent years, there seems to be a real need for some sort of hedging device,'' <ORGANIZATION> BOT </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connell </PERSON> said Monday. `` This should look attractive to savings and loans, mortgage bankers, anybody who originates mortgages or deals in mortgage-backed securities.'' Traditionally, institutional holders of mortgages and mortgage-backed securities bought <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Treasury securities or over-the-counter options as a hedge. But <ORGANIZATION> BOT </ORGANIZATION> officials say the new contract will provide better protection against sudden swings in the interest rate by offering a futures contract that can be matched up with a cash position. `` Let's say you hold a -LRB- GNMA -RRB- coupon for 10 percent. Suddenly, interest rates drop to 9 percent and everybody refinances their mortgages. Now, you've got a check for the original amount, but no longer the revenue stream you thought you would have,'' said <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahan </PERSON>, economist for <ORGANIZATION> Kleinwort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` You could have hedged that if you were able to find a futures position that mirrored your cash position.'' But <PERSON> Kahan </PERSON>, mindful of four failed efforts at such a contract, withheld a prediction on whether investors would take to the product. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Florsheim </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> vice president and hedging consultant and broker for financial institutions, said big customers will `` be the ones to make this product go. `` The savings-and-loan mentality used to be that when you got caught holding mortgages behind interest rates, you put the losers in a drawer and waited until you could get the value back,'' <ORGANIZATION> Florsheim </ORGANIZATION> said. `` The idea now is to get the S & amp; Ls back into the ballgame,'' he said, `` and giving them a hedge like this might be a step in the right direction. People are more aware of the need for this now than at times in the past.''

 Share prices moved broadly lower in early trading today, as the stock market failed to build on the rebound that developed Monday.

<HEAD>Government Forecasters Predict Near-Record Citrus Harvest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 As <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s citrus industry heads into the home stretch of the 1988-1989 harvest, government forecasters reported about 2 million more boxes of oranges harvested than they had calculated last month. The larger crop estimate translates to about $ 24 million more in industry income, with prices for <ORGANIZATION> Valencia </ORGANIZATION> oranges running at about $ 12 a box delivered to processing plants. `` The final value of the crop should be up there near the record'' of $ 1.3 billion set last season, said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>, citrus statistician with the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>. The joint federal and state forecasting service projected Monday that the harvest, which ends July 1, will total 146.3 million boxes of oranges and 55.35 million boxes of grapefruit. A box of oranges is equivalent to 90 pounds of fruit, and a box of grapefruit is equal to 85 pounds. While the orange forecast increased 2 million boxes from last month's estimate because of the bigger <LOCATION> Valencia </LOCATION> crop, the grapefruit estimate was reduced by 500,000 boxes. The grapefruit crop still would be a record, however, just surpassing the 54.8 million-box bumper crop picked in 1979-1980. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> said both the orange and grapefruit adjustments were made to reflect amounts of fruit actually appearing in processing and packing plants. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> citrus forecasters also have had some difficulty nailing down the size of that state's crop, second in size to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s among <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> producers. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, which is just completing its early and midseason orange harvest, reduced its early and midcrop estimate by 1 million boxes to 34 million and lowered its <ORGANIZATION> Valencia </ORGANIZATION> forecast by 2 million boxes to 23 million. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s harvest typically lags behind <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s by three or four months because of differences in climate. Crop forecasters predicted Monday that the juice yield for <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> oranges would remain the same at 1.53 gallons of concentrated juice per box. The last crop estimate of the season will be made July 12, and the final numbers for the completed season will be released Sept. 29, just before the start of the new harvest on Oct. 1.

<TEXT>
 Grain and soybean futures prices rose modestly in early trading today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> following an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report estimating the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> winter wheat crop at an 11-year low. In a report issued after the close of trading Monday, the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> pegged the drought-ravaged winter wheat crop at 1.41 billion bushels, down 10 percent from last year's harvest and 2 percent below the May forecast. But buying enthusiasm was tempered by forecasts for drier-than-normal conditions early next week in the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, which would accelerate the winter wheat harvest. Corn and soybean futures were supported in part by indications of strong export sales of those commodities last week. But lower prices in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> for soybean meal and soybean oil kept a lid on the rally. In early trading, wheat was 1 cent to 1 -LCB- cents higher with the contract for delivery in July at $ 3.90 a bushel; corn was 1 cent to 1 -RCB- cents higher with July at $ 2.50 -LCB- a bushel; oats were 1 -RCB- cents to 2 cents higher with July at $ 1.59 -RCB- a bushel; soybeans were -LCB- cent to 2 \ cents higher with July at $ 6.95 \ a Cattle futures were mostly lower while pork futures were mostly higher in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle were .25 cent lower to .10 cent higher with June at 70.32 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent to .22 cent lower with August at 80.45 cents a pound; hogs were unchanged to .22 cent higher with June at 48.20 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .10 cent to .67 cent higher with July at 34.20 cents a pound. Livestock and meat futures advanced on Monday.

<HEAD>Trade Deficit Tops $30 Billion in First Quarter</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Adds 3 grafs with other economic reports today; Also moved on
general news wires</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The deficit in the broadest measure of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade worsened dramatically in the first three months of the year, widening to $ 30.69 billion, the government reported today. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the deficit in the current account was 7 percent larger than the $ 28.68 billion imbalance run up in the final three months of 1988. The current account, also known as the balance of payments, is the most important trade statistic because it measures not only trade in merchandise but also transactions in services, primarily investment flows between countries. The merchandise trade deficit improved sharply in the first quarter, narrowing by 13.7 percent to $ 27.63 billion. However, this improvement was wiped out by a decline in the services category, which fell to a tiny $ 369 million surplus from a surplus of $ 8.36 billion in the fourth quarter of 1988. Analysts said the steep drop in the services surplus reflected the fact that the dollar rose in the first quarter, lowering <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> businesses' earnings overseas. The current account provides a measure of the amount of money this country must raise abroad to finance its economy. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, because of huge merchandise trade deficits, was transformed from the world's largest creditor nation to the largest debtor country during the 1980s. Simply put, that means that foreigners now own more <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assets than Americans hold overseas. Both the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administrations have claimed that this is a sign of strength, showing that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> remains a popular place to invest. However, private economists have warned that the growing debt burden will ultimately lower <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s standard of living as more and more dollars are handed over to foreigners as interest payments on the debt. With the $ 30.69 billion current account deficit in the first quarter, the imbalance between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> holdings abroad and foreign holdings in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has probably climbed past $ 500 billion, up from $ 368 billion at the end of 1987. However, the government will not release the official calculation of that figure until June 29. As recently as 1981, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> ran surpluses in its current account because the nation's cushion in overseas investment earnings was enough to offset perennial merchandise trade deficits. But in 1985, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> became a net debtor for the first time in 71 years as the value of American investments overseas were surpassed by the value of foreign holdings in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. That reflected the fact that billions of dollars had been transferred into foreign hands to pay for foreign cars and television sets and other imported goods. Today's report said that in addition to the $ 27.63 billion deficit in merchandise trade and the $ 369 million surplus in the services category, the $ 30.69 billion current account deficit reflected payments of $ 3.42 billion in foreign aid and pensions to Americans living overseas. In other government reports on the economy today: _ Regulatory agencies reported that the nation's 2,938 savings and loan institutions amassed net losses of $ 3.4 billion in the first quarter of the year, while the 13,001 commercial <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks were enjoying record profits totaling $ 7.3 billion For all of 1988, <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls toted up $ 13 billion in losses and banks posted a record $ 25.1 billion in profits. _ Retail sales rose a sluggish 0.1 percent in May, held down by a decline in department store sales and a slowdown in activity at automobile dealership, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Sales climbed to a seasonally adjusted $ 141.1 billion last month after rising 1 percent in April.

<TEXT>
 A third of all major bank fraud cases are not being pursued because the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lacks resources, Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburg </PERSON> said today. <PERSON> Thornburg </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fraud </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> a recent survey indicates 8,343 bank fraud related matters and cases pending in various <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney's of <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> offices, with 4,000 classified as `` major bank fraud.'' `` Over 2,300 of the pending cases were inactive for lack of adequate investigatory resources or prosecutorial resources, and 1,332 of those were classified as major bank fraud,'' he said. <PERSON> Thornburg </PERSON> urged passage of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> Administration's thrift bailout bill, which includes $ 50 million to investigate major thrift industry fraud. He said the added money would allow the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to double its bank fraud investigations, adding 200 <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents and 100 prosecutors and other personnel. The attorney general estimated that between 25 percent to 30 percent of the industry's losses are attributable to fraud. The <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> task force is an inter-agency effort to prosecute malfeasance in the thrift and banking industry. It has come under some criticism for failed prosecutions.

The miners walked out Monday in a show of support for 1,600 <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> members on strike against <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> since April. `` They're going to try to shut down all the union and non-union mines by the end of next week,'' said <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, a striking <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> miner. `` You'll see a nationwide and Canadian strike _ whatever it takes to get this settled.'' An industry official today said the walkout appeared to be confined to southern <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> 17 _ the union's largest, with 8,000 members <ORGANIZATION> Consolidation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said 250 of its 4,000 employees stayed off the job today despite a back-to-work order issued by a federal judge on Monday. The company had argued that its workers were barred by contract from striking. `` As of this morning the court order has been ignored,'' said Consolidated spokesman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kvederis </PERSON>. He had no other word on what the company planned to do. Top union leaders did not immediately return calls today. <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> leaders have insisted the strike was spontaneous and not sanctioned by the union. Under their 1988 contract, the miners can take a 10-day `` memorial period'' and walk off the job to air grievances, but they must give notice beforehand. None of the coal companies struck Monday said they were informed. The president of the <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> estimated 10,000 miners refused to show up for work Monday. The number of mines or mining companies affected by the walkout was not immediately available. Monay's wildcat action was in support of the 2-month-old walkout <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> against <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION>. Many miners say a <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> victory might set a precedent that could reverse gains made by unions early this century. The <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> miners have been working without a contract for 14 months. They went on strike over wages, benefits and working conditions. Over the course of the <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> walkout, more than 2,200 miners, retirees and their spouses have been arrested for civil disobedience such as blocking coal trucks. A state judge in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> has jailed three union leaders and fined the union $ 3 million for disobeying an order limiting pickets at <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION>. `` Whatever it's gon na take to get the court systems to drop the fines and get our fellas out of jail in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, that's how long it'll last,'' said <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> field representative in <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION>.

 Fears of another round of interest rate hikes in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> drove stock prices sharply lower Tuesday. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was down 15.3 points, or 0.7 percent, at 2,123.0, after slumping as much as 22.1 points at midday. At its best, the index was up 1.0 point at the opening. Volume was a moderate 463.8 million shares, up from Monday's 381.8 million shares The market moved lower as sterling dropped, raising fears of higher interest rates. But sterling and stock prices recoverd somewhat when it became clear the Bank of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> was going to use repeated intervention rather than an interest rate hike to support the pound for now, dealers said. Dealers said the market was n't likely to relax its guard in case a British rate hike does materialize. Some players speculated that British authorities might be waiting until after this week's European Parliament elections before taking such an unpopular step as increasing interest rates.

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said Tuesday she fully supports Chancellor of the Exchequer <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> as she moved to dispel reports of a split over monetary policy. In answer to questions in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION>, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said: `` I give full, unequivocal and generous backing to my chancellor, of whom I am very proud.''

Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> has said joining the mechanism could damage the government's anti-inflation battle while <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> has said it would help buttress monetary policies to bring inflation down. However, <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> on Monday also indicated he did n't see sterling joining the mechanism until 1990 at the earliest. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> also said she agreed with <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> that the government's overriding objective is to reduce inflation The Conservative government has come under criticism for its handling of the economy. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s inflation rate has more than doubled to 8 percent in a year while the trade deficit has ballooned. In an effort to fight inflation, the government has pushed up interest rates to 14 percent from a decade low of 7.5 percent last summer.

 The dollar was mixed in busy European trading Tuesday after two reported rounds of intervention by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>. Gold prices dipped. The British pound finished at its lowest level against the dollar in more than two years. But the pound ended above its session lows, as selling pressure cooled after at least three rounds of intervention by the Bank of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> to support the British currency, dealers said. The pound also was helped by comments by Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> aimed at quieting the market jitters over speculation of a rift between her and Chancellor of the Exchequer <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION>, `` I give full, unequivocal and generous backing to my chancellor, of whom I am very proud.'' The dollar began the European day on weak following rumors of intervention by the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> during the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> day. But buying interest re-emerged, pushing the dollar higher in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Then two reported rounds of intervention by the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>, which was joined by the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION>, took the dollar off its peaks, dealers said. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it cost $ 1.5162 to buy one pound late Tuesday. That was the pound's lowest rate against the dollar since February 1987. Late Monday, it cost $ 1.5250. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Monday: 2.0260 West German marks, up from 2.0250; 1.7520 Swiss francs, down from 1.7550; 6.8675 French francs, up from 6.8620; 2.2758 Dutch guilders, down from 2.2835; 1,459.25 Italian lire, down from 1,463.50; 1.2007 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2024. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar rose 0.30 yen to a closing 148.70 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted higher at 149.15 yen. Gold fell in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a late bid price of $ 359.50 a troy ounce, compared with late Monday's $ 359.95.

<HEAD>`Clean Fuels' Expected To Get Boost From Bush Anti-Smog Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s call for <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> to build alternatives to gasoline-powered cars is expected to propel the fledgling `` clean fuels'' move into overdrive. One of the main beneficiaries may be the natural gas industry. It is heavily promoting the idea of running cars on compressed natural gas, which emits less of some pollutants than vehicles burning gasoline or diesel fuel. Natural gas also is a raw material for methanol, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's favored choice for an alternative to gasoline. Oil companies, however, are critical of the methanol move, which they say presents many cost and safety problems. Yet another alternative fuel is ethanol, made from fermented corn and agricultural wastes. It is limited in supply and more expensive than methanol or gasoline. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was seeking to drum up public support for alternative fuels Tuesday with appearances in <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, a big corn producer that last year used more ethanol-based fuel, as a share of its total vehicle fuels market, than any other state. The aim of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposal, announced Monday as part of a broader environmental package, is to reduce vehicles' contribution to air pollution. But it also would mean higher prices for consumers, if gasoline is gradually eliminated, analysts said. Gasoline emits nitrous oxides that are an ingredient in the ozone that causes smog. A key element of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> plan is a phased-in requirement for auto manufacturers to produce alternatives to gasoline-powered autos in the nine major urban areas with the worst smog problems. Half a million such cars would have to be available by 1995, and 1 million would have to be produced each year from 1997 through 2004. The urban areas are <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and `` greater <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>.'' `` It'll be a big boost'' for alternative fuel use, said <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Denman </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Safe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communication </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, an environmental group that favors reducing use of fossil fuels, mainly by improving energy and vehicle efficiency. The technology exists to produce cars capable of running on alternative fuels. The auto companies have hesitated to undertake full-scale production because of a concern that the fuels are not yet widely available, while the oil companies balk at producing large quantities of the fuels until the vehicles win consumer acceptance. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>, administrator of the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, told reporters the auto and oil industries must find a way of resolving this stalemate. `` The point of this program ... is to make sure that we solve the chicken-and-egg problem, that we have the fuel available to service the cars and the cars available to use the fuel,'' he said, adding that industry must `` ensure that that happens.'' The oil industry strongly criticized the alternative fuels portion of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal, which will be sent to <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> in coming weeks. The industry wants a pilot program, at least partly financed by the government, to work out the technical and economic kinks before commercial-scale production is required. `` We are disappointed by the administration's apparent preference for mandating alternate-fuel vehicles, an extremely costly and inflexible step which would provide highly uncertain environmental benefits and presumably require ... higher prices for all fuels,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, the oil industry's main lobbying group. The oil companies, which sell about 100 billion gallons of gasoline a year, are quick to point out the drawbacks to alternative fuels. Methanol, for example, emits less carbon monoxide than gasoline but produces formaldehyde and other harmful poisons. Methanol is highly corrosive, so a car's fuel tank and the entire fuel-delivery system must be made of a corrosion-resistant material such as stainless steel. Engines running on compressed natural gas produce almost no soot and less carbon monoxide, nitrous oxides and hydrocarbons than gasoline engines do. But some experts worry that greatly increased use of natural gas would deplete the existing surpluses and could lead to greater reliance on Middle Eastern energy suppliers.

 The Big Three automakers said Tuesday back-seat lap and shoulder belts already are in place for many 1989 models and will be in all required 1990 models. None of the companies would say how much the additional safety measure, ordered Monday by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> for all 1990 hardtop cars, will cost consumers. The Center for Auto Safety in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> estimated that kits for installation of the belts in existing cars cost $ 200 and up. `` We've seen a transition from two decades ago from a period of little or no public acceptance in safety devices to an era where safety is perceived as a plus in most cases and the price of entry in all others,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> offers standard rear lap and shoulder belts on 34 percent of its 1989 cars, including the Taurus and Cougar. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has offeed rear lap and shoulder belts since 1987. They are standard in all but two 1989 <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> models, the full size <ORGANIZATION> Chevrolet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Blazer </ORGANIZATION> and the Geo Spectrum. `` We were well ahead of the rule,'' <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Antonette </PERSON> <PERSON> Simonetti </PERSON> said. She said <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> offers kits allowing installation of the rear shoulder belts, but she could not say how popular they are. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenyon </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said several <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> models have the rear belts for 1989, including the Dodge Shadow-Plymouth Sundance series and the Eagle Summit. `` There is going to have to be some redesign work to accommodate this ruling, but we are looking to have rear shoulder belts for the 1990s,'' <PERSON> Kenyon </PERSON> said. He added that a retroactive installation kit from <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> will be available in August. <PERSON> Debra </PERSON> <PERSON> Barclay </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the Center for Auto Safety in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said the agency has criticized <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> for declining to offer kits for several models between 1978 and 1988. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, which is part of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION>, told the center <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> was within its rights not to offer retroactive rear belt kits for some models. <PERSON> Barclay </PERSON> said anchors for permit installation of rear belts have been on all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cars since 1972. She said consumer awareness of the availability of rear belt kits is limited. Many dealers, she said, are reluctant to offer them because of possible liability in case they do n't protect a back seat passenger in an accident. The prices of the kits often are inflated by dealerships, she said. <PERSON> Simonetti </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s retroactive belt kits cost $ 50 to $ 60. <PERSON> Barclay </PERSON> said kits for older models begin in the $ 200 range and cost up to $ 300 for newer models.

 Grain and soybean futures prices closed higher Tuesday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, supported by a bullish <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> crop report and expectations for drier weather in the Corn Belt. In a report issued after the close of trading Monday, the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> peggged the drought-damaged winter wheat crop at an 11-year-low of 1.41 billion bushels, down 10 percent from last year's harvest and 2 percent below the May forecast. The report gave a boost to the wheat market, but buying enthusiasm was tempered by forecasts for drier-than-normal conditions early next week in the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, which would accelerate the winter wheat harvest. The soybean market regained nearly all of the ground it lost Monday amid talk of warm, dry weather forecast for the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> late this week and through the weekend.

 President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> said Tuesday that renegotiation of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s debt with private banks may take months to complete. As late as last week there was informed speculation that so much progress was being made in the negotiations that a final agreement could be reached in two to three weeks. But in an interview with executives and members of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> said `` there are still weeks, maybe months ahead in the negotiations.'' He said the talks with private banks are the toughest part of the debt renegotiation. `` Banks look at their balance sheets and we have to respond to social pressures,'' he said. Some 500 commercial banks hold about $ 74 billion of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s $ 107.4 billion total foreign debt, which is the second-largest in the developing world after <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> is attempting to renegotiate its bank agreements to cut its payment burden and help revive its economy. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> must cut its debt service from 7 percent to 2 percent of gross domestic product to revive the long-stagnant economy. The president also reiterated his objections that debt-for-equity swaps _ where lenders exchange outstanding debts for equity in local enterprises _ generate inflation and damage the economy. He said <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> wants additional foreign investment and would welcome foreign capital in infrastructure projects including telecommunications, dams and roads. The <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> administration is trying to encourage foreign investment by cutting red tape and opening up new sectors of the economy to foreign capital. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> said he is pleased the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> are supporting <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s efforts to restructure its foreign debt. He said he is `` confident we will arrive at a satisfactory solution'' with the private lenders, `` but it will still take some time.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mexico </ORGANIZATION> has not released any figures on foreign reserves since the end of 1988 but they are believed to be low. Some experts say they will not cover the debt payments coming due in the next few months. `` There is not much time,'' <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> said. The social pressures on the seven-month-old <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> administration are intense. The president said real wages in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> had dropped 50 percent since 1982 and a solution to the debt problem was needed to prevent social unrest. When asked about the use of debt-for-equity swaps, <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> said they lead to `` increasing liquidity in the economy and cause pressure on prices'' leading to greater inflation and the need for increasing government subsidies. `` Inflation is worse than stagnation,'' he said. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>, a Harvard-educated economist, devised <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s successful anti-inflation program while serving as budget minister to his predecessor, <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> While stressing the need for economic growth, <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> said `` growth by itself will not be enough.'' <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> needs `` clean growth'' which respects the environment, he said. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and the country's other major industrial centers are considered to be among the world's most polluted cities.

<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>

 The European Economic Community will soon adopt a single license for banks operating in the 12-nation trading bloc, the European commissioner for financial services said Tuesday. `` We have made enormous progress in the last few days,'' Sir <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Brittan </PERSON> said in a briefing with reporters. <PERSON> Brittan </PERSON> said he expects the regulations, which would allow <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> banks to operate across their borders, to pass within a month. But the licensing proposal has raised controversy because of its so-called reciprocity clause. Some <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> members worried that foreign banks might be excluded from operating in the Community unless <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> banks were given equivalent advantages abroad. Sir <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> amended the proposal earlier this year.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday it has fined two traders a total of $ 175,000 for making improper trades of stock-index futures during the week of the 1987 stock-market crash. The exchange said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carbonaro </PERSON> pre-arranged six separate trades of <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 stock-index futures contracts from Oct. 16 through Oct. 22, 1987. The trades involved a total of 94 contracts for future deliveries of the stocks tracked by the closely watched <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P 500 index. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Spike </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, was fined $ 75,000 and suspended from trading for 20 business days beginning Tuesday. <PERSON> Carbonaro </PERSON>, a floor broker, was fined $ 100,000 and suspended from trading for 30 business days beginning Friday. A receptionist at Spike Trading said <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> was not in. A clerk for <PERSON> Carbonaro </PERSON> said he was too busy to come to the telephone. The penalties follow months of questioning by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> about the futures industry's ability to regulate itself. Scrutiny of the industry has intensified since the revelation in January that an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigation of futures trading in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> was under way. The <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION>'s compliance department reportedly began investigating <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> shortly after the Oct. 19, 1987, stock-market crash. The Wall Street Journal reported Monday that an internal department memo dated Nov. 9, 1987, indicated the exchange launched an investigation because `` during the period October 19-23, 1987, <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> made over $ 2.5 million'' trading stock-index futures. Stock-index futures trading has been singled out as a factor that may have accelerated the stock market's collapse, although futures exchanges have disputed that notion. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> was fined $ 1,500 last November for unbusiness-like conduct in the trading pit. He was fined $ 1,000 in 1984 for `` use of undue force'' while entering or leaving the stock-index futures pit.

<HEAD>Jobs Lands Another Coup With Cannon $100 Million Deal</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Jobs </PERSON> pulled off another coup when he landed a $ 100 million investment for his tiny company, <ORGANIZATION> Next </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, from giant Japanese electronics firm <ORGANIZATION> Canon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, analysts said Tuesday. `` I definitely think that it's an excellent deal for Next,'' said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Lupatkin </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Hambrecht </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Quist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. `` It's an extraordinary valuation that's being paid.'' <ORGANIZATION> Canon </ORGANIZATION>, a manufacturer of camera and office equipment, invested $ 100 million for a 16.67 percent stake in Next, pushing the market value for the 4-year-old <LOCATION> Palo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alto </LOCATION> company to about $ 600 million. The Canon payment, announced Monday, is considered extremely high for a company that still is not shipping its first product in significant volume, something that worried some analysts. `` We have to see how good Next is; it's not clear that they have the winning product,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wu </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> S.G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warburg </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The deal includes a separate agreement under which <ORGANIZATION> Canon </ORGANIZATION> will become the exclusive distributor of Next computer workstations in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and eight other Asian countries, and follows another Jobs coup in March whereby <ORGANIZATION> Businessland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> said it would distribute Next's computers to businesses. `` Obviously, <ORGANIZATION> Businessland </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Canon </ORGANIZATION> are betting that Next will deliver the product,'' said <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Lederman </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Duff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Phelps </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` They're betting that that product will perform to expectations _ and they're betting on <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Jobs </PERSON>.'' Jobs, 34, who co-founded <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> but left following a power struggle in 1985, first displayed Next's sleek black workstation in October, when he offered it for sale to colleges and universities beginning at $ 10,000. He abruptly switched marketing tactics when he decided to include sales to businesses in the deal with <ORGANIZATION> Businessland </ORGANIZATION>, a leading computer retailer with 112 outlets nationwide. The market for workstations _ high-powered desktop computers _ is expected to grow at a 30 percent clip through 1993 for total revenues of about $ 18 billion, according to <ORGANIZATION> Dataquest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, research firm. <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett-Packard </ORGANIZATION>'s recent acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Apollo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> made it the No. 1 player in the workstation market, followed by <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Microsystems </ORGANIZATION>, according to <ORGANIZATION> Dataquest </ORGANIZATION>. Other major players in the workstation market, besides Next, include <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Analysts said the <ORGANIZATION> Canon </ORGANIZATION> deal was impressive because Next did not give <PERSON> Cannon </PERSON> any technology or manufacturing rights, and the additional cash will allow Next to complete its manufacturing facility and begin full production of its computer <ORGANIZATION> Canon </ORGANIZATION> can not expand its stake in Next beyond 20 percent for the next 10 years. Only Jobs, with 50 percent, and Next employees, with 20 percent, have a bigger ownership in the company. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> billionaire <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Perot </PERSON> owns 12.5 percent of Next. <PERSON> Hiroshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanaka </PERSON>, senior managing director of Tokyo-based <ORGANIZATION> Canon </ORGANIZATION>, said Monday that his company made the investment because `` we feel that Next will be the most important Unix workstation company worldwide, and that it is in our mutual interest to do all we can to strengthen our long-term relationship.''

 Executives of big American companies predict <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> will become a more attractive market despite the bloody crackdown on dissenters this month, a poll released Tuesday said. The Fortune 500-CNN Moneyline CEO Poll of 183 chief executives was conducted from May 30 to June 7, bridging the days in which troops cleared <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s Tiananmen Square with tanks and rifles. Of the 116 executives surveyed before the crackdown, 55 percent thought <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> would become a more attractive market, 5 percent thought it would become less attractive, 23 percent thought there would be no change and 17 percent said they were not sure.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today vetoed legislation raising the minimum wage to $ 4.55 an hour, setting up a political battle with the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> majority in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` This bill would increase the minimum wage by an excessive amount and thus stifle the creation of new job opportunities,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in a veto message that ran more than 1,500 words. `` It would damage the employment prospects of our young people and least advantaged citizens,'' he said. `` It would accelerate inflation. It would not help those in poverty. And thus it would fail to properly reflect the thought behind this measure: to help our lowest paid workers.'' House Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> would attempt to override the veto on Thursday and that he would work through the night trying to sway Democrats who voted against the measure when it cleared the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> earlier this year. `` Hope springs eternal,'' was all <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> would say when asked if he had any evidence that he could swing the 30 or so votes <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> would need to pick up in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in order to override a veto. In the unlikely event the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted to override, it still appears that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would emerge victorious. Thirty-five <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> senators have signed a letter pledging to support <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on a veto fight. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said Democrats would quickly advance another minimum wage bill if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> prevails in the veto fight. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is unwilling to accept his approach toward raising the minimum wage, he would examine the possibility of raising the Earned Income Tax Credit to help the working poor. The credit, a portion of which is available for families with incomes up to $ 18,576, is aimed at offsetting part of Social Security taxes paid by the working poor. It can be worth up to $ 874 a year. A family can gain the full benefit even if its tax liability is less than the credit. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had said in advance that he would veto the legislation, and he wasted no time doing so. The bill was received at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> at 1 p.m. EDT, and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> signed the veto message just 55 minutes later, aboard Air Force One en route from <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> to <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>, Neb. The bill sent to the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> called for a $ 4.55 hourly minimum wage by October 1991 while <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> offered to go to $ 4.25 in January 1992. The administration and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> also differ over whether employers should be able to pay newly hired workers a subminimum wage during a training period. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said such a provision is vital to prevent massive job losses and proposed that employers be allowed to pay a subminimum wage to all new workers for up to six months regardless of prior work experience. Democrats initially resisted any such provision but included in their final bill a clause allowing a subminimum to be paid to workers with less than two month's work experience. `` I wish to be clear about this,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in his veto message. `` My difference with the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is not just about 30 cents an hour. It is about hundreds of thousands of jobs that would be preserved by my administration's approach as opposed to those that would be sacrificed under the excessive increase included in this legislation.'' White House aides have been preparing for the veto. Chief of staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> told reporters earlier today in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> that the measure will `` come to the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, hit the wall and bounce back like a rubber ball.'' <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> said with a laugh, `` This may be the first faxed veto in history.'' It was an apparent reference to the legislation being sent via fax machine from the Capitol to the White House. Democratic leaders were caught off guard by the swiftness of the veto. They had called a news conference to ask <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> one last time not to veto the measure and two had printed statements urging <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to reconsider. `` I deeply regret that the president has chosen to veto this bill, so important I think to the millions and millions of working men and women in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> who deserve a living wage,'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> told reporters. Added Senate Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>: `` It is particularly offensive to millions of poor working Americans that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would veto a bill over 30 cents an hour at the same time that he is pushing hard to give a $ 30,000 a year tax cut to the very richest Americans.''

 The stock market finished broadly lower today amid concerns that a robust dollar could undermine corporate profits. A weakening in bond prices acted as a catalyst for the selloff in stocks and encouraged investors to prune their holdings of shares on which they had made substantial profits in recent weeks. Also motivating sellers was a desire to make certain profits before the government reports a string of potentially market-moving economic statistics later this week. Among the reports scheduled for release are ones on April merchandise trade and May industrial production on Thursday and May consumer prices and housing starts on Friday. Wall Street analysts expressed worries about the adverse impact a high-flying dollar might have on earnings of export-oriented and multinational companies. These concerns surfaced despite a pullback in the dollar today. Previously, investors had been concentrating on the benefits a strong dollar could bestow on the stock market by drawing in foreign money. Waves of program selling temporarly hit the market when stock index futures contracts dropped, encouraging arbitragers to buy futures and sell stocks. The impact was limited, however, and share prices managed to bob back up a bit from the lowest levels of the session.

The reduction was automatically triggered by a fall in the organization's indicator price of coffee below $ 1.15 a pound. The price is the absolute floor the 74-nation body seeks to defend by its price-support regime of export quotas, which expires Sept. 30. The coffee organization indicator price Tuesday was $ 1.1463. The organization cut the quota by 350,700 bags, which reduces the global quota allocation for the year October 1988 to September 1989 to 56.87 million bags. One bag equals 132 pounds. It was the third cut in quotas this year and, like the others, affects only producers of the poorer robusta bean. The main burden falls on the <LOCATION> Ivory </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Uganda </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>. The selective application of quota cuts reflects the coffee organization's aim in the 1988-89 year to boost supplies of top-quality arabica produced throughout <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. But quotas of producers of this type will be cut if the price of the grade drops below $ 1.30 a pound from its present level of $ 1.39, the organization said. Negotiations between producing and consuming nations on a one-year extension of the pact allowing prices to be stabilized by supply controls collapsed in confusion early Tuesday. <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, all African producers, the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> backed a proposal at the nine-day talks to extend the pact from Oct. 1, leaving details, such as shares of the global export quota, to be worked out before then. The move was opposed by the 11-nation group of producers of the top-quality and increasingly popular mild arabica coffee, including <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. They proposed that an extension should be conditional on an agreement now that they would receive a bigger slice of the export quota market than at present. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the biggest coffee consuming nation, supported the proposal. The nations agreed to hold a one-day session here July 3 to vote on the two proposals, delegates said. Unless many nations change position, both proposals are expected to be rejected, they said. In that event, the coffee organization is expected to extend the present pact without its powers to regulate supplies and prices, said the head of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> delegation, <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Roerig </PERSON>. Traders fear that producing countries will ignore coffee organization sales limits before Oct. 1 if no export quotas are adopted. Analysts said there are ample world supplies of coffee beans despite two consecutive poor Brazilian crops. Huge stocks of coffee are also believed to be held in European warehouses.

<TEXT>
 One of the 11 authors hired by <ORGANIZATION> Whittle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> to write brief hardcover books that will contain advertising said Tuesday he has withdrawn from the project because of editorial interference. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Epstein </PERSON> had been signed to write a book about <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, the former <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> executive who was a pioneer in developing the junk bond market. The book was one of several that Whittle plans to publish in what it is tentatively calling its `` Larger Agenda'' series for distribution to government and corporate leaders. The books will run about 100 pages each and be sponsored by a single company which Whittle has refused to identify. However, <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> has confirmed it intends to be a sponsor of the books. <PERSON> Epstein </PERSON> recently submitted an outline of his book, but said Whittle editor <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiser </PERSON> expressed concern about whether <PERSON> Whittle </PERSON>'s audience would like the line of argument he was advancing. The author said he `` did n't feel comfortable with the kinds of editorial suggestions being made by the editorial director there.'' He declined to go into what was being suggested and said he had no way of knowing the reasons for demanding the changes. But <PERSON> Epstein </PERSON> said he had never run into such problems in writing 11 other books with six different publishing companies in which no advertiser was involved in the project. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Rukeyser </PERSON>, editor-in-chief at <ORGANIZATION> Whittle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION>, said the advertiser had nothing to do with suggestions about <PERSON> Epstein </PERSON>'s book outline `` It was entirely an editorial process,'' said <PERSON> Rukeyser </PERSON>, a former managing editor at Fortune magazine, adding he was `` outraged'' anyone would suggest an advertiser was interfering. `` He seemed to be proposing a book that would take the view that <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>'s overall effect on the economy has been so healthy, the fact that he may have committed felonies did n't matter. We felt that was not an intellectually or morally viable stance for the book to to take,'' he said. <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> has been indicted on federal securities fraud charges and could face a trial next year. <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> spokeaman <PERSON> Armand </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> said from <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> that the company has `` no editorial control over the books.'' `` The content is up to <LOCATION> Whittle </LOCATION>. We know the names of the authors and the working titles, but that's all,'' he said. <PERSON> Rukeyser </PERSON> said he did not think <PERSON> Epstein </PERSON>'s withdrawal from the project would affect Whittle's broader plans for single-advertiser books. Whittle disclosed earlier this year it signed book contracts with nine authors including <PERSON> Epstein </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Galbraith </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Halberstam </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, which disclosed <PERSON> Epstein </PERSON>'s withdrawal from the project in Tuesday's editions, said <PERSON> Halberstam </PERSON> and another project author, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Atlas </PERSON>, told the newspaper they had not experienced any interference in their books. <PERSON> Rukeyser </PERSON> said two more authors he declined to identify have since been signed. The first book could appear later this year with additional books expected in 1990.

 Central banks helped push the dollar lower Tuesday as the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government reported the deficit in its broadest measure of foreign trade worsened dramatically in early 1989. The trade deficit did not directly contribute to the weakness in the dollar because the figures had been expected. But some economists believe the huge gap in trade inevitably will halt the dollar's early-summer rally. `` I do n't believe this dollar rally can be sustained for more than a few weeks, more than a month or two,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Americans are buying far more from overseas than they sell to foreign customers. That can continue only while foreigners are willing to pile up credits in the form of loans and investments in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the deficit in the current account jumped 7 percent in the first quarter after falling the two previous quarters. The current account covers merchandise trade as well as trade in services, primarily investment income. The dollar fell against all major currencies except the British pound, which was weakened by speculation of a rift between Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> and her top economic official, Chancellor of the Exchequer <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>. The pound finished the European trading day at its lowest level against the dollar in more than two years, although action by the Bank of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and a statement by Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> supporting <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> raised it from its lowest levels. There were reports of dollar sales by the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> intervened five times, according to <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Adkins </PERSON>, a currency analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Refco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the pound slipped to $ 1.5162 late Tuesday. That was the pound's lowest rate against the dollar since February 1987. Late Monday, sterling cost $ 1.5250. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the pound traded at $ 1.5270, down from $ 1.5285 on Monday. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar rose 0.30 yen to a closing 148.70 yen. Later in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar was quoted at 149.15 yen. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the dollar fell to 147.75 yen from 148.46 yen on Monday. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late Monday's rates, included: 2.0140 West German marks, down from 2.0195; 1.7385 Swiss francs, down from 1.7470; 1.1997 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2011; 6.8270 French francs, down from 6.8420; and 1,455.50 Italian lire, down from 1,460.00 Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Monday's rates, included: 2.0260 West German marks, up from 2.0250; 1.7520 Swiss francs, down from 1.7550; 6.8675 French francs, up from 6.8620; 2.2758 Dutch guilders, down from 2.2835; 1,459.25 Italian lire, down from 1,463.50; 1.2007 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2024 Gold prices rose in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> trading after having been mixed abroad. In <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold rose $ 2.63 a troy ounce to close at a bid of $ 361.66.

On the Commodity Exchange in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, gold bullion for current delivery rose to $ 363.10 an ounce from $ 361.90 on Monday. Later, <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> said gold was bid at $ 362.20 as of 4 p.m. EDT, up from $ 360.70 late Monday.

 The stock market moved broadly lower Tuesday, depressed by concerns about the adverse consequences of a recently robust dollar. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials finished with a loss of 15.30 points at 2,503.54. In nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, losers swamped gainers by a margin of about 2 to 1, with 1,014 down, 503 up and 483 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 164.87 million shares, up from 151.46 million in the previous session. <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, chief investment officer at <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Albany </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said a weakening in long-term <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bond prices acted as a catalyst for the selloff in stocks and encouraged investors to prune their holdings of shares on which they had made substantial profits in recent weeks. Also motivating sellers Tuesday was a desire to collect their profits before the government reports a string of potentially market-moving economic statistics later this week. Reports on merchandise trade in April and industrial production in May are due Thursday. On Friday, reports for May on consumer prices and housing starts will be issued. Despite a pullback in the dollar Tuesday, Wall Street analysts expressed worries that the dollar's recent strength against foreign currencies could impair the profitability of many American companies that rely on revenue from overseas sales. A strong dollar makes <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports more expensive on markets abroad. The pharmaceuticals concern <ORGANIZATION> Pfizer </ORGANIZATION> partly blamed the dollar's appreciation for an expected 30 percent to 40 percent decline in its second-quarter earnings Disclosure of the disappointing estimate late Monday led <ORGANIZATION> Pfizer </ORGANIZATION> stock to plunge 3 -LRB- to 58 in heavy trading Tuesday. Other drug companies took a cue from <ORGANIZATION> Pfizer </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Syntex </ORGANIZATION> slid 1 -LCB- to 50 -RCB-, <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beckman </ORGANIZATION> fell 1 -LRB- to 61 -RRB-, <ORGANIZATION> Marion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> shed -RCB- to 25 \, <PERSON> Warner </PERSON> <PERSON> Lambert </PERSON> tumbled 2 -RRB- to 89 and <PERSON> Merck </PERSON> dropped 2 -LRB- to 68 -RCB- and contributed to the decline in the Dow Jones industrial average Among other blue chips, <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> jumped 2 -LRB- to 111 as more than 2 million shares changed hands on news that an investment firm had confirmed its buy recommendation. Stocks confronting takeover situations continued to figure prominently in the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s lineup of actively traded issues. Time rose 5 to 180 as reports circulated that <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> might enter the bidding for the publishing giant. GE led the actives' list, closing with a loss of -RCB-, at 53 -LCB-. Time is fighting a hostile $ 175-per-share buyout bid from <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> in an attempt to preserve a planned stock swap merger with <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION>. Paramount rose -RCB- to 57 -RCB- and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> closed off \ at 54 \ Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 193.36 million shares. As measured by <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>' index of more than 5,000 actively traded stocks, the market lost $ 21.19 billion, or 0.66 percent, in value. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks fell 1.20 to 180.94. <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's industrial index dropped 2.49 to 370.72, and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P's 500-stock composite index finished at 323.91, off 2.33.

<HEAD>Coffee Futures Plunge Continues on Failed ICO Meeting</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Coffee futures prices dropped to a 10-month low Tuesday amid fears the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coffee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>'s failure to forge a new price-support pact could leave unroasted coffee free to fall to as low as $ 1 a pound. On other markets, orange juice futures rose sharply; grains and soybeans advanced; petroleum futures were mixed; precious metals gained; and livestock and meat futures were mixed. Coffee futures settled 4.75 cents to 9.46 cents lower on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Coffee, <ORGANIZATION> Sugar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> with the contract for delivery in July at $ 1.1538, the lowest close since Aug. 8, 1988. The price of coffee for July delivery in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> has dropped more than 11 percent since Friday. The loss of nearly 9 -LCB- cents Tuesday was nearly twice as large as the decline posted Monday, when it became apparent the world's largest coffee producer - and consumer-nations would end their nine-day meeting in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> without an agreement to replace the six-year pact that expires on Oct. `` This has to be seen as follow-through from yesterday's selling,'' said <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevenson </PERSON>, a coffee-market analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coffee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> attempts to control coffee prices by limiting exports of green, unroasted coffee from producer members to consumer members of the 74-nation body. One of the major stumbling blocks in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> was a demand by some of the leading consumer nations, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, for tighter restrictions on sales of coffee to non-ICO member nations such as the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> at prices below those charged to member nations. Traders fear that without a price-support mechanism, coffee will flood the market and prices will collapse. `` People are really talking up the $ 1 level,'' said <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaul </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> analyst in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. But she said the futures market may have overreacted to the failed <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> meeting, noting that coffee inventories are relatively low and that <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, the world's largest coffee is entering its cold-weather season. A damaging freeze in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> could turn the market around in a hurry. Representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coffee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> will meet again July 3. No negotiations toward a new agreement are expected at that meeting, but members could vote to extend the current pact. Frozen concentrated orange juice futures rallied strongly on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cotton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> following five straight days of pronounced weakness. Analysts called the runup a technical correction to an oversold condition. Orange juice settled .75 cent to 6.95 cents higher with July at $ 1.8025 a pound. Grain and soybean futures advanced on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, supported by a bullish <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> crop report and expectations for drier weather in the Corn Belt. Wheat settled -RCB- cent to 3 -RCB- cents higher with July at $ 3.92 \ a bushel; corn was 1 -LCB- cents to 3 -LCB- cents higher with July at $ 2.52 -LCB- a bushel; oats were 3 cents to 3 -LCB- cents higher with July at $ 1.61 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were 4 -LCB- cents to 10 cents higher with July at $ 7.01 a bushel Crude oil for July delivery advanced slightly on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> but most other petroleum futures retreated amid signs of discord among <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 25 cents lower to 8 cents higher with July at $ 19.34 a barrel; heating oil was .60 cent to .87 cent lower with July at 44.58 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was 1.81 cents lower to .22 cent higher with July at 59.92 cents a gallon. Precious metals inched higher on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where gold settled $ 1 to $ 1.90 higher with August at $ 366.80 a troy ounce; silver was 2 cents to 2.5 cents higher with July at $ 5.25 a troy ounce. On the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, live cattle were .23 cent lower to .43 cent higher with June at 70.65 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .10 cent higher with August at 80.75 cents a pound; live hogs were .55 cent lower to .08 cent higher with June at 47.65 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .18 cent lower to .92 cent higher with July at 34.52 cents a pound.

 <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> wo n't say what rocked its `` Ready to Roll'' game, but the food giant may have to explain in court how more than 100 people wound up with winning game pieces for a `` one and only'' $ 17,000 grand prize. `` We've declared the game null and void. We're still evaluating what our next step will be,'' <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Knuth </PERSON>, spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> Kraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday at the company's suburban <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> offices `` We're telling people who've matched the pieces to go ahead and mail them in, but we do n't know what we'll do,'' she said. `` Obviously we feel very badly about the situation.'' Apparently not as badly as some of <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON>'s customers, who filed a class-action lawsuit Tuesday in <ORGANIZATION> Cook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. A promotional insert in Sunday newspapers in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> areas carried the right half of four game pieces for `` Ready to Roll.'' Specially marked packages of <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> cheese contained a left half, and matched pairs could be redeemed for one of 8,000 free packages of cheese; one of 500 skateboards; one of 100 bicycles; or, at odds of 15 million-to-1, a 1990 Dodge Caravan LE. `` The problem is that instead of there being a limited number of winners, almost all of the game pieces that went out with the cheese had winning pieces of one kind r another,'' said <PERSON> Knuth </PERSON>. She would not say who put the game together. Attorney <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> DeGroot </PERSON>, whose firm filed the lawsuit Tuesday, declined to discuss it. His law firm filed a class-action lawsuit three years ago when a mistake caused <ORGANIZATION> Beatrice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION> to cancel a promotion, and won a $ 2 million settlement for 2,400 players. `` I'd be willing to go to court, if only because I had to go into the garbage can to get mine,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON>, a dissatisfied customer who is not named in the lawsuit. He explained that his 7-year-old son, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON>, loves contests and his wife, <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON>, had thrown out the game piece that came with the cheese to hide it from <PERSON> Richard </PERSON>. `` But we were looking through the paper Sunday and she realized she had the matching half.

Almost immediately, <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> began recalling all the specially marked packages from store shelves in both the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> areas. <PERSON> Knuth </PERSON> declined to reveal any details about the promotion, other than to say the company's position is that it can not be held liable for the error. `` It is so obviously unintentional,'' she said. But the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> attorney general's office already has heard from 50 angry customers, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Therese </PERSON> <PERSON> McMahon </PERSON>. And a private attorney who already has been contacted by one winner says the company `` may not be able to say, ` Oops,' and forget about it.'' `` In breach-of-contract matters like this, you can defend yourself by saying the error was so obvious that the person who benefits from it should know,'' said attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Magee </PERSON>. `` I'm not sure that will wash in this instance, especially in front of a jury.'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Blashek </PERSON>, executive vice president for <ORGANIZATION> Ventura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, a New York-based contest, sweepstakes and game-planning service, rated the <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> mixup `` pretty bad as these things go.'' `` But on the scale of foulups,'' he added, `` I've heard of worse. The difference is that most of those do n't reach the public.''

<HEAD>Gasoline, Heating Oil Futures Decline; Crude Prices Edge Upward</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Prices for gasoline and heating oil futures slipped Tuesday, partly reflecting trader fear of an increase in stockpiles of petroleum products. The fear turned out to be unfounded, however. After the close of trading, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> reported stockpiles of crude oil, gasoline and other refined products all fell in the week ended Friday. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, wholesale unleaded gasoline for July delivery fell 1.81 cents a gallon to 59.92 cents after sliding 1.99 cents on Monday. Wholesale home heating oil for July delivery dropped 0.87 cent to 44.58 cents a gallon after a 1.58-cent decline Monday. Crude oil for July delivery edged up 8 cents to $ 19.34 a barrel after falling 62 cents on Monday. However, subsequent contract months moved lower Tuesday. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Lebow </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> E.D. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Man </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said the downward momentum of Monday carried over into Tuesday, partly over fear of what the API stockpile report would say. The market had expected the report to indicate an increase in gas and heating oil, he said. But the <ORGANIZATION> API </ORGANIZATION> said crude stocks fell 2.91 million barrels to 341.94 million barrels last week, gasoline stocks fell 941,000 barrels to 220.13 million barrels, and other distillates fell 423,000 barrels to 98.89 million barrels.

 The <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> nuclear power plant began its first atomic chain reaction Tuesday, a pivotal event for a $ 6 billion project vexed by years of delays, cost overruns and protests that made it a focus of the nation's anti-nuclear movement. <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> operators began a sustained nuclear fission reaction in the plant's 100 tons of uranium fuel at 5:23 p.m., plant officials said. Completed in July 1986, <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> received its federal low-power license on May 26, a day after a federal appeals court declined to block the tests. Three faulty safety valves delayed initial atomic operations by about a week. Final preparations for the first fission reaction resumed Monday. Then plant operators withdrew control rods from the reactor's fuel core and slowly began diluting the boron concentration in the reactor coolant water Boron absorbs neutrons, preventing them from striking and splitting uranium atoms to release more neutrons, triggering a chain reaction. <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> originally was planned for commercial operation in 1979. A twin reactor was abandoned, 25 percent complete. Both reactors initially were to have cost less than $ 1 billion. Protests since construction began in 1976 have resulted in more than 3,200 arrests, including 734 arrests in two days of civil disobedience earlier this month. Low-power tests must be completed successfully before a nuclear power plant may operate commercially. But before <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> may win its full-power license, it also must gain final approval for evacuation plans for crowded nearby beaches and communities up to 10 miles away. <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> has six communities within 10 miles of <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> but refuses to cooperate, saying evacuation of the area is not feasible. Federal hearings are underway on evacuation plans <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> has developed for <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. Federal regulators say approved evacuation plans are not needed for low-power operation because the tests pose minuscule safety risks. <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON>'s owners also may have to prove they are financially qualified to run the plant commercially. Lead owner <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> is under federal bankruptcy protection, and some of the other 11 <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> utilities with <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> shares also face financial problems. But the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> ruled in December that those troubles pose no safety problem for low-power tests as long as the owners posted a bond to pay to decommission the reactor after the tests should it never operate commercially. Owners posted the bond last month. Critics had argued that <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> should not be allowed to start the tests and become contaminated by radioactive materials before commercial operation is assured and dumps are available for the plant's nuclear waste. Plant officials maintained that contamination would be minimal outside the reactor vessel. However, with the start of a fission reaction, spent uranium fuel would be classified as high-level radioactive waste. Political and technical problems have delayed construction of a national high-level nuclear dump, while <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> has been shut out of the nation's three low-level dumps because it has not met federal deadlines for becoming responsible for its own radioactive waste.

<HEAD>Consumer Group Predicts Higher Prices, Possible Gas Lines</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Motorists will see a new round of gasoline price rises this summer, and a supply squeeze that could lead to gas lines reminiscent of the 1970s, a consumer group said Tuesday. A report on the summer gasoline outlook by Buyers Up, a division of the advocacy group <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizen </ORGANIZATION>, painted a grim picture for motorists and called on federal authorities to investigate the oil companies for possible price collusion. `` We could see spot shortages in the form of gas lines by the beginning of August,'' said <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON>, director of research for Buyers Up and chief author of the report. <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON> said gasoline prices at the pump could rise as much as 10 cents a gallon by the end of the summer, adding to a price spiral this spring that triggered calls on Capitol Hill for the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to investigate oil company pricing tactics. The <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and many independent analysts said gasoline prices are not likely to rise more than 4 or 5 cents a gallon this summer, in part because of a recent decline in prices for the crude oil from which gasoline is refined. The government said it expects no shortages barring a major disruption of supplies. The oil industry's main trade group, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, issued a statement challenging the Buyers Up predictions. `` We are confident that gasoline supplies from both domestic and foreign refineries will be adequate to meet the nation's needs this summer,'' the institute said. `` Barring some unforeseen crisis that affects supplies, we do not anticipate a shortage of gasoline or a return of lines at retail outlets.'' Prices jumped by about 15 cents a gallon following the March 24 <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> oil spill in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, which caused a brief squeeze on oil supplies to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. The industry blamed the price rise on normal seasonal increases in gasoline demand, new environmental standards for gasoline and higher crude oil prices. In the lengthy report on the gasoline situation, Buyers Up said a supply squeeze is likely because oil refiners will be unable to meet growing demand for fuel. This is due to a combination of factors, including oil company efforts to sell more high-octane gasoline, which result in less gasoline produced per barrel of oil. The group also cited inadequate surplus stocks and a likelihood that imports will be more limited than in the past, mainly because of production constraints in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` Even an optimistic assessment of the situation raises the possibility of gas lines this summer,'' said <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Claybrook </PERSON>, president of Public Citizen. The report said gasoline supplies would be the tightest since the energy crisis of the 1970s despite relatively abundant world oil supplies. The authors called for increased regulation of the oil industry and called on the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to investigate possible `` illicit oil company cooperation'' to limit domestic supplies of gasoline.

 Engines that run on a mixture of fuels could help the country switch from gasoline to the methanol auto fuel advocated by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for helping cut air pollution, engineers at a <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> seminar said Tuesday. Automakers have been testing methanol-fueled vehicles for about 10 years, but the cars have relatively short driving ranges and fuel availability generally is limited to cities where test programs are in effect, said <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Buist </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s director of automotive emissions and fuel economy. A `` flexible fuel system'' that could burn methanol, gasoline, or any mix of the two could make it easier to find fuel, which also would ease consumer worriers about buying a methanol-powered car and being unable to use or sell it anywhere but cities experimenting with that fuel, engineers said. Included in the broad environmentalpackage <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced Monday is a phased-in requirement for auto manufacturers to produce alternatives to gasoline-powered autos in the nine major urban areas with the worst smog problems. Gasoline emits nitrous oxides that are an ingredient in the ozone that causes smog. Methanol emits less carbon monoxide than gasoline but produces formaldehyde and other poisons. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s current methanol testing program includes a 700-car fleet in smoggy <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. Methanol has about half the energy content as the same volume of gasoline, so `` the driver's going to have to refuel twice as often,'' <PERSON> Buist </PERSON> said. It was unclear how commercially-produced methanol's cost would compare with gasoline, he said. Methanol, an alcohol derived from natural gas, coal or wood, also is more corrosive than gasoline, so engineers must develop fuel systems that can withstand it. Rewards will include some increase in performance along with the lower emissions of smog-forming pollutants, the <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> engineers said. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kulp </PERSON>, another in a group of <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> officials holding a seminar for reporters on environmental and energy issues, said a multi-fuel system would have a sensor that measures the methanol-gasoline mix. The sensor would be connected to the car's engine-control computer, which adjusts spark timing and the flow of fuel. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has a `` variable fuel control'' system designed to do the same thing on a fleet of 2,220 cars being supplied to the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> for a methanol demonstration program. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> also will supply 2,000 to 2,500 cars with similar fuel controls for testing in a planned two-year program in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> area, said <PERSON> Buist </PERSON>, who serves on an advisory panel on alternative fuels in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>.

Executives of the two concerns said the deal would result in operating efficiencies that will improve profitability and enable the resulting company to serve its clients better. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> Prudential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> and its <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> unit, said the deal `` underscores our commitment to the retail securities business,'' which has sagged since the October 1987 stock market crash. The companies plan to merge the domestic retail brokerage operations of <PERSON> Thomson </PERSON> <PERSON> McKinnon </PERSON> with those of <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> into a retail brokerage arm to be called Prudential-Bache-Thomson. <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> said in an interview that the new brokerage would compete with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> for ranking as the nation's third-largest brokerage concern behind those run by <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co The proposed transaction was announced jointly by <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> and by <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive of <ORGANIZATION> Thomson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> McKinnon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, who will become a vice chairman of the combined firm. <ORGANIZATION> Prudential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> is owned by the <ORGANIZATION> Prudential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Thomson </PERSON> <PERSON> McKinnon </PERSON> is privately held, owned by its management, its <ORGANIZATION> Employee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ownership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> and by the <ORGANIZATION> Hartford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> unit of <ORGANIZATION> ITT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. In a separate development, <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> said it had agreed to sell its 23 percent stake in <PERSON> Thomson </PERSON> <PERSON> McKinnon </PERSON> to the securities firm in advance of the <ORGANIZATION> Prudential </ORGANIZATION> deal. <ORGANIZATION> Prudential </ORGANIZATION> agreed under terms of its agreement to acquire the outstanding <ORGANIZATION> Thomson </ORGANIZATION> shares from the <ORGANIZATION> Thomson </ORGANIZATION> management and the employee trust. The statement said the price could not be stated because it is subject to adjustments and earnings through the closing date. The deal is subject to a due diligence review and regulatory approvals. The employee trust and <ORGANIZATION> Prudential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> will each have about a 28.5 percent interest in the <ORGANIZATION> Thomson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> McKinnon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asset </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> LP </ORGANIZATION>, 57 percent of which is currently owned by <PERSON> Thomson </PERSON> <PERSON> McKinnon </PERSON>. The partnership operates <PERSON> Thomson </PERSON>'s money and investment management business. The partnership went public in 1987 and its limited partnership units, which comprise the remaining ownership, will continue to trade on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> said in an interview that the retail securities business `` is very unpopular now'' but that prospects are `` brighter than they have ever been in the past.'' The combined firm will `` be in position to prosper substantially as times do get better,'' he said. He said the short-term catalyst for the deal was to cut down on overhead costs by allowing the two firms to share <ORGANIZATION> Prudential </ORGANIZATION>'s transaction processing operation `` This is going to help profitability in a period of drought in the retail business,'' he said. A longer-term benefit, <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> said, would be increased capacity to create new products, capture market share and advertise in a way that would help brokers and clients at both firms. The new firm will have about 20,000 employees and $ 1.3 billion in capital, the companies said. <PERSON> Thomson </PERSON> <PERSON> McKinnon </PERSON>, established in 1885, claims to be the 9th largest retail brokerage network with 154 offices worldwide and about 4,700 employees, including 2,000 retail brokers. <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> currently ranks fourth among the brokerages with over 320 retail, commodity, investment banking and institutional sales offices worldwide and more than 16,000 employees, including over 6,000 retail brokers.

 A <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> judge Tuesday upheld a July 26 shareholder meeting for <ORGANIZATION> Prime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, denying a request by <ORGANIZATION> MAI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Basic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Four </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> to force its takeover target to hold its annual meeting Wednesday. Meanwhile, Prime, which is attempting to thwart the MAI Basic takeover bid by finding a friendly buyer, reported in court documents it is `` currently in discussions with several Fortune 500-size companies and two well-established leverage buy-out firms.'' The document said companies with which Prime is negotiating have asked that their identities remain secret. In his decision Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> Chancery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartnett </PERSON> 3rd rejected MAI Basic's argument that <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> law compelled Prime to hold a shareholders meeting every 13 months. The <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> computer company had said the law compelled Prime to hold the meeting Wednesday. <PERSON> Hartnett </PERSON>'s five-page decision said the directors had sufficient reason to postpone the meeting until July. In a letter to the court, MAI Basic attorney <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON> said Prime's move to postpone the meeting was a `` deliberate attempt by the Prime board to prevent us from completing our offer.'' <PERSON> Hartnett </PERSON> said MAI Basic, which is controlled by investor <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> LeBow </PERSON>, had failed to submit sufficient evidence to support that allegation. Prime, in a statement from its <LOCATION> Natick </LOCATION> headquarters late Tuesday, said the directors had postponed the meeting `` in order to permit the stockholders to evaluate the new and much less attractive offer from Basic and in order to give the directors reasonable time to find alternatives to Basic's new offer.'' On June 1, <LOCATION> Tustin </LOCATION>, Calif.-based MAI Basic lowered its original $ 20-per-share cash offer to $ 19.50 per share for 75 percent of Prime's stock, and notes for the remaining 25 percent.

 Domino's <ORGANIZATION> Pizza </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> founder and owner <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Monaghan </PERSON> has resigned as president of the fast food empire, saying he wants to serve the church instead of serving up more than $ 2 billion worth of pizza a year. <PERSON> Monaghan </PERSON> told thousands of Domino's employees via closed-circuit television Monday that he would remain chairman and chief executive officer, but was relinquishing the presidency. `` I love the day-to-day work at Domino's, but I want to serve the church more,'' said <PERSON> Monaghan </PERSON>, 52. `` I always wanted to be a priest.'' <PERSON> Monaghan </PERSON>, who owns the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> baseball team and is known for his collection of classic cars and devotion to architect <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, holds 97.5 percent of Domino's stock. But said he would consider selling the company if the transaction benefited Domino's <ORGANIZATION> Pizza </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, which runs <PERSON> Monaghan </PERSON>'s philanthropic efforts. The foundation supports a Roman Catholic missionary priest in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Monaghan </PERSON> has dispatched planeloads of dentists, doctors and medical supplies. `` We're building dams, teaching farming, setting up a medical clinic and spreading the gospel,'' said <PERSON> Monaghan </PERSON>, who spent his childhood in a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> orphanage and attended a Grand Rapids seminary. He also founded Legatus, a group of <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> business executives who monitor business ethics. <PERSON> Monaghan </PERSON> said he plans to devote more time to Legatus and to other church-related activities. <PERSON> Monaghan </PERSON> said he will concentrate on long-range planning and leave daily responsibilities to <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, 40, the company's new president after eight years as vice president of operations. The last time <PERSON> Monaghan </PERSON> turned over Domino's reins was in 1975, when <PERSON> Leroy </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> was named president. <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> did n't last long in the job. `` It just did n't work out,'' said <PERSON> Monaghan </PERSON>, adding that he believed it was a mistake to hire an outsider.

 The House will test the possibility of raising taxes to cover $ 100 billion savings and loan losses as an alternative to borrowing the money. Up to now, the only live alternatives being considered for financing the bailout had been swelling the federal deficit or a complex high-cost off-budget bond scheme proposed by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. With the S & amp; L bill scheduled to reach the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor on Wednesday after four months of work, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rules </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday agreed to let lawmakers vote on three financing alternatives as well as separate measures to weaken and toughen <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposed regulatory reforms. Efforts to pay for the bailout through a tax increase or massive cuts in domestic spending programs were defeated soundly in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and were never even formally considered by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. And administration officials have repeatedly vowed to recommend that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> veto the bill if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> adopted anything other than his proposal to finance the $ 50 billion immediate taxpayer share of the cleanup through 30-year private bonds. In a statement issued soon after the Rules Committee action, <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said, `` We strongly urge the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to reject any amendments that would weaken the capital standards. Only tangible captial _ real, hard cash _ provides the deposit insurance fund and the taxpayers with protection necessary to ensure a thrift crisis never happens again.'' And on-budget borrowing to pay for the bailout `` is a grave mistake and will affect markets. In addition the administration's plan is the best method to lock up the thrift industry contribution. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, citing a potential $ 4.5 billion savings in lower interest costs to taxpayers over the next 30 years, wants to make <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> borrow the money directly through the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> but exempt the new debt from Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction targets. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> and other administration officials have vigorously opposed that, saying it would open the door for allowing other needs such as cleaning up nuclear wastes and the war on drugs to swell the deficit and eventually force a tax increase. Under the Rules Committee's action Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members will get to vote on rejecting <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan in favor of borrowing the money directly through the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>. But there also will be a vote on an amendment by Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> LaFalce </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, on refusing to exempt the bailout costs from the budget balancing targets. `` If we adopt the LaFalce amendment, we're going to have to raise taxes or cut spending,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION> `` I do n't think it's going to pass but at least we'll get a good, fair debate on the issue. House Republican Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and administration officials have conceded that they expect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s financing scheme to go down to defeat on a partisan vote in the House. But with <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democrats falling 12 votes short of what was needed to kill it in April, the administration has hopes of prevailing when <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiators meet later to iron out differences in the two versions of the bill. What remains uncertain is whether <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s call for making some 450 marginally healthy thrifts put up $ 6 billion new capital over the next five years will survive without a major loophole _ so-called supervisory good will. The administration and the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democratic leadership have agreed on graudally phasing out the `` good will'' exemptions from capital requirements over the next five years. This allows <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls to count intangible assets such as customer allegiance, name recognition and the like as if they had a cash value. However, all but about a dozen of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s 175 Republicans as well as several Democrats from districts with <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls that would have difficulty coming up with the money were alligned on the other side. House Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., claimed support for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s tough capital approach was sufficient to defeat weakening amendments by Reps. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>., and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Quillen </PERSON>, But Rep. <PERSON> Chalmers </PERSON> <PERSON> Wylie </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, the ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and one of the few <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> members alligned with Democrats in supporting <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s approach, said the industry `` has someone in from every member's district'' in its lobbying effort against the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposals. <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the agency that will be responsible for cleaning up the S & amp; L problems, said the administration may `` lose some ground but they're not going to lose the fight'' on the capital issue Figures released Tuesday by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, the industry's main regulator, show that the nation's 2,938 S & amp; Ls actually have more `` good will'' exemptions from the capital requirements than actual tangible capital invested in their businesses.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> announced pay raises of up to 50 percent for public employees on Tuesday and accused businessmen of fueling inflation by speculating in dollars. Taxicab drivers stopped work on Tuesday in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> and three other major cities _ <PERSON> Leon </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Granada </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Masaya </PERSON> _ to protest government measures that doubled the price of gasoline and devalued the national currency by half. The austerity measures by the leftist Sandinista government were aimed at combating inflation. The cabbies, who steered clear of calling their action a strike, formed a panel that started negotiations with government officials over a list of demands. On Monday, <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> ordered the sharpest currency devaluation so far this year, causing prices to skyrocket. The 52 percent devaluation brought down the cordoba, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s currency, from 9,500 to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar Friday to 20,000 per dollar on Monday. That kicked off a massive rise in prices for everything, from food and transportation to clothing, services and entertainment. Food prices doubled and markets emptied. Cab drivers doubled their fares but found few takers. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said Tuesday that <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> will have to import basic foods in June and July, and will further restrict the financing of investments. He had announced on Monday a 110 percent rise in the price of gasoline _ from 17,700 cordobas a gallon to 37,200 cordobas. The president said then there would be no further devaluations in the <LOCATION> cordoba </LOCATION> this month. He also said he hoped to halt black market speculation in dollars that he said fuels inflation. Bus fares on routes within <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> went up from 500 to 750 Cordobas overnight and dozens of people on Tuesday hitched rides from private car owners saying they could n't afford the new fares. Most cabs emptied after the fares doubled. Sales also dropped in food markets after prices shot up following the devaluation. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said the nation's 43,000 public school teachers and health workers will get a 50 percent pay raise to make up for losses to inflation. Teachers also will receive a 14 percent increase that <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> promised May 20 after several schools were shut down by wildcat strikes. An additional 87,000 government employees will receive a 36 percent pay raises, retroactive to June 1, <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said. Speaking on government television, <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said businessmen were fueling cost of living increases by speculating in dollars. `` Over these last few weeks a great deal of money has been moving in the speculative markets. And over the last few days there has been a massive withdrawal of savings in order to speculate,'' he said. Inflation was 15.5 percent in May. The cost of living rose 20,000 percent last year. The government has said that an austerity program launched in January has checked hyperinflation. But the program also brought a recession. <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, traditionally a food exporter to the rest of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, will have to import basic foods such as tomatoes, onions, bananas and cabbages in June and July to make up for domestic shortages, <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said. To stimulate production, the government has been giving financial incentives to agricultural producers, who began their seasonal plantings in May. But lack of rain destroyed seeds already planted and many fields had to be planted again, an extra expense the economy can ill afford.

<HEAD>Boeing Recommends Grounding Certain 737-400s</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737-400 jets similar to those involved in two recent engine failures should be grounded for engine modifications, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and engine manufacturer <ORGANIZATION> CFM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> recommended Tuesday. On Monday, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> grounded all 12 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737-400s operated by British airlines after two of the jets experienced engine failure. On Tuesday, West German officials ordered that the engines be checked on the four 737-400 jets used in that country. The jets all are powered by by CFM56-3C engines, made by <ORGANIZATION> CFM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, a consortium of <ORGANIZATION> SNECMA </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> was preparing an airworthiness directive instructing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines to inspect the fan blades on engines in their <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737-400s and to operate them at a lower power thrust, <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Duff </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, confirmed Monday. That directive was expected to be issued by mid-week. Recommendations from <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> and the engine manufacturer include replacing fan blades and lowering the maximum thrust to 22,000 pounds from 23,500 pounds that current CFM56-3C engines provide, a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> statement said. The recommendation affects 29 CFM56-3C-powered jets outside the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and five in this country. All five of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> jets are operated by <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement was not made to try to head off the expected <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> directive, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said. `` We have been working very closely with the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> as well as with <ORGANIZATION> CFM </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said. `` The CFM56-3C engine problems result when fan blades break at a very high rpm, scattering parts into the engine,'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said. The engine failures on the British jets involved damage to fan blades. The same model engine and plane also were involved in a fatal crash in January in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. On Friday, a Dan-Air 737-400 carrying 100 charter passengers to <ORGANIZATION> Minorca </ORGANIZATION> returned to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Gatwick </LOCATION> airport after developing severe vibration in one engine. On Sunday, a <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Midlands </LOCATION> 737-400 flying from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> airport to <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, with 80 people aboard made an emergency landing at <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Midlands </LOCATION> airport after a problem developed in one engine In both cases, the airlines reported that turbofan blades had been damaged. Questions about the CFM56-3C engine arose in January after the crash of a <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Midlands </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737-400 at <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Midlands </LOCATION> airport that killed 47 people. The pilot had reported that one engine failed in flight, but investigators later found the plane's good engine had been shut down before the emergency landing was attempted. The investigation has not been completed.

<HEAD>Creditors Seek To Force Lone Star Steel Subsidiary Into Bankruptcy</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Creditors of <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Facilities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, whose pipemaking operation has been undercut by the energy-industry depression, on Tuesday asked a judge to put the company in bankruptcy proceedings after it failed make a $ 43.8 million payment on its debt. Lone <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION>' parent company, said the petition was filed in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> by eight banks that hold about $ 124.38 million in unsecured debt they previously declared to be in default. The involuntary petition was filed under Chapter 11 of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Code. It does not include Lone Star's other subsidiaries. East <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, which was known as <ORGANIZATION> Lone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> until January, has 20 days to answer the petition. One such response could be its own voluntary petition for protection from creditors while it devises a reorganization plan. Lone <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> has been trying to scale back and restructure its oilfield pipemaking operation for years as the demand for drilling equipment fell. That restructuring included numerous layoffs. No longer is Lone Star the largest private employer in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, a distinction it held for four decades. Most of the company's steel operations are located in the town of Lone Star, built by the company to take advantage of the ore-rich soil about 140 miles east of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. The company also ventured into <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' troubled thrift industry, establishing <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> last year to purchase failed S & amp; Ls under the so-called Southwest Plan. Earnings from the bank last year helped reduce Lone Star's losses by $ 6.7 million, but it was n't enough to overcome a $ 26.4 million loss at <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Overall, <ORGANIZATION> Lone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> posted a $ 40.2 million loss, its fifth deficit in the last six years. Also last year, Lone Star's debt increased threefold to $ 360.4 million, much of it to buy slab steel used to manufacture pipe. But uncertainty over oil prices caused a virtual cessation of pipe purchases last year, and inventories have built up, the company has said. The company was unable to pay interest on its debt in March and missed a $ 43.8 million principal payment due March 31, opening the door for the creditors, led by <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, to try to force the unit into bankruptcy court.

<HEAD>Dollar Lower, Share Prices Inch Down</HEAD>

closing dollar figures and to UPDATE with morning Nikkei, comments.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar was lower against the Japanese yen at late morning Wednesday, while share prices on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> inched down. The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, which shed 241.97 points the previous day, lost another 29.68 points, or 0.09 percent, ending the morning session at 33,183.87. Although the index rose earlier in morning trading, it reversed the trend and fell. The dollar was changing hands at 148.15 yen at late morning, after opening at 148.20 yen, down 0.50 yen from Tuesday's 148.70-yen finish. The currency moved in the narrow range of 148.05 to 148.30 yen. Traders said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency started lower in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> following a large-scale dollar-selling intervention overnight in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Federal Reserve. A Bank of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> trader said dealing in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> was quiet Wednesday, with the majority of investors avoiding major moves, waiting for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade report for April scheduled to be released Thursday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` Some sources were saying the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> also intervened in the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> market this morning, but it has n't been confirmed,'' he said anonymously. Meanwhile, Japanese Finance Minister <PERSON> Tatsuo </PERSON> <PERSON> Murayama </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> that the dollar's recent surge against the Japanese yen has come to a halt. On the stock exchange, a dealer at <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> attributed the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION>'s fall to `` the market's lack of energy.'' `` The exchange rate seems to be stabilizing, but the majority of institutional investors were still in a wait-and-see mood,'' he said, speaking on condition of anonymity. He said participants sold issues sensitive to fluctuation of interest rates, such as steel firms, due to uncertainties over the dollar-yen rate. `` The market's cautiousness was also due to everyone's waiting for the report of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade figures,'' he added.
