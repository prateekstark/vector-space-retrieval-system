 Syndicated columnist <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> will face weapons possession charges after shooting a teen-ager who had taken an unauthorized predawn dip in <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON>'s backyard swimming pool, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday night. The <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said in its Friday editions that <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> was charged with possession of an unregistered handgun and unregistered ammunition in District of <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Layton </PERSON>, director of communications for the <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> government, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that officials refused to comment on the the case until Friday, when a statement will be issued. <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON>, 62, was cleared of assault charges in the case on June 23 after an investigation by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON> said at the time that he believed <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> should be prosecuted for possessing an unregistered handgun. But <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON> deferred that decision to the city, which normally decides whether to prosecute such cases. <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON>, who has frequently written columns calling for strict restrictions on handgun use, was out of town and unavailable for comment. His wife, <PERSON> Vivian </PERSON>, said the couple had no knowledge of the charges against <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said it had been told by <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> office of corporation counsel, which under local law has the authority to prosecute cases involving unregistered firearms, that <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> was charged on Wednesday. The shooting renewed debate on handgun restrictions, as pro-gun groups accused <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> of hypocrisy for owning a gun after publicly opposing the practice. <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> said he obtained the weapon after receiving death threats. If convicted on the charges, the columnist faces a maximum penalty of two years in jail and a $ 2,000 fine in connection with the June 14 incident at his northwest <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> home. The District of <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'s 1976 handgun ordinance requires that all weapons be registered, but <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> told authorities that the gun had belonged to his son, <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent. <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> claimed that his son was told he did not have to register the weapon after leaving the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> told authorities that he shot <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 18, of <LOCATION> Chevy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chase </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, after hearing noises in his back yard, calling police and discovering <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> and three other youths by his pool. <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> said he shot <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> after the teen-ager lunged at him. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> disputed that, saying he did not threaten the columnist and was shot while trying to flee. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, who was wounded in the wrist, was treated and released the same day from <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. He and and a companion were each charged with one count of unlawful entry stemming from their foray onto <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON>'s property, but prosecutors dropped the misdemeanor charges in exchange for 40 hours of community service work from both.

 A man robbed a tourist at gunpoint on crowded Fifth Avenue outside <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Patrick </LOCATION>'s Cathedral, then was shot and killed Wednesday when he tried to escape in a car driven by an off-duty correction officer, police said. During a struggle inside the car, the correction officer fired his gun, striking the robbery suspect three times in the chest, said a police spokesman, Sgt. <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>. The suspect, <PERSON> Angel </PERSON> <PERSON> Santiago </PERSON>, 22, of Queens died later in the afternoon at <LOCATION> Bellevue </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said. The correction officer, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonilla </PERSON>, 33, also shot himself in the foot during the struggle and was in stable condition at <LOCATION> Bellevue </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> fired no shots, but police recovered a revolver, believed to be <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>'s, that contained five live rounds, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bonilla </PERSON>'s 5-year-old son, also named <PERSON> John </PERSON>, was in the car at the time of the 5 p.m. shooting but was not injured, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said. A second robbery suspect was still at large, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashcraft </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Muncie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, said he was visiting midtown <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> with his family, standing on the sidewalk photographing the historic Roman Catholic cathedral, when two men pulled up in a car and one got out and demanded his video camera. `` He said if you do n't give me your camera and take it over and put it in that car right now I'm going to shoot you. At that point I did n't believe he had a gun,'' said <PERSON> Ashcraft </PERSON>. `` But then he pulled the gun and when he pulled the gun I gave him the camera,'' <PERSON> Ashcraft </PERSON> said. As the robbers tried to speed off, their car collided with a taxi and then slammed into the side of a bus. The pair then jumped out of their car and fled on foot before <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> got into <PERSON> Bonilla </PERSON>'s car, police said. The gun used by <PERSON> Bonilla </PERSON> was his personal revolver, which he was authorized to carry, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ashcraft </PERSON> recovered his video camera from the robbery suspects' car, where they had left it behind when they fled, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said `` We've been riding the subways every place we go and not had a fear in the world,'' said <PERSON> Ashcraft </PERSON>, who was with his wife, their 6-year-old daughter and 9-year-old son and Mrs. <PERSON> Ashcraft </PERSON>'s uncle. Now, he said, `` I'm a little afraid.'' But he said he would n't consider <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> `` a bad place. It's just one incident.''

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> stepped up his search for a vice presidential running mate Wednesday, inviting former rival <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> and other prominent Republicans o submit detailed background information. Democratic candidate <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> burnished his law-and-order credentials. Several other Republicans who figure prominently in vice presidential speculation have not yet received questionnaires from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, according to their spokesmen. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who has about three weeks left to pick a running mate for the fall campaign, also disclosed plans to testify before the Republican platform committee when it meets the week before the party's convention in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> early next month. Republican sources said a request for background information had gone out to Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> as well as to <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>. And <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> said he had received a questionnaire from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign officials. An aide for <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said the congressman met with <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kimmitt </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> attorney who is helping the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign filter possible running mates. The aide, <PERSON> Marci </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, said the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> congressman would return the material to the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign within a week. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' running mate, Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, lambasted the Republican for opposing the Equal Rights Amendment and other women's concerns. `` The Reagan-Bush administration opposes the ERA ... they ripped it out of the -LRB- Republican -RRB- platform,'' he told the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> and Professional Women meeting in <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>, N.M. He said that despite <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s call last week for tax credits for day care, the administration fought ` ` every step of the way'' against a $ 50 million spending proposal with the same goal <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, boosted by his own party's convention, drew his biggest lead of the presidential campaign _ 18 points over <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> _ in the latest <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> poll. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spent his day in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, ostensibly tending to <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> statehouse duties but staging a bill-signing ceremony for legislation to add about 1,000 beds to state prisons and to restore child pornography legislation that was struck down by the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. He also announced distribution of $ 7.8 million in state and federal grants to assist the victims of crime, and said his state is a national leader in `` increasing sensitivity and awareness of what it is like to be a victim of crime.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also cited a 13 percent drop in crime in his state in the past four years. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' public events during the day seemed designed to counter the Republican charge that he is soft on crime, particularly in view of his one-time support for a prison furlough program that permitted some first-degree murderers to receive passes. One such prisoner raped a <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> woman while on furlough. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also signed a $ 124 million spending plan to close the books on the fiscal year that ended June 30. The money was largely for underfunded entitlement programs such as Medicaid and Aid to Families with Dependent Children. Aides to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, meanwhile, have said he is conducting polling in several key states to gauge the impact of several potential running mates. In addition to <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, the names mentioned most frequently in the speculation include <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republican Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON>. Several women's names also crop up periodically, including Sen. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kassebaum </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>, a former secretary of Transportation. Aides to Sen. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON>, former <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Lamar </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>, Rep. <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and Sens. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> all said they had not received questionnaires. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign officials declined to say how seriously candidates such as <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> and <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON> were being taken, although there was speculation that at least some names were being made public to mask the true deliberations as well as to give the officials involved additional stature in their states. One man not mentioned in the speculation, Sen. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, held a news conference in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to announce an effort designed to pressure <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> into picking a conservative running mate. <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> said the Coalition for a Winning Ticket would not be a `` stalking horse for any one candidate'' but a `` rallying point for conservatives who hope to persuade the vice president to choose someone from the conservative majority wing of the party.'' As for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, campaign spokeswoman <PERSON> Alixe </PERSON> <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> said the vice president would travel to the convention city of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> on Aug. 8 to address the platform committee and `` put his stamp of approval on the platform.'' The vice president is n't expected to return until Aug. 17, the day he is formally nominated as the party's candidate for president. In other developments, the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> disclosed it is conducting a multi-million dollar advertising campaign leading up to the convention. The three, 30-second commercials do not mention <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> by name, but tout `` seven years of jobs, peace and economic growth brought to you by the Republicans.'' One commercial evokes images of the high inflation and long gas lines of <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s presidency as the announcer says, `` The Republicans have worked very hard to make sure you'll never have to see it again.'' In the latest poll _ a telephone survey of 1,770 registered voters conducted Saturday through Monday _ <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> received 50 percent support to 32 percent for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had led by 10 points, 46-36, in a pre-convention NBC-Journal poll. Other recent surveys have found a jump in <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' support, common for presidential nominees following their party conventions. Two Gallup polls done after the convention had <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> ahead by 17 points, and he led by 10 points in one poll and by 12 in another conducted during the convention. The latest poll found women providing a major component of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' support, a continuation of the `` gender gap'' suffered by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> led by 30 points among women, 54-24, compared to a six-point lead among men. The survey had a margin of error of three points. Among the Democrats, an aide to <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said the runner-up to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in the primary campaign is `` fired up'' and ready to begin active campaigning for the party's ticket. A spokesman at the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> would continue to receive security protection while a decision is made on whether to grant protection for the entire fall campaign. In <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> met briefly Wednesday with <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> to discuss <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s role in the campaign, but neither side would give details. `` It's part of a series of meetings to ensure ongoing communication with all parts of the party and to make certain everyone gets involved,'' committee spokeswoman <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Anbender </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Also Wednesday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told a group of young inventors `` this election is really about you,'' saying they and other young people hold the key to the 21st century. `` Education is the engine that drives our inventive spirit,'' the vice president said, reiterating his frequently sounded theme that he wants to be the `` education president.''

<TEXT>
 Cardinal <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, breaking with fellow peace pilgrim Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, said Wednesday that <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> should remove its `` occupying forces'' from <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> `` within a reasonable time.'' `` I can not imagine there will be lasting peace ... until all British troops have withdrawn,'' he told reporters as he left <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> after a six-day peace pilgrimage. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> had said at the start of the pilgrimage that he'd come to pray, not to talk politics. But the cardinal broke his silence after <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, his pilgrimage companion, reversed himself and endorsed the British presence in <LOCATION> Ulster </LOCATION>. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, who returned Wednesday afternoon to <LOCATION> John </LOCATION> <LOCATION> F. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, called on <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> officials to announce `` a phased withdrawal'' _ one the cardinal said was supported by most people in the province. Asked if it should begin immediately, <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> replied, `` That's not for me to say. Before leaving <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> on Tuesday, <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said a day in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> had convinced him the British do not deserve `` the castigation that many of us, myself included, have heaped upon them. The British army is not an ` occupation force,' -LRB- but rather -RRB- a guardian of peace.'' The British army has patrolled <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> since the early 1970s, when a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> civil rights movement came under attack by <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> police and paramilitary groups. But the Protestant violence also revitalized the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>; since then, the primary opponents have been the British and the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>, which wants to unite the island. In recent years many British troops have been withdrawn, and their duties assumed by members of Ulster's army reserve. About two-thirds of <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s population is Protestant, and surveys indicate that a majority of the province's residents _ including many Catholics _ favor union with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said his own 24 hours in Ulster convinced him there is `` an environment of increasing understanding'' between Catholics and Protestants, and that `` an overwhelming number'' of both want the troops out. Although <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said he based his conclusion on talks with Protestants, he did not meet with militants in either community during his visit. The mayor's comments drew a heated response from Irish-American politicians, including <LOCATION> Nassau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Comptroller <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, who called the remarks `` senseless and ridiculous.'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> was more circumspect. He said he was not angry with <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, and felt that because <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> did not grow up as an Irish-American, he failed to realize the British have been calling themselves peacemakers in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> for centuries.

 Rude treatment by a clerk at a Radio Shack store prompted a customer to call the store and complain. But it turned out that the man who waited on her was a robber, police say. Three men walked into the suburban Colerain store Tuesday, pulled a revolver on a clerk, then took him to a back room and tied him up, police said. Before the three could take anything, the woman, whom police would not identify, walked in. One of the gunmen, who was wearing a white dress shirt, went behind a counter to wait on her. She purchased her merchandise and left, and the three then escaped. Police arrived after the clerk freed himself, and an officer answered the woman's call of complaint about `` the demeanor and conduct'' of the service, police said. Officers told her she had been waited on by a burglar and asked her to return to the store to help identify the robbers. No arrests were made.

<TEXT>
 Four highway billboards that urge motorists not to give to street beggars have drawn some uncharitable comments from the city's <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, which worries the advertisements may hurt El Paso's image. `` I'm concerned -LRB- they -RRB- may not do good service to the fact that this city is a truly giving city,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dugan </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paso </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>. `` It does n't portray us as the kind of city I know us to be.'' An anonymous group paid for four billboards along Interstate 10 that read: `` Please do n't give to beggars _ they cause traffic problems.'' The signs are the latest development in a controversy about street beggars who cross the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Ciudad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juarez </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, and panhandle on interstate access roads east of downtown. City Councilman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Candelaria </PERSON>, who participated in several council discussions about the scores of beggars congregating at access road intersections, said people who give encourage panhandlers to return. He said givers can contribute in other ways. `` We feel sorry for the people, but they endanger their lives by crossing near I-10,'' <PERSON> Candelaria </PERSON> said. `` Give your charitable dollars to Project Hungry before you give to these beggars.'' Some witnesses told the council earlier this month that panhandlers often are employed by Juarez-based professional begging rings, and that they often are not as needy as they seem. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Huff </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Bauman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which owns the billboards, said the group that paid for the ads wishes to remain anonymous. The ads cost about $ 1,200 and will be visible for about two weeks, he said.

<TEXT>
 Bavarian state officials are warning people leaving on vacation to avoid sex and French kissing with strangers as a precaution against AIDS. The recommendations, carried in a travelers' brochure issued Wednesday, unleashed an angry debate over how the deadly disease is transmitted. AIDS-Help, a West German group that gives AIDS advice, accused state officials of trying to `` legitimize pseudo-medicine.'' The group said the salivary gland can not transmit AIDS. However, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, an AIDS adviser to the Bavarian government, said tests indicate it might be possible for the deadly virus to be transmitted through mucous membranes. AIDS, which attacks the body's immune system, is spread mainly by sexual contact, the use of contaminated needles among drug abusers and transfusion of tainted blood.

 A child actress who starred in last summer's `` Jaws IV: The Revenge'' was killed with her mother Wednesday in an apparent murder-suicide initiated by her father, who also died, authorities said The coroner had not yet identified the couple and the child, but neighbors said the girl was <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Barsi </PERSON>, 11, who starred in the third sequel to the series about a man-eating shark. Miss <PERSON> Barsi </PERSON> also appeared in the partly fact-based television movie `` Fatal Vision,'' playing a daughter of Dr. <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>, who was convicted of killing his pregnant wife and both his daughters at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bragg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, in 1970. Miss <PERSON> Barsi </PERSON>'s father apparently shot the girl and the mother in their heads, set the inside of the house on fire, then turned the gun on himself, police said. The fire caused extensive damage to the interior of the home. A researcher at <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION> confirmed Miss <PERSON> Barsi </PERSON> starred in `` Jaws IV: The Revenge'' as a character called `` Thea.'' She also performed in several commercials and had appeared in the television show `` Growing Pains,'' neighbors said. `` She was adorable ... quite precocious, blonde and blue-eyed,'' said former neighbor <PERSON> Adrienne </PERSON> <PERSON> Conway </PERSON>. She said the mother and father had been having marital problems. Neighbors said they heard an explosion at 8:30 a.m., then saw flames shooting out of a front window of the tan, single-story house on a quiet street. One neighbor tried to douse the flames with water from a garden hose until firefighters arrived. Officers at the scene said the father, identified by neighbors as <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Barsi </PERSON>, apparently doused the interior of the couple's home with gasoline and set it ablaze before shooting himself in the head. The mother, <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Barsi </PERSON>, estimated to be about 40, was found in the hallway and the body of Miss <PERSON> Barsi </PERSON> in a bedroom, officials said. Both had been burned, said Fire Battalion Chief <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Police Lt. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Knowles </PERSON> said the man was found still holding the gun. Neighbors said the girl had an extremely protective father. `` The child was not allowed to go anywhere, very few places alone,'' said neighbor <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>. `` Even when she came to our home, it always had to be OK'd by <PERSON> Dad </PERSON> before she came up the street because apparently he was afraid she would run away.''

 A teacher contract that significantly boosts salaries in the nation's fourth-largest school system and pays $ 64,000 to some veteran educators won unanimous approval Wednesday from the <ORGANIZATION> Dade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. The three-year contract increases average teacher pay for the upcoming academic year 28 percent to $ 33,066, more than $ 5,000 above the national median. `` The excuse that teachers could not do their jobs because of low pay is no longer an excuse in this school system,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Krop </PERSON>, chairman of the seven-member school board. `` Many school systems have talked about programs like this, but we did something about it.'' <PERSON> Krop </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dade </PERSON> has already received more applicants because of publicity about the pay proposal. <ORGANIZATION> Dade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> Superintendent <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> said he hoped the pay increase will raise the status of teaching in the minds of students making career choices. `` We want young people making their professional decisions to not look at teaching as a dead-end profession,'' <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> told the school board. <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s system, with about 255,000 students and more than 15,200 teachers, is the nation's fourth-largest behind <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Under the contract, a first-year teacher would receive $ 23,000 annually and $ 64,000 a year would be paid to an educator with 14 years experience, a doctorate and who teaches summer school. The average salaries would increase to $ 36,042 the second year and $ 39,646 the third year, said <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> schools spokesman <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Gollan </PERSON>.

 The state <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s highest court, agreed Wednesday to hear <PERSON> Bernhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON>'s appeal of his conviction on charges that he illegally possessed the gun he used to shoot four young men on a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> subway in 1985 Without comment, Judge <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Bellacosa </PERSON> granted the appeal and scheduled arguments for Oct. 17, said <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mordaunt </PERSON>. <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON>'s original sentence on the gun possession charges had been ruled illegal by a <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> appeals court and his resentencing is set for Oct. 22 in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON>'s lawyers claim that state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Crane </PERSON>, the trial judge, erred in his instructions to the jury and that the gun conviction should be overturned. <PERSON> Crane </PERSON> had originally sentenced <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> to six months in jail, a $ 5,000 fine, 280 hours of community service, five years probation and psychiatric counseling. The <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> appeals court allowed all but the jail term to stand. The appeals court ruled that <PERSON> Crane </PERSON> should give <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> an undeterminate sentence or, if sentencing was going to be under <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s gun control laws, a definite one-year term without probation. <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON>, 40, was convicted last summer of third-degree illegal possession of a gun in connection with the December 1984 shooting aboard a subway of four teen-agers he said were trying to rob him. The young men claimed they were panhandling for money. <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> was acquitted of all but the gun charge.

 Scores of small quakes have rattled an Aleut fishing village during the past 17 days, and geologists say they are keeping a wary eye on the possible source: a volcano that's been dormant for centuries. King Cove village is only nine miles from <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dutton </ORGANIZATION>'s 4,834-foot peak About 1,000 people live in the village during the summer; 700 stay through winter. Aside from the earthquakes that have been jolting the community 625 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>, there have been no other signs of an imminent eruption, said <PERSON> Betsy </PERSON> <PERSON> Yount </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Geological Survey geologist here. `` There's no melting back of snow around the summit. No steam-type vents,'' sher said Wednesday. `` We're still assessing the seismic activity to determine whether it's related to volcanic activity or not.'' Geologists are unsure when <PERSON> Mount </PERSON> <PERSON> Dutton </PERSON> last erupted. `` There's no historical records of its erupting. That means in the past 200 or so years,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Davies </PERSON>, state seismologist and coordinating scientist for the newly formed <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Volcano </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observatory </ORGANIZATION>. `` It may have erupted 500 years ago, but we have no date. Clearly, it's erupted in the last 10,000 years or so.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Taber </PERSON>, a geologist with <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Lamont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Doherty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observatory </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Palisades </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, said seismographs first picked up earthquake activity near <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dutton </LOCATION> on July 11. Some of the 18 instruments installed by the institute to monitor Aleutian Arc volcanic activity indicated the first temblors were centered 10 to 15 miles southeast of the peak, he said. `` In the last three or four days its been dying off,'' <PERSON> Taber </PERSON> said from the institute's Sand Point office. `` There's no cause for concern at this point at all. There was a sequence of -LRB- earthquakes -RRB- in 1984. They were smaller, but they went on for about four months. It's not even unusual to have them there.'' Scores of quakes ranging from 1.0 to 3.6 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale have struck in this round. The peak activity occurred Friday, when 127 were recorded, <PERSON> Taber </PERSON> said. On Monday, there were 25, he said. The epicenters moved slowly toward the <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dutton </LOCATION>, and in the last few days, the centers have been underneath the volcano's south flank, <PERSON> Taber </PERSON> said. The temblors have jolted the nearby village regularly. `` We've felt four or five in a day, that's probably the most But there's no other sign of activity at all,'' said <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Samuelson </PERSON>, city clerk the village on the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> `` People are concerned, but no one's leaving.'' <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> officials had been scheduled to travel to King Cove in September, but went this week because of the earthquakes, said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Sey </PERSON>, the agency's chief of operations and planning. `` The main purpose was just to answer questions, make people aware and bring them up to date on what's happening and explain different things they could do if there were an eruption,'' Sey said. A telephone line is being installed so that the <ORGANIZATION> Geophysical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alaska-Fairbanks </ORGANIZATION> can monitor <PERSON> Taber </PERSON>'s seismographs, plus one <PERSON> Davies </PERSON> recently installed on the mountain's <PERSON> Taber </PERSON> has been in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> servicing his observatory's seismographs and plans to leave this week, <PERSON> Davies </PERSON> said The link will allow scientists in Fairbanks to check the volcano's pulse virtually around the clock, he said. `` We're going to monitor it as closely as we can,'' he said.

 <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s prime minister was quoted Thursday as saying <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla delegates tried to obstruct agreements at talks on ending <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s civil war. The <ORGANIZATION> Jakarta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> quoted Prime Minister <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> of the Vietnamese-installed government as saying he would hold a third round of separate peace talks with resistance leader Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> in October. <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>'s forces are allied with the communist <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Son </PERSON> <PERSON> Sann </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> in a coalition fighting Vietnamese troops that invaded <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in late 1978. <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON>, the guerrilla groups, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> and the six-member <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday began their fourth day of informal peace talks in <LOCATION> Bogor </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Jakarta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported that <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> said <PERSON> Khieu </PERSON> <PERSON> Samphan </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> representative, `` was not forthcoming to the point of acting obstructive when it came to nailing down some specific points of agreement.'' On Wednesday, <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> urged all factions to agree on a plan for ending the `` miseries and humiliations'' that have afflicted <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> since the <LOCATION> Indochina </LOCATION> war ended in 1975. The enduringly popular leader, who ruled <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> until 1970, made the remarks in <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION>, where he has tried to influence developments in a meeting of the four factions at <LOCATION> Bogor </LOCATION>, about 40 miles south of the capital. All factions agree that <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, 65, should have a central role in the future leadership. `` I ask you not to leave <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> without having signed together a joint communique which shall tell our people and the world that the four Cambodian factions are at least capable to understand each other on certain essential points ... leading us towards the end of a long and dark tunnel,'' <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> said. Evoking the glories of Cambodian history, he said: `` Allow me to recall that you all pretend to be the dignified descendants of the very glorious builders of the world famous monuments of Angkor. `` If, like dignified descendants of the builders of Angkor, our four factions wish to rapidly get rid of the last Vietnamese units from our soil, they will only succeed to do so by achieving national reconciliation and unity.'' Angkor, in northwestern <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, was the capital of the Khmer Empire from the 9th century to the 15th. Its most imposing monuments are Angkor Wat, a temple complex built in the 12th century by King Suryavariman II, and <PERSON> Angkor </PERSON> <PERSON> Thom </PERSON>, built about 1200 by <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jayavarman </PERSON> VII. <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> said, speaking in English, that it is handy to blame <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> for all <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s troubles, `` but it is not less true that some Khmer -LRB- <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> -RRB- factions are equally heavily responsible for these miseries and humilations.'' <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> invaded <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in December 1978 and ousted the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> regime of <PERSON> Pol </PERSON> <PERSON> Pot </PERSON>, which gained control at the end of the war and had killed hundreds of thousands of Cambodians. More than 100,000 Vietnamese soldiers remain in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, fighting the resistance coalition <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> formerly led. <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> has said it will withdraw all its troops by early 1990. The prince called for an interim government of the four factions under `` a collegial system perfectly equal,'' and proposed that fighting units be kept intact under a general staff representing all factions. Each government department would have four co-ministers. An international conference convened under the auspices of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> secretary-general would supervise withdrawal of foreign forces, guarantee the nation's neutrality and help organize free elections. <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> resigned earlier this month as head of the resistance coalition and is in <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION> as a guest of President <PERSON> Suharto </PERSON>, which allows him to participate in the peace talks indirectly. <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> presented his own peace plan at <LOCATION> Bogor </LOCATION> on Monday, and <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> said his proposals include some of its points. `` I think my proposal is the most realistic,'' he said. `` The very solution is in my proposals, not those of the charming <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON>. I have to reject all other proposals in favor of mine.'' He and <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> negotiated in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> last December and January without finding a formula for peace. Son <PERSON> Sann </PERSON> said he supported <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>'s plan but the other participants were not available for comment. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Co </PERSON> <PERSON> Thach </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> told a news conference Wednesday that working groups would be formed to prepare for further negotiations. No conclusive agreement had been expected from the <LOCATION> Bogor </LOCATION> conference, which was considered a success for merely taking place.

 A 24-year-old carpenter was charged in federal court Wednesday in connection with a series of pipe bombs planted last week on streets, in a mailbox and in a newspaper vending machine in two suburban towns. <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tefft </PERSON>, who said he had homes in both <LOCATION> Framingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Belmont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, was charged in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> with unlawful possession of an unregistered destructive device, interstate transportation of 10 destructive devices and malicious damage to property by means of an explosion. Each charge carries a maximum penalty of up to 10 years in jail and a $ 250,000 fine. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomson </PERSON>, assistant agent in charge of the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> office of the federal <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firearms </ORGANIZATION>, said an investigation is continuing and there may be other arrests in the case. Three of the homemade pipe bombs exploded in <LOCATION> Needham </LOCATION> last week, one each outside the police and fire department and one in a newspaper vending machine about 15 seconds after a jogger ran by. All mailboxes in the town were sealed after a fourth bomb was found unexploded in a box outside the post office. Two undetonated devices were found later in neighboring Wellesely. Authorities said <PERSON> Tefft </PERSON> gave no reason for exploding the devices. They declined to say whether he was involved in all the incidents, but they said he traveled between <LOCATION> Needham </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> to make and plant some of the devices. <PERSON> Tefft </PERSON> was arrested late Tuesday by <ORGANIZATION> ATF </ORGANIZATION> agents assisted by state and local police as he drove into a friend's driveway in <LOCATION> Needham </LOCATION>, authorities said. The bombs were made of galvanized pipes about 6 inches long, filled with gunpowder, threaded and capped on both ends, with fuse holes in the middle, authorities said. Trooper <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Cherven </PERSON>, who is assigned to the state fire marshal's office, said `` any spark, heat source or static'' electricity could cause the bombs to explode. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Sainato </PERSON>, senior explosives technician with the state police, said the bomb found in the mailbox was `` as powerful as a military grenade ... -LRB- and -RRB- could send 10 pieces of shrapnel flying off at 6,000 feet a second.''

 Back in 1936, Republican <PERSON> Alf </PERSON> <PERSON> Landon </PERSON> campaigned against <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> and his New Deal by telling voters, `` I believe that a man can be a liberal without being a spendthrift.'' How times have changed. The Republicans would n't dare call themselves liberals in this presidential campaign, and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> says the Democrats wo n't either. `` You'll never hear that ` L' word - liberal - from them,'' the president said in his radio address last weekend. Some liberals and academics agree with the president, although they say the issues underlying the question of liberalism will still be part of the campaign just as they have been since New Deal days. <PERSON> Landon </PERSON>'s claim to being a liberal did n't do him much good. <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> was re-elected in the biggest electoral landslide in the history of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presidential elections. After that the political landscape shifted, and by 1964, presidential nominee <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON> was telling fellow Republicans, `` Extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice and moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue.'' <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON> fared little better than <PERSON> Landon </PERSON>, as voters gave a green light to <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s `` Great Society.'' Not all of <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s programs turned out as their backers hoped, however. And, as resistance to the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> war deepened, liberalism took on a new face _ one which drew the scorn of the then-governor of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, among others. `` The word ` liberal' came to be associated with costly government activities which did n't eradicate the problems for which they were intended,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON>, professor of political science and public affairs at The <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` Secondly, the word ` liberal' got a bad connotation because of the protests over the war in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. I think the word liberal started getting a real bad rap during the period from 1968 to 1972, culminating in the <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON> candidacy.'' <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pearl </PERSON>, director of the liberal organization Americans for Democratic Action, conceded, `` There is a recognition on the part of many liberals, of many Democrats, that to admit to being a liberal somehow is a detriment, is a negative.'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Moe </PERSON>, a former aide to 1984 Democratic nominee <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>, said he does n't think it makes much difference what the Republicans or the Democrats call each other. `` All of these labels take on different meanings in different contexts at different times,'' said <PERSON> Moe </PERSON>. `` There is an ebb and flow to American history. I do n't attach much significance to labels or what people say about labels. I think the election is going to be fought out on a different ground.'' Democratic presidential candidate <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> suggested one ground when he said in his acceptance speech that `` this election is not about ideology; it's about competence.'' `` If that becomes the case, it would be the first one in modern political history that was able to achieve that,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> ADA </ORGANIZATION>'s Pearl Instead, suggested <PERSON> Pearl </PERSON>, `` they are all going to be fighting for the center, as it were, because that's where the decisions are going to be made.'' <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> put it this way: `` I think the new Democratic position is to be conservative on economic issues, and liberal on social issues.'' Sounds a lot like <PERSON> Alf </PERSON> <PERSON> Landon </PERSON>, does n't it?

 Playboy empire founder <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Hefner </PERSON> said he chose to give up life as a pajama-clad swinging single and marry model <PERSON> Kimberley </PERSON> <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> because `` it will make the relationship better.'' <PERSON> Hefner </PERSON> proposed to Ms. <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> <PERSON> Playboy </PERSON> magazine's Miss January 1988, on Saturday over the wishing well at the <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mansion </ORGANIZATION>, where many other women have shared his life but never completely captured his heart. `` I always had the feeling before that there was something else, some further personal adventure waiting over the hill,'' he said in a telephone interview Wednesday. But in this case, he said: `` It is inconceivable that there could be something else that could be comparable or better.'' <PERSON> Hefner </PERSON>, 62, described his fiancee as `` a homebody,'' who despite the age difference holds similar interests in things like animals and spending evenings talking and watching old movies. Ms. <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON>, who turns 26 next week, said she thought about <PERSON> Hefner </PERSON>'s proposal for a minute, then said `` ` Yes' because I ca n't imagine life without him. She plans to give up modeling. `` I'd rather be at home with <PERSON> Hef </PERSON>. He's my priority,'' she said. Ms. <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON>'s family apparently is supporting the marriage, planned for sometime next year at the mansion. `` I wish them all the luck in the world,'' her grandmother <PERSON> Lila </PERSON> <PERSON> Aldridge </PERSON> said Wednesday from her home in <LOCATION> Moulton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, where her granddaughter was born. <PERSON> Hefner </PERSON> said he has never proposed marriage to anyone `` nor ever really considered marriage'' since his 1958 divorce from his first wife. `` I am doing it as much for myself as for her,'' he said. `` It is going to make the relationship better, that security, that continuity, that reaffirmation.'' Ms. <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON>, who met <PERSON> Hefner </PERSON> last summer during a photo shooting, moved into the Playboy Mansion with two dogs and cat shortly after <PERSON> Hefner </PERSON>'s longtime flame <PERSON> Carrie </PERSON> <PERSON> Leigh </PERSON> moved out in January. Earlier this year, Ms. <PERSON> Leigh </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION>'s 1983 cover girl, attempted to bring a $ 35 million palimony action against <PERSON> Hefner </PERSON> after their affair soured, but it later was dropped. Ms. <PERSON> Leigh </PERSON> said Wednesday through manager <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Battig </PERSON>: `` I hope that he's finally happy at 62 years of age.''

 A blackout hit the capital and most of coastal <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> Wednesday night, hours before President <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> was to give his state-of-the-union address. Leftist guerrillas may have sabotaged power lines and caused the blackout, said <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Acevedo </PERSON>, spokesman for the state power company Electro-Peru. Shining Path guerrillas and a smaller rebel group, the pro-Cuban <ORGANIZATION> Tupac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amaru </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, have caused dozens of blackouts in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and used the cover of darkness to launch attacks. Radio Programas, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s leading news station, said people heard explosions in several parts of the capital. Police told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> they had no reports of guerrilla violence during the power outage. The blackout at 8:15 p.m. affected <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, cities along the 600 miles of the central Peruvian coastline and the highland city of <LOCATION> Huancayo </LOCATION>, 125 miles east of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Acevedo </PERSON> said. Power was restored to most areas within an hour, but areas south of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> were still without electrticity late Wednesday night, <PERSON> Acevedo </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> planned to speak midday Thursday and is expected to address growing violence by leftist guerrillas. The government says more than 12,000 people have been killed in the violence connected to the 8-year-old insurgency of the <ORGANIZATION> Shining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Path </ORGANIZATION>, a Maoist guerrilla group.

<HEAD>NHTSA: Nearly Half Auto Crash Tests Show Chance of Severe Head

<TEXT>
 Nearly half the 37 cars, vans and light trucks that have been crash tested by the government this year would likely cause severe head injuries or death to their drivers in a 35 mph collision. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday released its final report on 1988 crash tests with results showing drivers of vans and light trucks were at high risk of severe head injuries in a crash. Drivers of compact cars were least likely to have severe head injuries, the agency's figures showed. <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> reported the likelihood of injury as an index called the head-injury criterion. The agency derived the index from monitoring dummies strapped into vehicles that were crashed into a fixed barrier at 35 mph. Seventeen of the 1988 vehicles tested produced a head-injury criterion above 1,000, levels that show a high chance of severe head injury or death. <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> cautioned it tested only one vehicle of each model, and additional tests could produce varying results `` due to slight differences in the way vehicles are manufactured and equipped, or due to slight variations in test conditions.'' Small differences in the test results should not be considered significant, <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> said. The Chevrolet G-20 van showed the greatest likelihood of head injury to the driver, with an index of 3,665. The Mazda 929 4-door car, a large and mid-size model, showed the least likelihood, with an index of 273. Tests of nine subcompact cars found five with an index of more than 1,000. The average for the nine vehicles was 966. Subcompact cars showing the greatest chance of head injury and the criteria reported by <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> were the Dodge Colt 4-door station wagon, 1,354; <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pulsar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> NX </ORGANIZATION> 2-door hatchback, 1,134; <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> 2-door, 1,114; Ford Festiva 2-door, 1,014; and the Toyota Tercel 2-door hatchback, 1,005. Two of the nine compact cars tested produced head-injury criteria exceeding 1,000. The average head-injury criterion for that class of car was 887. Compact cars most likely to cause head injury were the Peugeot 505 GLS 4-door, 1,701, and the <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> Sentra 4-door wagon, 1,047. The tests found three out of nine large and mid-size cars with criteria above 1,000. The average head-injury criterion for larger and mid-size cars was 921. Large and mid-size cars with head-injury criteria exceeding 1,000 were the Renault Medallion 4-door, 1,656, Buick Park Avenue 4-door, 1,467; and the <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yorker </ORGANIZATION>, 1,362. The agency tested 10 vans and small trucks and found seven with head-injury criteria exceeding 1,000. The average index for the vehicles was 1,491. Trucks and vans showing the greatest likelihood of head injury were the Chevrolet G-20 van, 3,665; <PERSON> Isuzu </PERSON> <PERSON> Spacecab </PERSON> pickup, 1,873; <PERSON> Chevrolet </PERSON> <PERSON> Astro </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON>, 1,603; <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> NL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> LEV </ORGANIZATION> pickup, 1,528; <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Montero </ORGANIZATION> 4x4, 1,320; <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vanagon </ORGANIZATION>, 1,320; and the <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> F-150 pickup, 1,074. <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION>'s 35 mph crash-test program is not used in the agency's regulation of the automakers but is intended solely as a guide to consumers, the agency said For regulatory purposes, each manufacturer crash tests its own vehicles at 30 mph before the model-year begins. The results are usually kept secret for competitive reasons. Vehicles that test with head-injury criteria exceeding 1,000 must be redesigned before being placed on the market. Also, <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> conducts random testing at 30 mph to check results certified by the automakers. A 35 mph crash is one-third more severe than a 30 mph crash.

 Democratic vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> is fending off questions about differences with running mate <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and working to point up his differences with <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> standard-bearer <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` You're going to see diversity in both parties,'' he told reporters, pressing him to answer <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s charge that they had more in common than <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. He also brushed aside <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> statements that the Democrats had effectively created a three-man ticket that includes <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` I do n't think there's anything to it,'' he said. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said he still might vote for new aid to the Nicaraguan Contras, despite <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' opposition. As for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> opposing <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s plan to impose an import oil fee, he joked, `` I have n't been able to convince <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> either.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s comments came following a speech in <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION> to a businesswomen's convention, in which he tied <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration policies opposed by feminists. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> supports the Equal Rights Amendment and several other initiatives supported by the women's group. The campaign stop in <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION> was at the start of a four-day cross-country campaign swing, which continues with speeches today in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Reno </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Nev </LOCATION>. The campaign will then travel to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Amarillo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>; and a finale in either <LOCATION> Lousiana </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>. Events will be designed to highlight some of <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s differences with the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> and not with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, such as the senator's work on the trade and plant-closing notification bills, and of energy independence programs <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s speech to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Professional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION> came just three days after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> unveiled a $ 2.2 billion child care plan before the same group. `` It's interestng to me that it's taken eight years -LRB- for the Republicans -RRB- to discover day care,'' said <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. Just last year, he said, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> fought `` every step of the way'' against just $ 50 million proposed for child care for poor women. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> himself has not endorsed a $ 2.5 billion Democratic day care proposal, which won the approval Wednesday of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> told the group that the `` gender gap'' _ the pattern of women supporting Democrats in greater proportions than men _ was a direct result of the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> record on issues including the equal rights amendment, equal pay and the law banning discrimination by institutions receiving federal money. `` The Reagan-Bush administration opposes the ERA ... they ripped it out of the -LRB- Republican -RRB- platform,'' he said. `` They oppose the study that will provide the legal foundation for women who are discriminated against to bring their case to court and win.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto of the bill overriding the <LOCATION> Grove </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> ruling of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, which weakened federal anti-bias rules, showed `` this administration tried to compromise equality. ... But we overrode that veto. And we scored a major victory for equality and opportunity in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` The gender gap ... was n't created by accident,'' he said. At the end of his speech, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was presented with a red purse, the group's symbol of how women make less money for comparable work. `` By the end of the Dukakis-Bentsen administration,'' he promised, `` this purse will be black.'' He received a standing ovation from the 2,000 women in the convention hall, several of whom held up Dukakis-Bentsen campaign signs. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> supports pay equity legislation in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> but not the more ambitious comparable worth legislation. He told reporters after his speech he wanted to go one step at a time. He also said he had not yet endorsed maternal leave legislation and has not had time to study it. The businesswomen's group, founded in 1919, has 125,000 members nationwide, of which 51 percent list themselves as Republicans, 47 percent Democrats and the rest independent, according to executive director <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorian </PERSON>. `` There was a lot of enthusiasm for Sen. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and what he had to say,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Dorian </PERSON>. The group was conducting a straw poll and planned to release the results today.

<HEAD>House Votes to Scrap Federal Subsidy on Alaskan Timbering</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Score one for the environmentalists in their protracted battle with tree-cutters in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s largest national forest. By a lopsided 361-47 vote, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday approved legislation to scrap the 1980 law that groups like the <ORGANIZATION> Wilderness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> say is responsible for overharvesting and big <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> losses in the <ORGANIZATION> Tongass </ORGANIZATION> forest in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. The bill moved over to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, where <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s two members could have more success in blocking it in the final weeks of the 1988 session than its lone representative, Republican <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, had in the House. The legislation would scrap a 1980 law that guarantees the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> at least $ 40 million a year to support commercial timber sales in the Tongass, the continent's last large temperate rain forest. Supporters of the bill say the guarantee _ unique for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> national forests _ has not only led to destruction of ancient trees but also produced red ink as Tongass timber sales posted a deficit of $ 254 million from 1982 through 1987. Young argued unsuccessfully that the the bill repudiates a deal made in 1980 with environmentalists when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> put huge portions of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s vast acreage off-limits to development. He said that in return for allowing 8.5 million of the forest's 17 million acres to be declared wilderness, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> lawmakers won the spending guarantee and another requiring the forest service to make an average of 450 million board feet of Tongass timber available for sale each year `` The leisure lobby now wants to go back on its word,'' said <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, who argued that the guarantees are necessary to preserve some 6,000 timber-related jobs in <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. `` It's a matter of jobs,'' <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said. `` There are people's livelihoods at stake. But backers of the legislation argued that the Tongass region should be looking to tourism and commercial fishing for economic growth. They said overharvesting the <ORGANIZATION> Tongass </ORGANIZATION> hurts both tourism and fisheries. Besides getting rid of the guarantees, the overhaul bill sponsored principally by Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mrazek </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N </LOCATION>. Y, would put another 1.7 million Tongass acres off-limits to timber cutting for five Much of the Tongass timber is sold to two large corporations, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> Pacific-Ketchikan and the Japanese-owned <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lumber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pulp </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which turn it into pulp, chiefly for export to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. The bill would require the forest service to renegotiate the 50-year contracts it entered into with these companies in the 1950s. Rep. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>., the bill's floor manager, said new contracts are needed to encourage competition in <LOCATION> Tongass </LOCATION> timbering, prevent excessive cutting of old-growth stands and ensure that the companies pay more for <ORGANIZATION> Tongass </ORGANIZATION> trees <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said a mature <LOCATION> Sitka </LOCATION> spruce from <ORGANIZATION> Tongass </ORGANIZATION> now sells for $ 1.48, compared to $ 2 for a map of the national forest.

 Former army general <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> was elected president Wednesday, one day after being named party leader, and rioting broke out in a northern city in which one person was reported killed and five wounded. The official <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burma </ORGANIZATION> said a curfew was imposed in <LOCATION> Myede </LOCATION>, 220 miles north of <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>, after hundreds of rioters on Tuesday destroyed buildings and attacked police, who fired their guns to disperse the crowd. Sources in the area said one person was killed and five wounded. It was not immediately known if the violence was related to this week's leadership changes, which included the naming Wednesday of active or retired military officers to all but two of the cabinet's 22 posts Western diplomats had said the rise of <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>, a 64-year-old hardliner known for his ruthless supression of dissidents, could lead to more of the anti-government protests that have broken out three times since October. Travelers returning from <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> said leaflets have appeared in recent days urging continued anti-government agitation. A one-day, emergency session of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> elected <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> president. On Tuesday, he assumed the nation's most powerful position, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Burma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, at a special party congress. The Parliament elected the former deputy prime minister, <PERSON> Tun </PERSON> <PERSON> Tin </PERSON>, as prime minister. Vice President <PERSON> Aye </PERSON> <PERSON> Ko </PERSON> remained in his post. Defense Minister <PERSON> Kyaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Htin </PERSON> moved to the No. 3 government position as head of the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, part of a realignment that saw changes in eight of the 22 major government positions. Only two civilians were included in the new lineup: Attorney General <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> and Education Minister <PERSON> Kyaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Sein </PERSON>. The rest are retired or active duty military officers. The selections appeared to represent a continuation of the hard-line, one-party system instituted 26 years ago by <PERSON> Ne </PERSON> <PERSON> Win </PERSON>, who resigned Saturday as president and party chairman. However, a number of liberal economic reforms were endorsed, and some balance within the top echelons appears to have been reached by the promotions of <PERSON> Kyaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Htin </PERSON> and Tun Tin. Both are regarded as relatively liberal on issues of economic reform and dealing with dissent in the country. <PERSON> Kyaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Htin </PERSON> also moved up to a top party post. <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>, a close associate of Ne Win, commanded forces that brutally put down student riots in March in which dozens of people died. Several other officials were reprimanded or fired, including former Prime Minister <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Kha </PERSON>, for their handling of the March 18 unrest in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>, but <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> escaped officially unscathed by the incident. The government has admitted that 43 people died, 41 of them suffocating in a crowded police van while being taken to prison. Unofficial reports said more than 100 people were killed. <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>, who formerly ranked No. 4 in the party hierarchy, also commanded the <ORGANIZATION> Fourth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifles </ORGANIZATION>, a unit that opened fire on about 2,000 anti-government demonstrators at <ORGANIZATION> Rangoon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> on July, 7, 1962. Unofficial casualties were put at more than 100, and the following day authorities blew up the university's student union building. <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> was also involved in putting down demonstrations in 1974, when students and <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monks, angry at a shoddy government funeral for former <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General U Thant, snatched his coffin and brought it to <ORGANIZATION> Rangoon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Troops firing rifles later stormed the campus. Ne Win cited his age and the recent unrest when he resigned. In his resignation speech, he raised hopes that major changes were in store for <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>. In an unprecedented move, he called for a referendum to decide whether the country wished to continue with one-party rule or opt for a multiparty system. The congress turned down the referendum proposal. Ne Win's resignation followed three periods of student-led rioting. There also is mounting discontent over deteriorating economic conditions that have made <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> one of the world's 10 poorest nations, despite its abundance of natural resources. The congress promised a package of liberal economic reforms, including allowing joint ventures between private foreign and local investors and loosening control on a number of sectors, including agriculture and forestry. There was initial skepticism among diplomats about how far these will go and whether the current leaders can implement them. Several diplomats said that the new lineup lacks the expertise in dealing with anything but a state-controlled system, which has led to plummeting industrial production, food shortages, a foreign debt of about $ 4 million and meager social services. `` That the country has gone from bad to worse -LRB- 26 -RRB- years after the seizure of power is evident to anyone not living in a fool's paradise,'' <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON>, a respected government critic, wrote to Ne Win on May 12 `` The country has plunged to the bottom politically, economically and socially. The moral decay is the most deplorable.'' <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON> resigned from Ne Win's government in 1963. His letter has been widely circulated underground in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>. Ne Win is believed to hold his old comrade-in-arms in some respect but there has been speculation the government would move to silence him.

 <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> <PERSON> Wenbao </PERSON> does n't consider himself religious, but each night he puts a stick of incense outside the door of his house and prays for rain. `` There's no other way. I have to rely on heaven,'' <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> said this week in this village in northern <LOCATION> Hubei </LOCATION> province. <PERSON> Chen </PERSON>, his wife, three children and mother live in the heart of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s drought country, stricken this year with its worst blight in 50 years. Beginning as early as February in some parts of central and eastern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the drought has hit eight out of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s 30 provinces. Officials in <LOCATION> Hubei </LOCATION> say about half of the province's rice crop and 70 percent of its peanut and sesame crops will be affected. In addition, they worry about starvation in some areas like <PERSON> Laohekou </PERSON>. The Chinese news media have cited similar figures for grain and vegetable production in other provinces. Officials said other provinces also faced the possibility of starvation. <PERSON> Laohekou </PERSON> has been hit particularly hard by the drought. The village's reservoir is bone dry for the first time since it opened in 1958. <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> for drinking water contain only mud. Trucks carrying potable water from the nearest town, <LOCATION> Xiangfan </LOCATION>, are few. Draft animals have been dying, some because of the heat, which has hovered around 104 degrees for weeks, others because of thirst. <PERSON> Chen </PERSON>, 33, said he's concerned for his family. This spring he planted about 2 -LCB- acres of land. In a good year, with the rich <LOCATION> Hubei </LOCATION> soil, <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> said he could clear $ 540 profit from his fields, well above the average farmer's annual income of $ 125. But this year, the fields are barren. `` My mungbeans are burned. My cotton should be up to my chest but it only hits my ankle so it will be worthless. My tobacco is dead,'' <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> said, pausing to spit in the dust outside his brick house. `` We'll have no vegetables this year and no money.'' Under <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s recent agricultural reforms, peasants sign a contract with the government, promising to produce a certain amount of grain. That grain is then sold to the state at a fixed price, well below what it would get on the free market. Anything extra can be sold for market value. In addition, all vegetables and cash crops can be sold on the market. But without a harvest of vegetables or cash crops, <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> will have no money. <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> said he and his family will live on the winter wheat he harvested earlier this year. But after fulfilling his contract with the state, only 3,000 pounds remained. Chinese officials say one person needs at least 550 pounds of grain a year to survive, so <PERSON> Chen </PERSON>'s family of six has come up short. <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> has pulled up some cotton and planted sweet potatoes to try and fill the gap. `` That's why I'm asking heaven for rain,'' he said. `` But if there's no rain, then things wo n't be good at all.'' <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> said that if the rains do n't come he'll probably take a job in a nearby rock quarry with other villagers, making $ 1.60 a day. `` It will help to feed my family because no one here wants to beg,'' he said. `` But really I do n't want to leave the land.''

 People victimized by erroneous drug test results frequently face loss of their jobs and few are in a position to defend themselves adequately, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has been told. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Waple </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Fayetteville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, attorney who has handled more than 500 drug test cases in the past six years, said Wednesday that such a person `` loses the presumption of innocence and is instead burdened with a presumption of guilt.'' <PERSON> Waple </PERSON> said that in at least 75 percent of his cases, `` there was a significant legal or scientific irregularity which substantially affected the reliability of the ultimate conclusion that the individual had in fact used a controlled substance.'' He said his clients have faced threats of incarceration, loss of security clearances and hospital credentials as well as loss of employment, rank and position. <PERSON> Waple </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on oversight and investigations that the combination of the `` presumption of guilt'' and complex legal and scientific issues makes it very difficult for a person to defend against the positive test result. `` Very few individuals who test positive for controlled substances will have a proper background either through experience or education to know where to begin to defend themselves,'' he said. `` Drug testing laboratories guard their scientific data, their test results, their mathematical computations and their standard operating procedures very carefully.'' He called for `` complete and total disclosure of all of the data supporting a positive test result.''

<HEAD>Mortgage Subsidies to Rural Poor Prove Cost-Effective, Study Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Low-income rural homeowners who receive federal mortgage subsidies have excellent repayment records and benefit from a more stable family life, a private study of 894 households has found. The study by the non-profit <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> also said the <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s low-income home ownership program is cost-effective and should be expanded. Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, said the study released Wednesday proves the program has succeeded in `` the very toughest, hardscrabble places'' and that the poor are neither lazy nor irresponsible and hopeless. `` After all of the attacks on housing assistance programs, this study shows what really happens with subsidized homeownership programs. ... These programs work,'' said <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, chairman of a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on housing. Subsidies to participants in the program declined over a five-year period as their incomes increased, and the number of children living below the poverty level decreased, the study said. The council tracked 894 sample families nationwide who obtained subsizied mortgages in 1981 and concluded the rural homeownership program `` represents a cost-effective strategy to provide decent shelter to low-income households and to assist them in overcoming the burden of poverty.'' The study, financed with a grant from the <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, also found homeownership had indirect benefits, particularly on children, such as stabilizing family life. In 1986, when most borrowers had five years' experience with the program, the study found most were ahead in their payments. Only 7 percent were as much as three months behind, 5 percent had returned their homes to the <ORGANIZATION> FmHA </ORGANIZATION>, and only 1.3 percent had lost their homes to foreclosure. Poverty-level borrowers were less likely than others to be delinquent and more likely to be ahead in payments, the study showed. At the same time, subsidies to the families declined steadily. `` The decline in the subsidy was in part a reflection of upward economic mobility, and this was most evident among young families with children,'' the study said. The Washington-based council advises low-income and minority groups seeking federal assistance for improving rural housing and studies and makes recommendations for state and local housing policies. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> said the program has been cut from $ 2.9 billion in 1979 to $ 1.1 billion last year. `` If anything, the need has grown,'' he said. He and Sen. <PERSON> Alfonse </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, said they are pressing <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to expand the program.

<TEXT>
 Foreign investment in American companies, real estate and other assets has increased dramatically in recent years and is likely to keep climbing through the year 2000, according to a new study. The private study, released Wednesday by the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, said direct foreign investment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has jumped by more than 215 percent since 1980, while American investment abroad increased by only one-fifth that rate. And the study said the pace of foreign investment is expected to accelerate, with foreign buyouts in 1988 expected to make up as much as 20 percent of all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> acquisitions, up from 5 percent in 1987. However, the report said that in absolute terms, foreign investments still account for only 5 percent to 6 percent of total <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assets.

<HEAD>Conservative Paper At Dartmouth Sues School Over Disciplinary

 <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> says `` bullying tactics'' aimed at a black professor by staffers of a stridently conservative student publication led to suspensions that are now the subject of two lawsuits. The <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION>'s lawsuits accuse the college of reverse discrimination against white students and of violating free speech rights for suspending three of its staffers. The Review staffers were suspended following a confrontation in a college classroom with a black music professor who earlier had been harshly criticized in the independent, off-campus newspaper. Review attorney <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> said `` the facts clearly indicate that the students would not have been given such draconian penalties if they were black students criticizing a white professor.'' But officials at the private liberal arts college in <LOCATION> Hanover </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, said Wednesday the disciplinary action against the students was taken to preserve the `` integrity'' of the classroom. Described by its critics as anti-minority, anti-women and anti-homosexual, the Review often has been the center of controversy since it was founded in 1980. In March of this year, <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Freedman </PERSON> blasted the paper, calling its staff `` ideological provocateurs posing as journalists.'' The faculty censured it in 1982 as racist and sexist after a critique of <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION>'s affirmative action programs, written in what was intended to be black dialect and headlined: `` Dis Sho' Ai n't No Jive, Bro. In 1984, a Review reporter secretly tape-recorded a Gay Students Association meeting and published excerpts and the names of group leaders. A <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION> disciplinary panel ruled in March that the three Review staffers were guilty of disorderly conduct for failing to leave Professor <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>'s classroom after being asked to do so. The paper earlier had described <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>'s music class as `` one of <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION>'s most academically deficient courses.'' The paper's attorneys, who filed suits in federal and state courts in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, announced the action at a <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> news conference Wednesday with support from three conservative lawmakers. Sen. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, called the disciplinary actions `` nothing less than a crude assault on freedom of expression and political diversity on campus.'' `` The elite <ORGANIZATION> Ivy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> academics constantly proclaim themselves the champions of free speech and diversity of opinion. Yet here, when a small band of students express a viewpoint offensive to the prevailing orthodoxy, the college comes squarely down on the side of suppression and harsh persecution.'' <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> was joined at the news conference by Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>, R-Colo., and Rep. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION> A state suit filed in <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> addresses the free speech issue, while a federal suit filed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> focuses on the reverse discrimination charge <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Huppe </PERSON>, who attended the news conference, said the disciplinary action had nothing to do with First Amendment rights. `` The sanctity of a classroom is what this is all about,'' <PERSON> Huppe </PERSON> said. `` <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> has got to protect the integrity of a classroom. They went in there to disrupt his classroom.'' <PERSON> Huppe </PERSON> accused the students of using `` bullying tactics'' in their confrontation with the professor and their refusal to leave. After the classroom incident, <PERSON> Freedman </PERSON>, the college president, said the paper had been `` irresponsible, mean-spirited, cruel and ugly'' and that it was trying to poison the `` intellectual environment'' of the campus.

<HEAD>House Votes To Make Park Service Director Non-Political</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The Democratic-controlled House has given the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration what amounts to a vote of no confidence for its handling of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s network of national parks. The action came Wednesday as the chamber voted 248-130 for Democratic legislation to strip political appointees in the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deparment </ORGANIZATION> of their day-to-day power over the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. The vote capped nearly eight years of friction over a variety of parks and federal land-use issues between the Republican administration and Democrats on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. The bill faces an uncertain future in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in the waning weeks of the 100th <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. And if it reaches President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s desk, it will be vetoed, says Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lagomarsino </PERSON>, R-Calif The proposal, sponsored principally by Rep. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Vento </PERSON>, D-Minn., would make the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> director a presidential appointee who would be confirmed by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> for a five-year term The director now serves at the pleasure of the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> secretary and can be removed at any time for any reason. The bill would require a president to show cause before firing a parks director. The legislation would strip the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> secretary and assistant secretaries of any authority over the park service except for its budget, a matter on which <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has the final word. The measure also would create a three-member park system review board _ appointed by the president and confirmed by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> _ to advise the director and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on how to improve the national parks. <PERSON> Vento </PERSON>, who leveled no criticism against parks director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Penn </PERSON> <PERSON> Mott </PERSON>, said the changes are necessary because professionals in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> have been `` supplanted by political decision-making.'' `` The director of the park service has consistently been ordered -LRB- by superiors -RRB- to give political testimony,'' <PERSON> Vento </PERSON> said. `` The director ought to be free to act, but he is undercut and undermined constantly by political appointees.'' He said that political appointees have forced resignations and transfers of park superintendents they did n't like, changed performance ratings for parks personnel and required park officials to obtain clearance for testimony before congressional committees. `` It's time to put a stop to this,'' said <PERSON> Vento </PERSON>, who chairs the Interior national parks and public lands subcommittee. Subcommittee member <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>., said that `` political expediency overrules professional judgment This occurs because the secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> holds the reins.'' <PERSON> Lehman </PERSON> said that the secretary can not serve as the nation's `` chief park ranger'' when his other duties also make him `` the chief miner, chief oil-driller, chief cattle grazer and chief water developer. <PERSON> Lagomarsino </PERSON> said the plan is unconstitutional, `` completely unworkable'' and a `` dangerous precedent'' because it creates a virtually independent entity within a Cabinet department. Rep. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Craig </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Idaho </LOCATION>, said that `` this legislation is the worst kind of micromanagement. The country does not need a law creating a new bureaucracy.''

 Apartment tenants need not fret for fear their bawling babies will prompt legal action by angry neighbors, a renters' group says. But the group's guidelines do strongly advise against letting youngsters ride up and down apartment house elevators just for the fun of it. The German Tenants' Association, which released its guidelines to tenants on Wednesday, said children's laughter and crying are not legally justified grounds for complaints by other renters. The same goes for noise from `` normal play activities'' inside the children's own apartment, the Cologne-based group said. Behavior outside the apartment is another matter, though. The group advised keeping thrill-seeking children out of elevators and off roller skates and bicycles around stairwells and in basements.

<TEXT>
 For the first time in the Soviet bloc, a 1956 speech in which <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> denounced <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s brutal policies has been made public in a Communist party newspaper The speech <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> delivered three years after the death of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>, his predecessor, marked the formal break with Stalinism in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. It was leaked to Western reporters in 1956. The 400,000-circulation party weekly, Polityka, devoted four full pages to the speech in its July 30 edition, which went on sale to the public Wednesday. The paper also carried a half-page commentary by two of its journalists. `` This is not the first time that it turns out that something that is known to everybody must be said aloud sooner or later,'' the Polish weekly said. The publication comes as the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, under <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s leadership, carries out a campaign to discredit <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> and shed light on dark pages of Soviet history. Polish leader <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> and the Polish party have been strong supporters of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s moves toward `` glasnost,'' or openness. <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON>'s speech, delivered at a closed meeting at the 20th Congress of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> on Feb. 25, 1956, condemned <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s `` cult of personality.'' <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON>, who led the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> from 1958 to 1964, said Soviet founder <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> warned that <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> could be cruel. The speech blamed <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>, who came to power in 1941, for executions and deportations of people after show trials. About 20 million Soviets were killed in political purges carried out under <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> and in the drive to collectivize agriculture, according to estimates by Western historians. <PERSON> Polityka </PERSON> said that since 1956 it kept a copy numbered 2,094 of a Polish reprint of the speech, which had been brought back from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> by Polish guests to the Soviet congress. Leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> Polish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the country's ruling communist party, at the time authorized reprinting the secret speech for internal party use. `` <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> did a great thing. But the leadership of the Polish party has done a great thing also. The Polish text of the report is the only official version until today,'' Polityka said. A spokeswoman for <PERSON> Polityka </PERSON> said Wednesday that no editors authorized to comment on the publication were available. A spokesman for the Censor's Office in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, who identified himself only as Mr. <PERSON> Osiek </PERSON>, said he could only comment generally that, `` Today the range of freedoms to publish various information ... is so broad _ and getting broader day by day.''

 A mayor who told police officers to shoot youngsters to stop them from brawling with sticks in a city park rescinded the order Wednesday, saying he simply wanted to get the attention of the `` hoodlums.'' Mayor B.A. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said he issued the order to `` shoot from the waist down'' because youths from <PERSON> Wadley </PERSON> and nearby towns were turning the 12-acre Hope Williams Memorial Park into a fighting ring. `` I had not intended -LRB- for police -RRB- to shoot them anyway. It was issued temporarily. I did n't think it would take very long for those young people to get the idea we meant business,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. `` It is merely to warn and to threaten and to let them know they are not going to take over the city.'' He said he'd learned `` some of my people are embarrassed'' by the order. `` All and all, it is a thing that will fade away,'' he added. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, who once ordered police to shoot burglars and also ordered them to shoot stray dogs, said as part of the attempt to stop brawls in the park the fine for fighting was going to be increased from $ 71.50 to $ 125.

<HEAD>Agricultural Banks Were Strong Going Into Drought</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A preliminary review by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says that many banks serving farmers were in much better shape going into this summer's devastating drought than they would have been a few years ago. The figures, which are far from conclusive, were compiled by the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> only through June 11. But economists were able to make some general observations based upon the situation leading up to and including the early months of the 1988 drought. `` Because changes in agricultural banking conditions tend to lag changes in the farm economy, banks will not feel the full effects of this year's drought until 1989,'' the agency said. Overall, the agency reports in a forthcoming issue of <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Outlook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION>, agricultural commercial banks _ those with above-average concentrations of farm loans _ were rebounding as farmers entered the spring planting season. `` Farm banks are better poised to deal with losses from agricultural loans than they were a few years ago,'' the report said. `` Their delinquent farm loans have been falling since mid-1986, and the drop in real farmland values has bottomed out in most parts of the country.'' Even so, 20 percent of 543 agricultural banks classified as `` vulnerable'' at the beginning of this year are located in the worst drought counties, the report said. And a bank's strength and performance in 1987 are important in judging how well it could withstand drought-related losses. The report, which was prepared by agency economist <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Gajewski </PERSON>, said that forecasts before the drought indicated 40 to 60 agricultural banks might fail this year, fewer than the 75 failures in 1987, which was a post-Depression high. Farm income nationally is expected to be little affected by the drought, but farmers in the drought-hit areas will suffer while others outside of those areas are expected to benefit from higher commodity prices. `` The farmers hit hardest will be unable to meet expenses this year, including repaying their local banks for farm credit used to put in this year's aborted crop,'' the report said. `` Banks in the parched counties will take unexpected hits unless federal programs rescue the farmers.'' Legislation providing emergency drought relief for farmers is currently working its way through <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` About 80 percent of the nation's agricultural banks in drought counties with above-average probabilities of failure are in the north-central drought region,'' the report said. `` Agricultural banks in the region's drought counties had a lower return on equity and a higher proportion of delinquent loans than did banks in nearby counties not hit by the drought.''

 Too much rain has slowed this summer's grain harvest in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, according to an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report. `` Rains accompanied by strong winds reportedly have caused lodging -LRB- tangling -RRB-, impeding the early grain harvest in <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> <LOCATION> U.S.S.R. </LOCATION> this year,'' the department's <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. `` Despite the unfavorable conditions, some areas are reporting excellent winter grain yields.'' As of July 18, grain and pulses, which include peas and beans, had been cut on 14.9 million hectares, of which 9.8 million had been threshed, the report said. That was below the four-year average of 23.5 million hectares cut and 18.6 million harvested by this time in 1983-86. Even so, harvest progress is ahead of the year-ago pace when the season was late and only 8.9 million hectares were cut and 5.4 million harvested by now, the report said. In all, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has around 116 million hectares for harvest this year. One hectare is equal to about 2.47 acres. The 1987 Soviet grain harvest went on to produce an estimated 211.4 million metric tons, and this year's has been forecast by <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> at 215 million tons, one of the largest on record. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels of wheat or 39.4 bushels of corn.

 <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Karoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> is ending his ground-breaking visit to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> today, calling it symbolic of the `` new era of detente'' and expressing hope that it will produce economic benefits for his country. At a news conference Wednesday night, <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> called the visit _ the first by a <LOCATION> Hungarian </LOCATION> leader in 42 years _ `` an outstanding event in our relations.'' <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> spoke a few hours after a meeting with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who said he was encouraged by the Hungarian leader's recognition that his economic reform program `` can not succeed unless accompanied by political reforms as well.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also praised <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> for his `` openness to new ideas.'' <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> was to leave this morning aboard a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presidential aircraft for <LOCATION> Niagara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> During his <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stay, he also visited <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. He described the current era of detente as `` much richer'' and `` much deeper'' than the comparable period of the 1970's. At 57, <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> is from the same generation as Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and his reform program has many similarities to the Soviet experiment. Speaking through a translator at the <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> said the accommodating atmosphere between East and West `` provides not only the superpowers but the small and medium-sized powers with the opportunity to participate in a dialogue.'' The visit was the first ever by a <LOCATION> Hungarian </LOCATION> party leader since the country came under <ORGANIZATION> communist </ORGANIZATION> rule 40 years ago. <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> became premier a year ago and was named party chief in May. During his visit, the administration agreed to allow <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> to open a trade office on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> and promised to study the possibility of improving the access of Hungarian products to American markets, <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> said. Reflecting <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s greater willingness to accept foreign private investment, <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> took part in a ceremony last week at which an <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> glass manufacturer and a Hungarian enterprise agreed to undertake a $ 115 million joint venture. He said a number of other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> firms expressed interest in investing in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> as well. Administration officials have said <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> still can not receive high technoloy <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> products because the country is a member of the Soviet-led <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> military alliance. On human rights, the officials have praised the freedom with which <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> allows its citizens to travel abroad but said there are still sharp restrictions on protest demonstrations and other forms of dissent.

The four-engine DC-6 plane, which crashed July 20 about 50 miles south of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, had been used in a $ 45 million delivery of cocaine and marijuana to <LOCATION> Grosse </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ile </LOCATION>, a community near <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> WXYZ-TV </ORGANIZATION> reported. The station, citing information gained from the federal government through the Freedom of Information Act, said the plane was owned by <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>, an official with Vortex, an aircraft sales and leasing company that has been linked to shipments of aid to the Contras, the U.S.-backed rebels in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. The aircraft was being leased for the flight from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> by <ORGANIZATION> TACA </ORGANIZATION>, a Salvadoran airline. It was carrying 22,000 pounds of assorted cargo when it crashed into a drainage canal, officials said. Cargo included seafood, handicrafts, lingerie, plants and electronics, according to <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Mascaro </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> TACA </ORGANIZATION> cargo manager at the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orleans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> TACA </ORGANIZATION> said the plane was owned by <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leasing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and was operated by <PERSON> Fiorelli </PERSON> Crews of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. The three men killed were from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>, an official with Vortex, told a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> hearing in April that he flew supplies to the Contras under a $ 96,000 contract awarded in early 1986 by the <ORGANIZATION> Nicaraguan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Humanitarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, part of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> testified at the time that he never worked for the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>. Records from the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> office show Vortex was one of about a half-dozen air freight companies used by the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and was first contracted for deliveries on Jan. 10, 1986. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> has reported that Vortex delivered non-lethal aid directly to the Contras inside <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> on three or four flights. The plane, which has had a number of different identifying tail numbers, was seized briefly by federal agents in September 1987 after it arrived at <LOCATION> Grosse </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ile </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Municipal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> with a load of drugs. <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>, a pilot who was on board the plane at the time of the bust, said he was acting as a government informant to help federal officials catch drug runners.

<TEXT>
 In the realm of national politics, where flash and style hold sway, quiet <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kassebaum </PERSON> has made it onto the list of <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential prospects through dogged study and subtle strengths. The second-term <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> senator dismisses talk of herself as a running mate for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the fall campaign, saying she does n't think she offers the proper balance _ `` in personality'' _ that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will want on the ticket. But it is her strengths, cultivated over nearly a decade in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, that apparently have brought the diminutive former <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION> housewife and businesswoman to the attention of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s advisers. On issues she chooses to dig into _ including foreign policy, national defense, the budget, transportation and agriculture _ <PERSON> Kassebaum </PERSON> spends long hours marshaling facts and mulling over arguments before taking a position. Once taken, those positions are unshakable, as the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has occasionally come to learn. Testifying this past spring before the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> platform committee in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, she spoke out firmly for the need to consider tax increases as a weapon, along with spending cuts, in the fight against the federal deficit. That puts her potentially at odds with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who has vowed never to raise personal income taxes. `` There is no way that we can cut $ 150 billion to $ 200 billion out of the federal budget,'' she stated, with unusual bluntness. `` To promise to do so is to engage in fantasy.'' Despite such principled stands, <PERSON> Kassebaum </PERSON> has few political enemies. She has an unassuming personal charm and an explosive smile that disarm opponents. And she eschews political gamesmanship and gimmicks designed to gain publicity, a determination which has gained her respect among colleagues while keeping her out of the limelight. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> strategists may see in <LOCATION> Kassebaum </LOCATION> a way of offsetting a potential weakness for their candidate, what some pollsters have referred to as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s `` gender gap.'' <PERSON> Kassebaum </PERSON> comes in for almost automatic consideration as the only Republican woman in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and one of a handful of <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> women with national standing. While sympathetic to so-called women's issues _ <PERSON> Kassebaum </PERSON> supports women's right to have an abortion and was a proponent of the Equal Rights Amendment _ she is uncomfortable leading the charge on those matters. Weighing against her selection as the vice presidential candidate are the small size of her home state _ <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> has just seven electoral votes _ and a lack of identification beyond the state's borders. Political observers doubt <PERSON> Kassebaum </PERSON> could bring to the ticket a <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> regional appeal based on farm and rural interests in the same way her <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> colleague, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, did as <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>'s running mate in 1976. Another potential minus is her soft-spoken, undynamic style, a drawback she has conceded. Seldom a participant in <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor debates, she prefers to play to her strength, one-on-one dealings with colleagues. The idea of <PERSON> Kassebaum </PERSON> on the short list for the No. 2 spot is taken seriously enough by the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> right wing that it was blasted as `` high-stakes skirt chasing'' in the conservative weekly, Human Events. The article attacked her pro-choice stand on abortion and warned that she would alienate the party's conservative wing, which already has doubts about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s claim to the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> legacy. <PERSON> Kassebaum </PERSON>'s lifetime 52 percent rating from the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> puts her in the bottom one-fourth of <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> senators, it noted. During a spring visit to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> to campaign for the re-election of Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kassebaum </PERSON> was greeted by Bush-Kassebaum bumper stickers. While flattered, she later brushed the gesture aside. `` There is a bumper sticker in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> somewhere that says, ` Honk if <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has asked you to be vice president,''' she said. `` I do n't anticipate it being offered to me. I do n't think it's the right balance, and I think I tend to have pretty good political instincts.

 If <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Brandon </PERSON> spends a lot of time puckering up, it's only natural _ after all, whistling's his work. What some professional whistlers do n't find natural, though, is the way Brandon whistles. He inhales, rather than exhales, to produce his tones. `` I also sort of pop the notes off with my tongue a lot of the time to get a more staccato effect than most whistlers use,'' <PERSON> Brandon </PERSON> said Wednesday. He does <PERSON> Bach </PERSON> and <PERSON> Handel </PERSON> pieces and jazz improvisation and will perform with the <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> Symphony next year. <PERSON> Brandon </PERSON>, 40, won the 10th International Whistle-Off contest in <LOCATION> Carson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, earlier this year and won the championship of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Whistlers </ORGANIZATION>' Convention in <LOCATION> Louisburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, for a second year in a row. He says he learned his unusual inhalation technique by accident while walking on the street on <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s South Side when he was 7 or 8 years old. `` I was whistling, and I inhaled and made a sound I'd never made before,'' he said. For a long time, <PERSON> Brandon </PERSON> studied flute at the American Conservatory of Music, but finally realized there were a lot of flute players, and only one master inhale-whistler. So, for the past 10 years, he has made his living strictly by whistling.

 A <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION> woman's sour experience with import quotas finally turned into a sweet deal, but it was only a coincidence. A convention of cake bakers is coming to town next month and <PERSON> June </PERSON> <PERSON> Melendy </PERSON> tried to pick up some special sugar, syrup and molasses shipped by two British decorators. But <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Customs officials at <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> stopped the pick up, saying sugar imports were over their quotas. `` They're artists,'' Ms. <PERSON> Melendy </PERSON> said of cake decorating experts <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> MacGregor </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Nicolas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lodge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sussex </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, who had shipped the supplies in preparation for the Aug. 11-14 convention expected to draw 1,500 cake decorators. `` They use a very fine, extra-refined sugar. They do n't like our sugar. They're just like a sculptor or painter. They prefer using their own equipment.'' Art finally prevailed Wednesday, even though the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> said it was strictly business. The department decided to relax sugar import quotas in a decision unrelated to Ms. <PERSON> Melendy </PERSON>'s dilemma, said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Conroy </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Conroy </PERSON> said officials determined that more sugar could be imported this year without injury to the domestic market. `` It just happened to work out to her advantage that way,'' he said. Ms. <PERSON> Melendy </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exploration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>'s Convention and Cake Show, said she was going to move fast retrieving the 88-pound box held since July 19. `` I'm going to run back out there and get my sugar before they change their minds,'' she said Wednesday.

<HEAD>Drought Eases In Some Areas, But West Still Dry</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Some of the most drought-parched areas of the country received a good dousing last week, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said in a generally optimistic assessment of conditions. `` Rainfall for the past week was substantial in the driest areas,'' the weather service said Wednesday in its latest drought advisory. The report said more than one inch of rainfall from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> westward into <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> had fallen and said it has been the most beneficial precipitation since early April. But the report said extreme conditions still prevail in the West, the <LOCATION> northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Rockies </ORGANIZATION>. Some locations received more than eight inches of rain, with a few areas having the equivalent of two months of normal rainfall, the advisory said. The five-day forecast through Aug. 1 calls for some heavy rain across <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and along the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, with widely scattered thundershowers along the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. But the agency said generally hot and dry conditions will spread to the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> regions. Normal rainfall is forecast for the second week in August in the lower <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> and the Southeast, with near normal or below normal temperatures. But above normal temperatures were predicted for the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. Rainfall caused the level of creeks, streams and rivers throughout the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, the middle and lower <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> and the Northeast to rise temporarily. But streamflows across the rest of the country were still very low, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Hydrological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> division of the agency. Some reservoirs reported increased storage levels, the report said, and water-use restrictions remained in effect in some parts of the country. Temperatures across the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> dropped from three degrees to six degrees below normal, although temperatures remained as much as nine degrees above normal along the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. Record high temperatures were still being reported in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> and from <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, the service said. Extreme dry conditions continued to increase the danger of fire in the far West and the northern plains and the <ORGANIZATION> Rockies </ORGANIZATION>, the service added. The report said 12 percent of the country slipped into the extreme drought category between mid-June and mid-July, with about 45 percent of the country affected by July 16. The nation's worst recorded drought was in 1934 when 61 percent of the country was put in the extreme category.

<HEAD>FDA Approves New Artificial Sweetener</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> is allowing use of a no-calorie sweetener as a table sugar substitute and ingredient in some food products. The substance, acesulfame potassium, was developed in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and is used in 20 other countries as an additive in various pharmaceutical products, some baked goods and candies, the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. Regulations permitting use of the sweetener, to be marketed in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as `` Sunette,'' take effect upon publication in the Federal Register today. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> is allowing its use in chewing gum, dry beverage mixes, instant coffee, instant tea, gelatins, puddings and non-dairy creamers. However, the Center for Science in the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interest </ORGANIZATION>, a consumer interest group, told the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> it was concerned that the sweetener may have caused tumors found in laboratory animals. But the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said the tumors were `` what could routinely be expected'' and not due to feeding with <PERSON> Sunette </PERSON>. Sunette is a product of the <ORGANIZATION> Hoechst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Celanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Somerville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Hoechst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The company did not seek <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> approval to use Sunette in soft drinks. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> deferred action on the company's request to use the sweetener in candies and other confections in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. In the past the agency has interpreted the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act as barring the use of non-nutritive sweeteners in candies. Sunette is said to be 200 times sweeter than sugar. It joins saccharin, another no-calorie sweetener, and the low-calorie sugar substitute aspartame on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> files have turned up documents stolen from a television reporter who has accused <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials in a Nicaraguan political bombing, but the agency denies knowing the material was taken illegally. Rep. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, D-Calif., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> oversight committee in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, said he will look promptly into how the agency obtained the stolen documents from <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Avirgan </PERSON>, a free-lance cameraman who worked for <ORGANIZATION> CBS-TV </ORGANIZATION> `` We've been looking into over 100 break-ins over a period of several years,'' <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` They all have a Central American angle, all relating to <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, in some cases <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.'' The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> confirmed a report in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday that the agency received memos and notes taken in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> in 1985 and 1986 from <PERSON> Avirgan </PERSON>, who was investigating a political bombing in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> that killed eight people and left him slightly injured. <PERSON> Avirgan </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Honey </PERSON>, later filed a $ 24 million damage suit in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> federal court accusing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Nicaraguan Contra officials of responsibility for the bombing. The suit was dismissed last month for insufficient evidence. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> obtained <PERSON> Avirgan </PERSON>'s files from someone reporting on people who allegedly supported `` terrorist operations in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' according to a statement released through <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Schnitzer </PERSON>. `` This individual gave no indication that the documents were obtained through illegal means,'' the statement said. <PERSON> Schnitzer </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> routinely inquires if such material is stolen, but refused to say if that was done in the <PERSON> Avirgan </PERSON> case. She also refused to identify the source. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> will cooperate with an investigation by appropriate oversight committees, Ms. <PERSON> Schnitzer </PERSON> said. The 39 pages stolen from <PERSON> Avirgan </PERSON> included memos to <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Avirgan </PERSON>'s handwritten notes about the bombing, said <PERSON> Lanny </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinkin </PERSON>, an attorney for the liberal, Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> Christic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, which represents <PERSON> Avirgan </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> lawsuit. `` It suggests that the break-in was targeted to find out what he knew,'' said <PERSON> Sinkin </PERSON>. The subject of many of the stolen memos, and later <PERSON> Avirgan </PERSON>'s damage lawsuit, was the May 1984 bombing of a news conference held by maverick Contra commander <PERSON> Eden </PERSON> <PERSON> Pastora </PERSON> in <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, just across the Costa Rican border Three journalists and five <PERSON> Pastora </PERSON> supporters died in the explosion, although <PERSON> Pastora </PERSON> was only slightly injured. <PERSON> Avirgan </PERSON> and later the <ORGANIZATION> Christic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> blamed it on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> leaders who objected to <PERSON> Pastora </PERSON>'s independent stance in the fight against <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist government. <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said the documents indicate that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> `` could have been getting the fruits of political burglaries and break-ins.'' Also Wednesday, <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Montpelier </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vt. </LOCATION>, political activist who has been involved in the <ORGANIZATION> Vermont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Non-Intervention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, said he has been the target of three break-ins in three weeks that he suspects involved the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> McElhaney </PERSON>, another <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said, `` I do n't think there have been any break-ins involving the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. ... I have no statement regarding the allegations of this person in <LOCATION> Montpelier </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>.'' Last month, the <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> reported that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> has conducted at least four investigations of opponents of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's Central American policies, including <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in Solidarity with the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salvador </ORGANIZATION>. The thefts at <PERSON> Avirgan </PERSON>'s home in 1985 and about a year later were reported to Costa Rican police at the time, but no one was ever arrested, <PERSON> Sinkin </PERSON> said. During preparations for the lawsuit, attorneys routinely asked for any documents the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> office might have on <PERSON> Avirgan </PERSON>, and the agency responded last month. `` As we went through them, it became clear they were stolen from <PERSON> Tony </PERSON>'s home,'' <PERSON> Sinkin </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Avirgan </PERSON> filed his lawsuit here in 1986, but last month Chief U.S. District Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> threw the case out, saying there was insufficient evidence. <PERSON> Avirgan </PERSON> and the institute last week gave notice they would appeal King's ruling to the 11th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>.

 Some cynics might call it a <ORGANIZATION> Mickey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mouse </ORGANIZATION> operation, but drought-beleaguered Iowans say they're honored to help the world's most famous rodent celebrate his 60th birthday with a cornfield seeded in his image. The `` birthday card'' devised by <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Productions </ORGANIZATION> is a 520-acre field in north central <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, planted in corn and oats in a profile of the cartoon legend that's visible from 30,000 feet in the air. The presentation is scheduled for Aug. 6-7, and the celebration is the latest in a series of events surrounding the farm field art that has brought cheer to some <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> communities struggling under the farm crisis of the 1980s and, lately, the drought. This time, it also may bring in some cash for economic development and community groups. <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Productions </ORGANIZATION> characters <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> and <PERSON> Minnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mouse </PERSON>, as well as <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Duck </PERSON> and Goofy, all are scheduled to appear at the fair in <LOCATION> Sheffield </LOCATION> along with `` Ear Force One,'' a 12-story-high hot air balloon in the shape of <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON>'s head and featuring a birthday hat. Organizers say the celebration could attract more than 40,000 people, providing an economic lift to the seven small communities, known as the <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION>, that surround the field. `` With the distressed economic environment and this year's drought, this is bringing smiles to peoples' faces,'' says Sheffield banker <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Lazer </PERSON> `` This is one ray of hope.'' Last fall, as <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON>'s 60th birthday approached, the Disney organization began working in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> to locate a field to plant in the shape of his head, preferably one beneath a well-traveled route of commercial airliners. With the help of <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, searchers found a farm that fit the bill, property rented by <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Pitzenberger </PERSON> and his sons <PERSON> Joe </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rick </PERSON>. Using a design developed with the help of a surveyor, <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Pitzenberger </PERSON> planted corn in the shape of <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON>'s head surrounded by oats in a day and a half last spring. He said it took just three hours longer than usual to plant the field, which has been kept alive by rain that has eluded some other areas of the state. The design consists of 6.5 million corn plants surrounded by 300 acres of oats, and it's 1.1 miles from the tip of <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON>'s nose to the end of his ear, said <ORGANIZATION> Disneyland </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> LouAnne </PERSON> <PERSON> Cappiello </PERSON>. `` It's been great,'' said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Pitzenberger </PERSON> of the attention his work has achieved, although he admits that the famous field mouse also is making the Pitzenbergers' the butt of some good-natured jokes around town. `` <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Mouse </PERSON> operation is the one we hear the most,'' said <PERSON> Pitzenberger </PERSON>. `` I tell'em I've heard it before.'' <PERSON> Lazar </PERSON> said the fair will have the usual food booths, games and concessions and will also feature a parade, a chance to have pictures taken with <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> characters and helicopter rides to view the fields. In addition, the Disney organization is providing buttons and balloons, and organizers hope to sell thousands of souvenirs, with hats priced at $ 5 and T-shirts at $ 7, <PERSON> Lazar </PERSON> said.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> war veterans driving 20 vehicles loaded with food, clothing and medical supplies have arrived in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> on the final leg of a journey their government resisted. The Veterans' Peace Convoy, comprised of 44 people, crossed the border from <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> late Wednesday, <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Reasoner </PERSON>, a leading member of the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> Living In <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, said in a telephone interview. The <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> opposes President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s policies in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government blocked the convoy from leaving the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> at least three times, saying plans to leave the trucks in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> violated a 3-year-old trade embargo against the leftist Sandinista government. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has backed the Contra rebels, who have been fighting the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>. Eight of the veterans group's members were arrested July 9 when they refused to leave the road leading to a toll booth at a <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> bridge crossing in <LOCATION> Laredo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The group finally crossed the Mexican border at <LOCATION> Nuevo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Laredo </LOCATION> on July 14. The presentation of the food and medical supplies carried by the veterans is to take place Friday in the capital. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> accepted that the food and medical supplies carried by the group qualified as humanitarian aid, exempt from the 1985 embargo.

 Their two-day strike broken by the government, hundreds of train crews returned to work today and brought service back to normal, officials of the state-run railroad said. Police said all but a dozen of the 1,463 strikers and their relatives arrested during protests at stations and railway facilities were freed after the strikers agreed to return to work. The remaining 12 jailed employees of the <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> face formal charges of neglecting their duty, police said. Engineers and other employees walked off the job Tuesday to demand higher pay and shorter hours. The government said the strike was illegal. The railroad said the strike disrupted about 90 percent of normal daily service of 2,050 trains and affected more than 1 million passengers. The strikers demanded that work hours be reduced from an average 245 hours to 144 hours a month. They also wanted a doubling of their living and other allowances. Prime Minister <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyun-jae </PERSON> said a government offer that the strikers had rejected would take effect, cutting regular monthly work hours to 224 and increasing allowances from the current $ 100 to $ 138 a month. Engineers with 10 years' experience now make about $ 1,200 a month, including allowances.

<TEXT>
 A prominent pro-PLO leader from the occupied territories called for direct talks with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> representatives and said he would even speak with hard-line Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>. In a rare dialogue with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> peace activists, <PERSON> Faisal </PERSON> <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION>' `` dream'' is to have <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> as well as the occupied lands, but they are willing to compromise and split the land to end the `` nightmares.'' `` As a Palestinian, my problem is with the Israelis _ so I must speak with them,'' <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` So we're willing to speak with <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, not because he is a a man of peace ... but because we know this man was chosen by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to represent them.'' As he spoke, dozens of anti-Arab demonstrators stood outside and protested against the forum, sponsored by the broad-based <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> peace movement, Peace Now. The <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> is banned in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, and the protesters held signs saying, `` Peace Now is a knife in the back.'' The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> refuses to recognize <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, but a recent document drawn up by <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bassam </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON> called for direct talks with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> under the auspices of an international conference. The document was criticized by extremist factions of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON> is a popular figure among residents of the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> once called him the leading <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> representative in the areas. He seemed to back <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON>'s policy. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> listeners asked him whether Palestinians will be satisfied with a state alongside <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and not try to conquer the Jewish state itself. `` Indeed, I do have a dream,'' he said. `` But I am not willing to impose my dreams upon my fellow men,'' he said. `` We will have to give up a lot of dreams _ but also a lot of nightmares.'' The statements were greeted with loud applause. <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON>, director of the East Jerusalem-based <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, was released in July from an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> jail, where he had been held without trial for nine months. Before the anti-occupation uprising began Dec. 8, he was involved in clandestine talks with <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Amirav </PERSON>, a former member of the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>, which is fiercely opposed to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, kicked <PERSON> Amirav </PERSON> out of the party over the meetings. <PERSON> Amirav </PERSON>, leftist parliamentarian <PERSON> Yair </PERSON> <PERSON> Tzaban </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> journalist <PERSON> Redwan </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Ayash </PERSON>, who was also released from jail without trial recently, addressed the unusual gathering with <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON>. It was the first public dialogue between Israelis and Palestinians in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> since the uprising started. <PERSON> Tzaban </PERSON>, of the small socialist <ORGANIZATION> Mapam </ORGANIZATION> party, called on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to acknowledge <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> nationalism and negotiate with <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> representatives. He lashed out at Labor party leader <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> for speaking as though <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> could simply return the territories to <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> seized the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> in the 1967 Middle East War.

<HEAD>Lawmakers Stuff Drought Bill With Goodies for Homefolks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Lawmakers are stuffing their $ 6.9 billion drought-relief bill full of election-year goodies for the folks back home, and some of the handouts do n't even have anything to do with the drought. One provision would provide $ 24 million to cotton growers in the district of Rep. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Combest </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>, whose crops were damaged by hail in 1987. Now, Rep. <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, R-Neb., is saying it would be wrong to confine 1987 hail payments to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> cotton `` In my district it would be very unfair to the dry edible bean people, to the sugar beet people, to the potato people,'' she said Wednesday. She wants to expand the benefits to $ 40 million. <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman E. `` Kika'' de la <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, says the same kind of scramble would have occurred even if there were no elections coming up in November. `` Every year is basically an election year in this place,'' he said. `` It happens all the time. Every time you have a bill like this every member becomes provincial and protective of his interests.'' Lawmakers say fiscal watchdogs have nothing to complain about as long as the aid does not exceed the $ 7.5 billion in farm program savings that economists believe will be generated by the drought. The bill's major provision would furnish farmers with payments equal to 65 percent of earnings lost because of damage to crops in excess of 35 percent of expected yield. It also would provide expanded government feed benefits to dairy and livestock producers. But that only scratches the surface. Under heavy debate is a provision to increase the dairy price support level by 50 cents for each hundred pounds of milk. This boon for milk producers and dairy cooperatives is the brainchild of Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeffords </PERSON>, R-Vt., who is running for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> from a state that is a major source of the <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION>'s milk supply <PERSON> Jeffords </PERSON> says the action, which would raise consumer prices by a few cents a gallon, is needed for avert milk shortages. Critics scoff at that claim, citing government forecasts of ample milk. But <PERSON> Jeffords </PERSON> stands his ground. `` It is our duty to assure an adequate supply of milk,'' he declares. If his plan falters, an alternative that would make the increase temporary is being sponsored by Reps. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Gunderson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Wis </LOCATION>., and <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Penny </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Minn </LOCATION> The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, pushing its own version, has incorporated a provision that would aid manufacturers of ethanol, the alcohol fuel made in part from corn. It would allow ethanol makers to buy government surplus corn at 110 percent of the price the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> paid. Much of the surplus was acquired long before drought sent prices zooming. The provision could mean a government subsidy of as much as $ 2 million a month for domestic ethanol manufacturers, including the <ORGANIZATION> Archer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daniels </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Midland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Decatur </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, which makes the lion's share of domestic ethanol But Sen. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Daschle </PERSON>, D-S.D., the sponsor, says the idea is to provide corn to a variety of small ethanol companies in danger of going broke. `` ADM does n't even want this amendment,'' <PERSON> Daschle </PERSON> said. He said a $ 2 million benefit would represent `` a small fraction of what their capacity is to produce.'' He said junking the plan could actually help <ORGANIZATION> ADM </ORGANIZATION>, which is a hefty contributor to campaigns of <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> members _ <PERSON> Daschle </PERSON> included. `` You know what they'd get if they do n't get this?'' said <PERSON> Daschle </PERSON>. `` As I understand it, if all these small plants closed, they'd -LRB- ADM -RRB- get all the business.'' When the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> was first drafting its bill a few weeks ago, Rep. <PERSON> Harley </PERSON> <PERSON> O </PERSON>. Staggers Jr., D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, tacked on a provision to allow the secretary of agriculture, on a discretionary basis, to pay half of seeding costs for drought-burned But as the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> was putting finishing touches on the bill, Rep. <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, D-Ala., won approval of a change that would flatly require the government to pay half of the bills The measure also could prove a boon to the fertilizer industry because 50 percent of fertilizer costs would be paid under the Harris amendment. De la <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> called for junking the plan after staff economists estimated a $ 1.2 billion price tag. Meanwhile, Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Schuette </PERSON>, R-Mich., is planning an amendment that would provide federal loan guarantees for drought-stricken farmers He says he is still unsure of the price tag. `` Would it cover peach orchards? Would it cover apple orchards?'' Rep. <PERSON> Delbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Latta </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ohio </LOCATION>, asked at Wednesday's Rules Committee session. That there is something for almost everything in the bill became clear when de la <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> was asked exactly which types of livestock would be covered by the measure's feed provisions. He thought for a moment and then, smiling broadly, said: `` Cows to catfish and anything in between.''

<HEAD>Lyng Urges Drought Lawmakers: Drop $300 Million Boon for Dairy</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is speeding $ 6.9 billion in drought assistance toward President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s desk, with <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> calling on lawmakers to jettison a $ 300 million benefit for milk producers. `` We strongly object to the provision which would increase the price support level for milk and urge the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to strike this provision from the bill on the floor,'' <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> said Wednesday. In a letter to <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman E. `` Kika'' de la <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, the secretary dismissed dairy industry claims that the price boost is needed to head off a looming milk shortage. And he placed the cost of the increase at $ 300 million _ more than double the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> estimate. `` We do not expect milk shortages next year,'' <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> said as both the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> prepared to act on their versions of the measure to provide aid to farmers hard hit by the drought. Farm lawmakers plan to meet in a <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> committee </ORGANIZATION> next week to fashion the final product and send it to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> before Aug. 11, when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> flees <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s summer heat. At the core of both versions is a payment program that would provide drought-stricken farmers with compensation equal to 65 percent of crop losses beyond 35 percent of their expected harvest. The plan also would streamline and expand federal feed benefits for dairy and livestock producers. Under heavy fire from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration _ and a host of rival farm and business groups _ is a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> provision that would increase the dairy price support level on Oct. 1 by 50 cents for each 100 pounds of milk to $ 11.10. Both bills would cancel a 50-cent cut in the price-support level that otherwise would be automatic under the farm program. Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeffords </PERSON>, R-Vt., sponsor of the increase, and Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Stenholm </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, have been urging the idea as a way of heading off a milk shortage next year Anticipating an intense fight over the <PERSON> Jeffords </PERSON> provision, dairy supporters have readied a fallback provision that would put in place a temporary price-support increase. The plan sponsored by Reps. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Gunderson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Wis </LOCATION>., and <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Penny </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Minn </LOCATION>., was reportedly gaining steam in the Meanwhile, Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, a persistent critic of excess spending on agricultural programs, called for barring farmers with $ 1 million in revenue from receiving drought benefits provided by the legislation. `` I'm suggesting that if they are that successful they probably do n't need a subsidy,'' the <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> lawmaker said. <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON> said his amendment would deny benefits to farmers if their gross revenues totaled $ 1 million, even if their net earnings were far less. Under the relief bill, payments would be made for losses of a wide variety of crops, including an estimated $ 150 million for tobacco. Tobacco-state lawmakers acknowledged that it thus represented a step away from the 1983 compromise between farm lawmakers and anti-smoking forces under which the tobacco price-support system is supposed to have no net cost to the taxpayer. `` It's because of the special situation of the drought,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.C. </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> tobacco and peanuts subcommittee. `` To be providing $ 150 million because a crop that kills people is damaged and spending less than 1 percent of that on educating people about the hazards of tobacco is really an example of having priorities upside down,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Banzhaf </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, director of Action on Smoking and Health, one of the nation's major anti-smoking organizations.

 A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> sailor killed his wife by throwing her into shark-infested waters off the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>, a military prosecutor told an American court-martial. Petty Officer <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Elmore </PERSON>, 26, of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, is charged with premeditated murder in the the March 1988 death of his Philippines-born wife, <PERSON> Bella </PERSON> <PERSON> Fe </PERSON>. <PERSON> Elmore </PERSON>, who is stationed in <LOCATION> Exmouth </LOCATION>, has pleaded innocent. Military officials refused to release <PERSON> Elmore </PERSON>'s hometown. A judge and jury, all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military officers, flew in for the trial, the first court-martial for an American in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> since World War II. In her opening statement Wednesday, government prosecutor Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Philemina </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> acknowledged the case was circumstantial because no trace of the body was recovered. `` There is, simply, nothing left of Mrs. <PERSON> Elmore </PERSON>,'' the prosecutor said. Ms. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said <PERSON> Elmore </PERSON>'s statements changed as investigators questioned him about the March 16 disappearance. Ms. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said she would prove <PERSON> Elmore </PERSON> and his wife argued and then drove to the <LOCATION> Exmouth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pier </LOCATION>, 500 miles north of <LOCATION> Perth </LOCATION>, where `` somehow she just fell and rolled off the pier into the water.'' `` Instead of going to help her, <PERSON> Elmore </PERSON> went home and went to bed,'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. `` He figured his wife could swim back to the end of the pier and walk the 10 miles back home.'' Ms. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said she would produce 38 witnesses and evidence about marital problems, including testimony that <PERSON> Elmore </PERSON>, after drinking, was overheard to say he would like to cut up his wife and throw her to the sharks. `` It is something he had been planning ever since he decided he was sorry he married her,'' Ms. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. `` This was a premeditated murder of his wife _ a wife he had grown tired of.'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said that because of <PERSON> Elmore </PERSON>'s work as a boatswain's mate, he knew about tides in the area and that the waters were shark-infested. `` That is why he was so sure he would never see <PERSON> Bella </PERSON> again,'' she said. The case is continuing.

 A newlywed says she and her husband were `` blinded by love'' 3 -LCB- months ago when they disappeared from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, sparking a manhunt after their deserted car was found ransacked with its engine running. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON>, 23, and his wife, <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON>, 22, said they dashed off to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> shortly after they eloped because some relatives apparently disapproved of their skipping a traditional marriage ceremony. They also said they just wanted to spend time together. `` Call it shortsighted or call it what you want to, but love is blind and I know that sounds trite,'' Ms. <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON> said at a news conference after being reunited with her parents, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> MacLean </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Haddonfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> `` So much has come out of it that has been great, but then to see the look on my mother's face ... and my dad's face. ... I mean, I ca n't stand the hurt that I've caused,'' she said tearfully. The newlyweds vanished April 2 without telling relatives or classmates at a suburban Evangelical college. During a resulting three-state police investigation, friends at <ORGANIZATION> Wheaton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> held prayer vigils, put up posters and questioned people at roadside restaurants and gas stations. `` We are tremendously sorry for the hurt and the pain we've caused to our families, to our friends and loved ones and relatives,'' <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON> said `` We never realized that the story would have the ramifications it has.'' The couple left their car near a police station with the keys under the mat and their identification cards, <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON> said. `` We did n't want to be traced.'' The BMW was found ransacked in an alley, its motor running. Police eventually determined that the couple had planned to vanish, but families and friends feared foul play. The MacLeans said they followed the uproar over their disappearance through front-page stories in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> newspapers at a university library. Meanwhile, they both got jobs at a suburban La Jolla delicatessen. They were not seen or heard from until they sent letters to their parents and contacted the MacLeans by telephone Tuesday. `` We hoped to let things die down a bit, to let the investigation settle. Then we could slip in unnoticed,'' <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON> said. `` We were afraid to come back and we felt we had done the right thing to begin with. We needed to wait on our decision until the right time within ourselves to come back,'' he said. <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON> said his family's reaction to the wedding was in part responsible for their decision. He said they eloped `` simply for the spiritualness of it and not for the wedding ... the large production of it. `` We were n't clear-minded why we did what we did, but in the time of what we did it seemed the best thing to do.'' His wife said, `` We're so in love and we wanted to get away from the adornment and the material world and develop our relationship together apart from that. And we did that and we're so much stronger as a result of it.'' Her parents arrived in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> on Wednesday afternoon. <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON> said he had contacted his parents, who were vacationing. `` Obviously we're excited and thrilled to be here together,'' said <PERSON> MacLean </PERSON>, standing beside his wife, daughter and son-in-law. Asked if he was upset with his daughter and son-in-law, <PERSON> MacLean </PERSON> said, `` I'm a father. I do n't think they ran from us.'' <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> Police Cmdr. <PERSON> Ettore </PERSON> <PERSON> DiVito </PERSON>, who headed the investigation, said police may try to recover the costs of their efforts. `` We are disheartened that we'd expended so many man-hours,'' he said, but added, `` As far as I know, there is no criminal activity involved in the case.'' <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON> said he `` will bear responsibility for all that has happened.'' The couple said they were n't sure whether they would return to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON> had been scheduled to graduate in May. Ms. <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON>, a junior, was set to graduate in December. In <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, news of the couple's reappearance shocked but delighted their friends and those who took part in the police search, which encompassed parts of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brandt </PERSON> said he handed out leaflets in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> that sought leads on the disappearance. He said he was n't bitter _ just baffled. `` That's not the approach I would have taken,'' <PERSON> Brandt </PERSON> said. `` It's definitely unique, though.''

<HEAD>Study Of Fur Mutation In Mice Could Aid Understanding Of Skin
Cancer</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BAR HARBOR, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An investigation of an unusual genetic mutation that changes the pigmentation of mice could offer insights into the development of a deadly form of skin cancer in humans, a researcher says. <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> <PERSON> Brilliant </PERSON>, a geneticist at the <ORGANIZATION> Jackson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>, said Wednesday the technique he developed to study the mutation in mice also could be used to study genetic mutations in humans. `` It's a way to get at many mutations of potential medical importance to humans,'' said Brilliant. The mutation in mice affects the pigmentation of cells called melanocytes. Studies of the mutation may help explain how melanocytes develop normally, he said. `` You have to know how this works normally to know what goes wrong in cancer,'' said Brilliant, who did the research in connection with <PERSON> Eva </PERSON> <PERSON> Eicher </PERSON>, another geneticist at <ORGANIZATION> Jackson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION>. When the growth of melanocytes goes awry in humans, the result is melanoma, a skin cancer that is often fatal. Furthermore, Brilliant said, the study of the mutation in the melanocyte pigmentation gene could help researchers understand other genetic defects. `` The information from this line of research is being applied to gain access to a closely linked gene which, when mutated, causes cleft palate in mice,'' Brilliant said. Whether that will help explain the occurrence of cleft palate in humans is not known, Brilliant said. The mutation Brilliant studied in mice is called the pink unstable mutation. It has the highest mutation rate of any gene known in mammals. Up to one in 10 of the offspring of a parent with the pink unstable mutation will suffer a new mutation of the gene, Brilliant said. The gene is related to pigmentation in the mice. When the gene is normal, mice are black. When the gene is mutated, the mice are cream-colored with pink eyes. But one in 10 to one in 40 of the offspring of the cream-colored, pink-eyed mice will have black patches of fur, Brilliant said, as the gene mutates again, reverting back to its original form. If such mottled mice are bred again, some of their offspring will be black as the gene further reverts to its normal form. Melanoma is caused by mutations in genes that affect the development of pigment-carrying cells, and thus these mouse studies may someday help doctors understand how melanoma arises, Brilliant said. Brilliant studied the mutation using a new technique he developed in which he looks for variations in repeating pieces of genetic material that are scattered throughout the mouse's genes. Similar examination of repeating pieces of genetic material in human genes can be used to find genetic mutations in humans, he said.

 Concern about AIDS has not decreased sexual activity among unmarried women since 1982, but has helped increased their use of condoms, a nationwide survey suggests. Seventy-six percent of unmarried women ages 18 to 44 were sexually active last year compared with 71 percent in 1982, the survey estimates. The study was conducted by <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> Darroch </PERSON> <PERSON> Forrest </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Alan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guttmacher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, which studies fertility issues, and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Fordyce </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Ortho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pharmaceutical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Raritan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J </LOCATION>. It appears in the current issue of the institute's publication, `` Family Planning Perspectives.'' The paper says the estimates should be accurate within 2 percentage points, but <PERSON> Forrest </PERSON> said that estimates of sexual activity may be low. The researchers compared 1982 and 1987 nationwide surveys commissioned by <ORGANIZATION> Ortho </ORGANIZATION>. The surveys asked a variety of questions about contraception and included married and unmarried women. For 1987, questionnaires were completed by 60 percent of unmarried women who received them, giving data from 2,465 women. Researchers estimated that for unmarried women ages 18 to 44, 15 percent have never had sex and 9 percent have had only infrequent sex, leaving 76 percent considered sexually active, <PERSON> Forrest </PERSON> said. The same kind of calculation yielded the 71 percent for 1982, she said. Increases in sexual activity may mean young adults believe they can avoid getting acquired immune deficiency syndrome through sexual contact, that they can judge a person's health by appearance and that they are protecting themselves by choosing only apparently healthy people as partners, researchers said. The study also found that condoms were used by 16 percent of unmarried women ages 18 to 44 and at risk for unintended pregnancy, an increase from 9 percent. Researchers cited publicity about the condom's effectiveness in preventing spread of sexually transmitted diseasese, especially AIDS. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kegeles </PERSON>, a research psychologist at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, said Wednesday she is not surprised by the reported levels of sexual activity. `` I think heterosexuals are just not feeling terribly at risk for AIDS,'' she said. She called the reported increase in condom use `` terrific'' and said the trend must continue. Men and women should feel they can tell a partner they insist on condoms as a routine matter, she said. <PERSON> Forrest </PERSON> said despite the condom trend, the 1987 level of use remains low. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Tew </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Guttmacher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, said the study focused on women because `` that's all we have data on.''

<HEAD>Vice President Plans to `Open Up' Personal Side in Campaign</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in an interview published today that he plans to `` open up and share'' his personal side in the presidential campaign to counter his image as an `` Ivy League elitist.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the certain Republican nominee, told the editorial board of <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION> that his family life has been `` something so private and so special that I have n't felt like sharing it.'' `` At this level of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> politics, I have to open up a little and share, so at our convention, you will see five <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> children, their five spouses and our 10 grandchildren,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in the interview, which took place Wednesday. Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` speaks Spanish. I wish I did,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` But I have three grandchildren, my blood coursing through their veins, who are half Mexican. I've never shared this.'' He said the thoughts about his family's public role were raised by the recent Democratic National Convention, where <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, former contender <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and others spoke of family values and appeared publicly with relatives. `` We saw a good show there in terms of family. Very good, from the heart, genuine,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` I have n't felt too comfortable talking about my family.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the public perceives him as an Ivy League elitist, but he resists that mold. `` For example, I like pork rinds, but that does n't fit the mold. I play horse shoes.'' Asked about Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s refrain at the Democratic convention of `` Where was <PERSON> George </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he was on the job. `` I was up at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, laying in perspective what ought to happen: The Iranians doing that which they had been unwilling to do, recognize the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolution and talk peace.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> represented the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> government last week at a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> meeting on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> downing of an Iranian commercial airliner carrying 290 people. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has since said it will recognize a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolution calling for a cease fire in the Iran-Iraq war. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> dismissed Democratic criticism of his role in the Iran-Contra affair as `` politics, nothing more.'' `` Remember the ridicule about ` moderates' in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>? Now others are talking about the moderates in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the newspaper. The vice president also called <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> a `` loose cannon'' when asked whether <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> should have a role as an envoy to free hostages in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. `` It should n't happen. We're talking about very sensitive foreign policy. The administration is empowered to conduct those negotiations at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. We do n't need any loose cannons rolling around the deck,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said.

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said she wo n't see a <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and hopes it will never come to pass, and she rejected calls for uniform taxes and a central bank for the 12-nation <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, in a radio interview Wednesday, said officials proposing a federal government for <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> `` spend far too much time talking about these airy-fairy ideas. `` They say ` Let's have European union.' I say ` What do you mean, because I ca n't see any of you dissolving your own countries into a <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>','' Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said. The 62-year-old prime minister said a <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> would `` never come in my lifetime and I hope never at all.'' It was her most outspoken criticism yet of what she regards as impractical overenthusiasm for a European federation. She spoke on the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Jimmy Young Show,'' a mixture of chatty interviews and popular music aimed mainly at housewives. <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Delors </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>'s Brussels-based executive commission, refused to comment on the interview <PERSON> Delors </PERSON>, in a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> on July 6, predicted that within 10 years 80 percent of social and economic legislation in the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> area would be passed on a Europe-wide basis rather than in the national parliaments of the member states. But Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, long accused of an insular attitude toward the rest of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, said in the Wednesday radio interview: `` I think he was wrong. I think he went over the top. I do n't think he should have said it.'' Last week, the prime minister replaced <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> commissioner, <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> <PERSON> Cockfield </PERSON>, who was masterminding an alignment of sales taxes throughout the trading bloc _ a move Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> opposed. Alignment of taxes is part of preparations for 1992, when the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> is due to become a single market without trade barriers. As for an <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> central bank, she said, that would mean surrendering `` fundamental economic decisions to another country.... That I will not do. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> argued she is simply being practical about the limits of a <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> union, which she said could never function like the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` The whole history of the two places is entirely different,'' she said. `` It is not possible to have a <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. What is possible is for the 12 countries of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> steadily to work more closely together on things we do better together, so that we can trade better together.'' Opinion polls show British voters are less enthusiastic about closer ties within the EEC than, for example, the West Germans or the French.

 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> early today ended a grueling 16 -LCB- - hour session by approving a far-reaching bill described as the most significant change in banking law since the Depression The bill, if adopted by the full <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and signed into law by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, would allow bank holding companies to underwrite virtually every type of security except corporate stock. However, the legislation includes a laundry list of other provisions banks strongly oppose, including new obligations to serve poor people. And, because of the election-shortened legislative calendar and the jurisdictional rules of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the bill faces an uncertain future. The committee voted for the final measure 30-20, with all but three Democrats in favor and all but three Republicans opposed. From the banking committee, it goes to the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, chaired by Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mich </LOCATION>., who has expressed skepticism of banks entering the securities business Depending on what kind of deadline <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, sets, <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON> could kill the bill through delay or exact concessions by threatening delay. After Aug. 12, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> plans to be in session only from Sept. 6 to Oct. 5, leaving little time for a banking bill to pass the full <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and be reconciled with legislation that passed the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, 94-2, on March 30. Banks long have sought to re-enter the securities business, from which they have been barred by the Depression-era Glass-Steagall Act for more than 50 years. As originally drafted by the committee chairman, Rep. <PERSON> Fernand </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> St </PERSON> <PERSON> Germain </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, the bill would not have permitted bank holding companies to underwrite mutual funds or corporate bonds later convertible to stock. However, those provisions were added by 35-14 and 27-23 votes, respectively. Other securities activities permitted by the bill include the underwriting of corporate bonds, commercial paper, municipal revenue bonds and securities backed by mortgages and other consumer debt such as auto loans. Rep. <PERSON> Chalmers </PERSON> <PERSON> Wylie </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, the ranking Republican on the committee, failed in an attempt to persuade the committee to move more slowly. `` This bill will have a greater impact than any other piece of legislation since the reforms passed nearly 60 years ago,'' <PERSON> Wylie </PERSON> said. `` I believe the changes should be made cautiously and not all at once.'' He also sought to kill provisions described as pro-consumer that banks would be required to accept in exchange for the new powers. He argued that the requirements would hurt the soundness of the banking system and ultimately cost consumers. Republican opposition to the consumer sections threatened committee passage of the bill until an hour-long negotiating session behind closed doors after midnight. Democrats agreed to accept some watering down of the consumer provisions and, in exchange, three Republicans _ <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hiler </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridge </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> _ voted in favor of the bill. It requires banks to serve poor people by providing low-cost lifeline checking services for accounts between $ 25 and $ 1,000. And, it requires banks to open special accounts for the cashing of government checks such as Social Security and welfare checks, with a cashing charge of no more than $ 2. It also requires banks to show a good record of serving poor communities in their lending area before getting permission from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> to exercise new powers. However, in an exemption sought by the Republicans, agricultural banks with less than $ 50 million in assets _ about 2,600 of the nation's 14,000 commercial banks _ would be exempted from the last requirement. Also, the limit on the size of government checks that banks would be required to cash was lowered from $ 3,000 to $ 1,500. Other provisions opposed by banking interests include a two-year moratorium on further bank expansion into the real estate business, a ban on banks moving into insurance underwriting and severe limits on the number of banks that can sell insurance underwritten by other companies. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Yingling </PERSON>, chief lobbyist for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said it was too soon to say if the banking industry will support the legislation. `` The bill improved considerably during the -LRB- committee session -RRB- but it still has a number of major problems, including ... some very burdensome consumer provisions,'' he said. Toward the end of the long session, which began at 10 a.m. Wednesday and ended at 2:30 a.m. Thursday, several committee members dozed in their chairs. The final compromise on the consumer provisions left committee members bleary-eyed and a bit giddy. When the committee defeated an amendment that would have required banks to offer special savings accounts for children, one member shouted, `` It's a good thing the little devils are all in bed.'' <ORGANIZATION> St </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Germain </ORGANIZATION>, after the final committee vote, exclaimed, `` Hallelujah!''

 The first international chess master to be beaten by a computer says he wants a rematch before the machines become invincible against humans. `` I'd like to try for revenge while I can. The way they're improving ... one has the feeling that in a few years they will be much better,'' <ORGANIZATION> Penn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> math professor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Formanek </PERSON> said Wednesday The No. 1 seed in the tournament was defeated here Sunday for the <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chess </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> championship by <PERSON> Hitech </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mellon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> creation that played its first game in May 1985. <PERSON> Hitech </PERSON> was the first machine to become a senior master, the top national title before international ranking, according to the tournament director. `` It played some flashy moves in the end game. That's where it played like a human,'' said <PERSON> Formanek </PERSON>, who has played chess 28 years. The computer appeared to dally for 10 or 15 moves then committed itself to a tactic that seemed questionable but proved to be a winner, he said. `` I can see why it waited,'' <PERSON> Formanek </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Carnegie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mellon </PERSON> computer researcher <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Berliner </PERSON>, faculty adviser to <PERSON> Hitech </PERSON>'s team of student handlers, said the machine `` played beautifully'' against <PERSON> Formanek </PERSON>. `` I was n't real impressed with its play. I thought it could have played a little more interesting types of games. It grinds them out,'' said tournament director <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Magar </PERSON>, a chess master. `` There are times when it makes moves that I have to shake my head at,'' <PERSON> Magar </PERSON> said. `` Sometimes they're just dull moves. Other times it plays some positions that human players would say ` That's too risky.' Hitech's new rating of 2,405 points makes it a senior master. It is the first computer to earn the title and the first to defeat an international master in tournament play, <PERSON> Magar </PERSON> said. The computer, which finished in a tie for first place in the 1987 state championship, is unlikely to gain international status, because the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chess </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> `` is n't real happy about computers playing chess,'' <PERSON> Magar </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Chess </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>, which sanctioned the state tournament, recognizes the machines in its standings but also accommodates tournaments whose organizers ban the electronic players, he said. <PERSON> Berliner </PERSON> claims Hitech is superior to other chess computers because it can recognize patterns among various clusters of pieces on the board. `` Together with its blinding speed, that accounts for its success,'' he said. Hitech reviews the possibilities for moving its pieces each turn. The computer can consider about 160,000 possibilities every second and may consider 20 million different moves before dictating on a printer the next move, said <PERSON> Berliner </PERSON>, who moved the pieces in the state tournament. The machine is a university project in artificial intelligence, but <PERSON> Hitech </PERSON> is far from being able to reason and to learn. `` That's too hard,'' <PERSON> Berliner </PERSON> said. `` To be able to learn you have to be able to conceptualize and all that.''

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s executive secretary confirmed today that <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> offered to pay $ 5 billion to return home, but said her staff recommended that the offer be rejected. Executive Secretary <PERSON> Catalino </PERSON> <PERSON> Macaraig </PERSON> told reporters he believed the offer was a ploy by the deposed president to avoid criminal indictment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` We saw it for what it was,'' Macaraig said. `` It was just a ploy to get his <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> indictment against him suspended ... I recommended the rejection of the five billion dollar offer.'' <PERSON> Macaraig </PERSON> did not say whether Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> accepted the advice. On Wednesday, she told reporters <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> should send the money first `` and then we'll talk.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has refused to allow <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and his family to return from <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, where they fled after a February 1986 popular uprising toppled his 20-year administration. Her government alleges that he stole about $ 10 billion from the <ORGANIZATION> Phillipines </ORGANIZATION>' treasury. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Village </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> reported this month that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> had recommended that <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and his wife <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON> be indicted on fraud and conspiracy charges in connection with acquisition of real estate in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> confirmed later that the White House had asked to be consulted before the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> sought any indictment against <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. In a statement Tuesday from <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> said `` negotiations'' about his return were taking place, but denied he had offered to pay the money in exchange for permission to return to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> with immunity from prosecution. But <PERSON> Macaraig </PERSON> said the offer by the ousted president was relayed earlier this month by <PERSON> Emmanuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelaez </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Macaraig </PERSON> said <PERSON> Pelaez </PERSON> told him he had been approached by two Americans about the <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> offer and relayed it to <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. Macaraig identified one of them as <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McGregor </PERSON>, a political science professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Macaraig </PERSON> said he could not remember the other American's name. On Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professor <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON> said the $ 5 billion offer was in a proposal brought to him by a <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> representative and was part of the `` substance'' of a letter to him from <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. `` I was approached last month in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> by a representative of former President <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> with a list of proposed ` agreement points' for an arrangement which would allow his return to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON>. The points were `` conditioned by an offer on his part to accept the legitimacy of the Aquino government, stay out of politics, throw his support behind <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> and provide her government with $ 5 billion,'' <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON> added. <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON> identified the <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> emissary as <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> advertising man. <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON> declined to comment on <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' denial. A source close to the discussions with <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, insisting on anonymity, said the ousted president's statement appeared worded to provide him deniability. <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON> is president of the Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>, a non-partisan <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> organization promoting democracy abroad and was a member of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> observer team to the 1986 Philippine elections. <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> returned on July 13 with two letters signed by <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, one addressed to President <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> and one addressed to <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON>, `` which outlined what I view as Mr. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' personal petition to the Philippine government'' said <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON>. `` I sent President <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s letter to <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, assured that it would reach her, along with the substance, including the $ 5 billion figure, of what was contained in the letter to me,'' <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON> said. A source knowledgeable of the Weinstein-Hoffman contacts said the $ 5 billion was explicitly mentioned in <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' letter to <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON> but not in the one to President <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Speculators Flee Falling Commodity Markets; Inflation Outlook
Improves</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Investors who jumped into the agricultural commodity markets when the Midwestern drought became apparent last spring have been scrambling for the exit doors since the weather changed for the wetter, analysts say. With crop conditions either static or improving, prices for future delivery of grains and soybeans have dropped off sharply. `` This is not a good market for speculators anymore,'' said <PERSON> Katharina </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmer </PERSON>, grain market analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The drop in crop futures prices has spilled over into the livestock and sugar futures markets, prompting some economists to lower their month-old projections for 1989 food inflation from about 7 percent to 6 percent or less. That may be good news for consumers but it's not much consolation for the speculators who bet on rising crop prices and failed to collect when the markets peaked late last month and early this month. The ensuing decline accelerated last week into a tailspin that ended Tuesday with soybeans for August delivery at $ 7.55 -LCB- a bushel, a 31 percent drop from the contract's high of $ 10.93 -LCB-, reached June 23. The value of a 5,000-bushel soybean contract plunged nearly $ 17,000 during the period. August corn settled Tuesday at $ 2.87 -LCB- a bushel, down 21 percent from its high of $ 3.64 on July 5. The reason for the collapse: rain. After 2 -LCB- months of unseasonable heat and little water in the Corn Belt, the Midwestern weather suddenly turned friendly to the struggling crops about two weeks ago. Five days of scattered showers were followed by cool temperatures, more rain and more cool weather. The change `` turned this market on a dime,'' said <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Feltes </PERSON>, chief grain market analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Refco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a large, Chicago-based speculative trading firm. `` Trees do n't grow to the sky, and this certainly is a reminder of that old trading adage,'' <PERSON> Feltes </PERSON> said. `` Things do n't go up forever.'' Soybean futures best illustrate the rise and fall of the agricultural commodities because the nation's relatively small soybean stockpile has made that market extremely sensitive to changing weather patterns during the growing season. Speculative interest in soybeans began mounting in April after the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> predicted <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soybean inventories would total about 290 million bushels when the new marketing year begins Sept. 1, down from 436 million bushels a year earlier. On April 4, August soybean futures settled at $ 6.80 a bushel on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. Speculators who bought in at that price and sold just before the market peaked realized enormous profits. They could sell today and still come out ahead. Analysts say the biggest losers were speculators who bought into the soybean market at about $ 9 a bushel in mid-June and were determined not to sell until prices topped $ 11. Soybeans never went that high and by the second week in July, those investors were losing money on paper. Many have been forced to sell at a loss. `` People bought on emotion rather than on supply and demand and, lo and behold, those speculators are out now,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Gelderman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> trading firm that caters to commercial processors of grain.

 Rioters fatally stabbed three people in the western state of <LOCATION> Gujarat </LOCATION>, where a police strike entered its fourth day today and prompted officials to call out the army, the <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> reported. The stabbings occurred Wednesday night in <LOCATION> Godhra </LOCATION>, 465 miles southwest of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>, the news agency said. The identities of the victims and the motive behind their slayings were not immediately known. The strike by state police was called after the government on Sunday ordered the arrest of union leaders who were demanding higher wages and better benefits. Officials accused the leaders of inciting a police rebellion. The policemen walked off the job Monday in <LOCATION> Ahmedabad </LOCATION>, an industrial city 18 miles south of <LOCATION> Gandhinagar </LOCATION>, the state capital. The strike later spread all over the state and units of the federal reserve police and other paramilitary forces were ordered to take up routine police duties. Policemen in 138 out of the state's 426 police stations joined in the strike, the sixth by <LOCATION> Gujarat </LOCATION> police in nine years, the government said. The policemen are asking for a monthly $ 75 wage hike. A constable earns about $ 142 a month. At least 83 policemen have so far been dismissed and 23 arrested on charges of indiscipline.

<HEAD>Space Shuttle Test-Firing Delayed Until Monday</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HOWARD BENEDICT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A faulty valve and other technical problems have forced another 24-hour delay, until Monday, of the critical launch pad test-firing of space shuttle Discovery's three main engines. `` We got behind in the schedule and never made up the time,'' <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Malone </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday. `` We wanted to be sure we were clean when we went into the tanking.'' The tanking refers to the loading of half a million gallons of propellant into Discovery's external fuel tank during the first of a two-part countdown leading to the test-firing. The fueling was rescheduled for tonight, with the countdown then set to move down to 10 seconds before a mock liftoff on Friday morning. At that point, a simulated problem is to force a `` launch'' postponement, and the launch team is to empty the fuel tank, start a new countdown, refill the tank and aim for the engine firing at 7:30 a.m. Monday. The 20-second ignition will test modifications made to the engines since the explosion of shuttle Challenger on Jan. 28, 1986, and is considered essential to certifying Discovery for the first post-Challenger shuttle flight. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> is moving ahead with the test-firing while still attempting to fix a small gas leak in a vent line associated with a steering engine that is separate from the main engines. Engineers hope to be able to make a repair without taking Discovery off the pad and into a hangar, a move that could delay the launch, now officially set for early September, as much as two months. Officials concede that even if the leak can be fixed on the pad, the launch likely will slip into the second half of September. Several on-pad repair approaches have been tested, and the engineers appear to be favoring one in which a 20-square-inch hole is cut in the rear wall of Discovery's cargo bay. Cutting the hole would enable them to reach the otherwise-inaccessible leak, which is in an engine compartment. They could either tighten the fitting or enclose the leak with a clamshell device filled with an epoxy sealant. Specialists still are testing a method in which a device resembling a badminton shuttlecock would be pushed into the 27-foot-long vent line trailing a sealing agent. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> could select one of the methods as a prime candidate as early as today. But no decision on whether or not to roll Discovery off the pad will be made until after the main engine firing.

<TEXT>
 New Teamsters President <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> said in a 1984 conversation that he needed permission from a reputed organized crime boss before he could advance in the union, the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Times reported today. In addition, <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>'s name was mentioned at a meeting between reputed <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> mobster <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> `` Fat Tony'' <PERSON> Salerno </PERSON> and alleged <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> mob figure <PERSON> John </PERSON> `` Peanuts'' Tronolone, in a discussion secretly monitored by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, the newspaper said. The report was the first public indication of any links between organized crime and <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, who was chosen a few weeks ago by the union's executive board to succeed <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Presser </PERSON> as president. <PERSON> Presser </PERSON> died this month while under indictment on payroll padding charges. <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> had told <PERSON> Presser </PERSON> he wanted to be general secretary-treasurer of the union, but needed the approval and backing of <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> L.S </PERSON>. <PERSON> Patriarca </PERSON>, the late reputed head of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> mob, according to an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> memo obtained by the Times. The April 19, 1984, memo was addressed to <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Revell </PERSON>, then-assistant director in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s criminal investigative division. It said that <PERSON> Presser </PERSON>, an informant on mob matters for 10 years, had told <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents that he had the conversation with <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> in early April 1984. <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> has declined to comment about the matter. A spokesman, <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> <PERSON> Zeller </PERSON>, said Wednesday that <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> may have a statement this week. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> memo has remained secret since it was drafted but is expected to be introduced soon in federal court by government lawyers to help support a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawsuit that seeks the ouster of top Teamsters leaders on grounds of corruption. The lawsuit was filed the day <PERSON> Presser </PERSON> died. An <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> transcript of the electronically monitored meeting held in May 1984 quotes Tronolone as telling <PERSON> Salerno </PERSON> that <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> might be worthy of <PERSON> Salerno </PERSON>'s support for secretary-treasurer, considered the second most powerful position in the union, the Times said. In this meeting and another FBI-monitored meeting in June 1984, <PERSON> Salerno </PERSON> listens to brief talk about <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> but does not indicate he has reached any conclusion or will back anybody for the job, the Times said. <PERSON> Presser </PERSON> eventually selected <PERSON> Weldon </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mathis </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> as secretary-treasuer. The newspaper, citing unidentified sources, said <PERSON> Presser </PERSON> personally cleared that appointment with <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moody </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> official to whom <PERSON> Presser </PERSON> sometimes reported in his role as an informant.

 <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s Vietnam-installed government and delegates of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas clashed at peace talks that ended today, and a settlement of the 9-year-old civil war remained elusive, participants said. One participant, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Suppiah </PERSON> <PERSON> Dhanabalan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, said the four Cambodian factions remained `` quite far apart'' after four days of informal talks. The talks brought together <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, the nominal coalition of three guerrilla groups opposing its occupation of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> government, and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s close ally, <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>. Also attending were representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, which backs the guerrillas: <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Brunei </LOCATION>. Working groups of senior officials of all the parties are to be set up to discuss specific issues. By year's end, the groups are to make recommendations on holding another round of talks. The guerrilla leaders were <PERSON> Khieu </PERSON> <PERSON> Samphan </PERSON> of the communist <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>; Son <PERSON> Sann </PERSON> of the non-communist <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>; and Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Ranariddh </PERSON>, representing his father, former Cambodian monarch Prince <PERSON> Nordom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> maintains more than 100,000 troops in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> to fight the guerrillas, but has pledged a total pullout by early 1990. That led to the <LOCATION> Bogor </LOCATION> talks and an anxious search for a political solution to prevent a bloodier civil war. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s delegate, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Co </PERSON> <PERSON> Thach </PERSON>, said he was `` half happy'' with the talks. `` We are determined to have a political solution before the end of 1990,'' he said. A closing statement by the host, <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Alatas </PERSON>, said all participants agreed on the urgent need for a political settlement leading to a neutral and non-aligned <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. It said they also agreed on withdrawing Vietnamese forces, preventing `` the recurrence of genocidal policies and practices'' of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> regime, and ending foreign arms supplies to the warring parties. The participants also agreed on the need for definite timetables and an international presence to supervise these processes, the statement said. But <PERSON> Khieu </PERSON> <PERSON> Samphan </PERSON> said in a statement that it was a `` shameless lie'' to claim the groups agreed on a wide range of issues. His statement also appeared to reject any linkage between the pullout of Vietnamese troops and steps to prevent the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> from returning to power, although it said the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> agreed that no single faction should have power. It said <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> must withdraw from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> unconditionally. The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> killed at least a million people in its attempt to impose radical agrarian communism when they ruled <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> from 1975 until <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> invaded in late 1978 to end bloody <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> attacks on its western border. The group is the strongest of the three guerrilla groups and reportedly is storing arms for an offensive in 1990. <PERSON> Alatas </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dhanabalan </PERSON> called the talks `` a very important psychological breakthrough'' _ the first time all the parties talked face-to-face. However, <PERSON> Dhanabalan </PERSON> added: `` The points were made with smiles, with soft words, and very diplomatically. ... -LRB- but -RRB- if I look at the substance, I am less sanguine. I think more effort is needed.'' He said at least two Cambodian factions `` are still quite far apart ... They basically reiterated old positions. `` Unless there is a genuine attempt on the part of the Cambodian factions, especially two of the factions, to compromise on the issues and be ready and willing to share in the power structure of a future <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, it will be difficult to make progess.'' <PERSON> Dhanabalan </PERSON> did not name the two parties, but <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON>, prime minister of the <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> government, told a news conference of his strong disagreements with the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>. `` My party, <LOCATION> Son </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sann </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Ranariddh </PERSON> have made efforts to find common ground,'' he said. `` It was a pity that the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> rejected our proposal. `` We proposed a national reconciliation council with <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> in charge, but the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> rejected it,'' he said. `` We accept political participation of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> in any political solution but not the participation of their army.'' In a peace plan presented Monday, the first day of talks, <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> called for `` elimination'' of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> leadership and `` dissolution'' of its armed forces. <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> also announced today he would meet <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> in October for a third round of separate talks. No significant progress was made at their meetings in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> last December and January, and <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> later canceled a third round scheduled for April in <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, who is considered central in any future Cambodian government, resigned July 10 and refused to attend the <LOCATION> Bogor </LOCATION> talks. But he met Wednesday in <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION> with his guerrilla partners and <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> and issued another peace plan, which <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> said he would give `` due consideration.''

 Two popular American films are showing in the Soviet capital this week as part of a project aimed at improving understanding between the superpowers at top governmental levels. `` E.T.'' got a warm reception when it made its Soviet debut Wednesday night before a select audience of 450, and also at a packed showing later for the general public at the 2,400-seat Oktyabr cinema, said <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Semenov </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Filmmakers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. Members of the Supreme Soviet, the national parliament, were invited for the first screening of the <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Spielberg </PERSON> fantasy about a relationship between a young boy and a displaced alien creature. The second American film, to be screened tonight, is `` Coming Home,'' in which actor <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Voight </PERSON> won an Academy Award for his portrayal of a paraplegic Vietnam War veteran. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> were invited to watch two Soviet films that have drawn more than 2 million Soviet viewers over the past month _ `` The Cold Summer of'53'' and `` Commissar.'' `` Cold Summer'' depicts the trauma that followed dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s death, when political prisoners and criminals alike were freed in an amnesty. `` Commissar'' was banned in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for 20 years, presumably for its sympathetic portrayal of a Jewish family. The exchange was arranged by a private group of filmmakers from both countries who call their joint project the American-Soviet Film Initiative. `` This film exchange is a great opportunity for the leaders of our two nations to see how films in our respective societies deal with controversial issues,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> director <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schiller </PERSON>, chairman of the initiative group.

 An Army private infected with the AIDS virus was acquitted of aggravated assault charges for having sex with three other soldiers, but was sentenced to two months' confinement on two lesser counts Pvt. <PERSON> Adrian </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 28, of <LOCATION> Caseyville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, was found guilty Wednesday by a military judge of one count of conduct bringing discredit upon the Army for having sex after his superiors counseled him against it. The judge also found him guilty of one count of sodomy with another male private. He had been accused of threatening the lives of three soldiers, including two women, by having unprotected sex with them although he had tested positive for the AIDS virus. `` I'm glad it's over,'' said <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, who in March 1987 became the first member of the military to be charged with AIDS-related offenses. He said he had anticipated a harsh sentence if convicted `` because of the emotion surrounding'' the case and `` the disease itself.'' But the judge, <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> Col. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>, deliberated less than 20 minutes before acquitting <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> on three counts of aggravated assault and two counts of conduct bringing discredit on the military. `` I am convinced the accused never intended to harm any of his sexual partners,'' <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said. `` By God's good grace, and blind luck, no one was infected. Cole sentenced <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> to two months' confinement at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huachuca </LOCATION>, where he has been restricted for the last 15 months, ordered him to forfeit $ 1,200 in pay over three months, gave him a bad-conduct discharge and ordered him not to have unprotected sex. Col. <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Beans </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, whose office prosecuted <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, said he was trying to `` figure out the judge's logic with our failure to prove an aggravated assault. Quite frankly, I thought we did it, I thought we made our case.'' But Beans added that he was n't `` down'' on the verdict. `` We're talking about a human being, a young soldier here, and it really is a tragedy. <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said the government's theory about aggravated assault of a sexual partner was `` revolutionary, but not well established.'' The judge found <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> innocent of aggravated assault involving his former fiancee, Specialist <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Pruitt </PERSON>; a soldier identified pseudonymously as Pfc. <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Doe </PERSON>; and then-Pfc. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baldwin </PERSON>, along with conduct charges involving the latter two soldiers. The judge indicated that when <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> had sexual contact with <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Doe </PERSON> and <PERSON> Baldwin </PERSON> in late 1986, he was not aware that AIDS could be transmitted through exchange of bodily fluids. But Cole found <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> guilty of the single conduct charge for resuming unprotected sex with <PERSON> Pruitt </PERSON> in January 1987, even though he had been given detailed counseling for soldiers who have tested positive to the human immunodeficiency virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Before sentencing, <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, through a statement read by a defense lawyer, apologized to his parents `` for all the embarrassment I have brought to the family -LRB- and -RRB- to all I have hurt.'' He added, `` I never meant to harm -LRB- anyone -RRB-.'' <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> said that on learning of being HIV-positive in 1986, `` my first decision was to be celibate. But I soon realized this was not realistic.'' Before the sentencing, two sergeants testified on <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>' behalf, praising his work and character Legal issues delayed his trial and military courts have tried other AIDS-related cases in the interim.

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said its soldiers today crushed a force of Iraqis and Iraqi-backed Iranian rebels in two days of fighting it said left 4,000 invaders dead or wounded. `` The combatants of Islam were able to inflict heavy blows on the aggressive enemy and mercenaries of world arrogance,'' said an <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> dispatch monitored in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. It said the fighting around the western city of <LOCATION> Eslamabad </LOCATION>, 60 miles from the Iraqi border, continued against `` remnants of the enemy troops'' who were `` surrounded by Iranian combatants.'' The Iranian rebel group, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, earlier said in communiques released in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> that its fighters seized <LOCATION> Eslamabad </LOCATION> and the city of <LOCATION> Karand </LOCATION>, killing or wounding 30,000 Iranian troops. The claims could not be verified because foreign reporters are allowed into battle areas only on rare guided tours. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s foreign minister, <PERSON> Tariq </PERSON> <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON>, met with <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>, and continued to insist on direct negotiations with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> for a cease-fire in the nearly 8-year-old war. <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> said before the meeting with <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> `` shall not be stampeded into making a hasty step.'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> agreed last week to a year-old <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> cease-fire resolution already supported by <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s air force jet fighters and helicopters today `` heavily pounded'' the invaders, whom it called `` Iraqi troops and the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Munafiqeen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Khalq </ORGANIZATION> members.'' That was a reference to the <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Khalq </ORGANIZATION>, Baghdad-based Iranian rebels opposed to <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s Islamic fundamentalist government. In a play on words, the state-run Iranian media often refer to them as the `` munafiqeen,'' the <LOCATION> Farsi </LOCATION> word for `` hypocrite.'' The agency gave the casualty figure and reported that 1,500 Iraqi troops were killed or wounded in fighting Wednesday near the southern port city of <LOCATION> Khorramshahr </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Riza </PERSON> <PERSON> Jafer </PERSON> <PERSON> Zada </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Khalq </ORGANIZATION> rebels based in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, said Wednesday in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> that its fighters shot down two Iranian warplanes and a helicopter gunship in the central sector of the warfront. During previous actions said to involve the <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Khalq </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has declared that Iraqi soldiers fought the battles and allowed the rebels to take the credit. No independent observers have seen the battles. The rebel offensive emerged Monday from an <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> invasion that began on Friday, but the rebels apparently advanced while Iraqi troops were withdrawing. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio said earlier Wednesday that `` Iraqi troops'' entered Eslamabad in the morning. `` The battle in the region is continuing with utmost intensity and the initiative lies with the combatants of Islam,'' it said. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, which says it is leaving all Iranian territory it occupies, did not comment. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said its jet fighters on Wednesday flew 205 sorties, including an attack on a Hawk missile battery east of the <LOCATION> Karun </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, and helicopter gunships flew 73 sorties. A <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> military communique said 15 armed Iranian boats tried to approach an Iraqi naval ship and three were sunk in the ensuing battle, but it did not say where the encounter took place. Iraqi warships are not known to have operated in the gulf for years. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> warplanes dropped chemical bombs near <LOCATION> Bakhtaran </LOCATION>, a provincial capital in the central region. The Iranians frequently accuse <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> of using chemical weapons, which are banned under the 1925 <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> Convention. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has acknowledged their use, but claims <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> introduced chemical weapons to the war.

<HEAD>Government Suspends Plans Requiring Journalists To Register</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GREG MYRE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government today temporarily suspended regulations that would require some journalists to register or face penalties that include imprisonment. The regulations, which were to take effect Sunday, drew heavy criticism from media groups here and abroad that accused the white minority government of making further inroads against press freedom. <PERSON> Stoffel </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, minister of home affairs, said the registration of journalists `` remains a matter of grave concern for the government,'' but that the regulations had been temporarily suspended for `` practical considerations.'' He said the regulations would be reviewed, but gave no indication when he would make a final decision. The broadly worded strictures say anyone carrying out `` news-agency'' business must register with the government or face a 10-year prison term or a $ 8,500 fine. Lawyers say the definition of a `` news agency'' is so broad that major commerical papers that exchange stories, church and political groups that publish newsletters, and businesses that issue regular press statements on their operations could be included if the government so desired. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s largest news agency, the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, and all major international agencies, including The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, were exempted from the regulations. But local journalists who supply news on a part-time basis to some of the world's major news organizations would be required to register if they work for more than one employer, which many do. Under the regulations, <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> would be able to remove journalists from the registration list and prevent those people from working in the profession if he objects to their reporting. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> already has broad censorship powers that allow him to close down publications and expel foreign journalists. The latest regulations appear aimed at the small, local news agencies around the country. But most news organizations operating in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> receive reports from the local agencies and would be affected as well. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> has accused the local agencies of endangering public safety by reporting unfavorably on police activities, forced removals of poor blacks and labor disputes in rural areas that are not covered regularly by any other news organizations. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correspondents </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has said that even journalists not required to register would be `` compromised'' because they would be seen as having favored status with the government. State-of-emergency regulations already in force restrict reporting about unrest, security force actions, treatment of detainees, some forms of protest and a broad range of statement the government considers subversive. Under apartheid, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

<HEAD>Director of Illinois Arts Council Admits False Resume Claims</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> has admitted making false claims on the resume he used when seeking the $ 55,000-a-year post, and has been placed on an unpaid leave of absence. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON>, 38, claimed on the resume that he had been a `` principal dancer'' with <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Joffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Ballet </PERSON>, and that he was a `` guest artist'' on a public television series, `` Dance in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' in the 1970s. In an interview with the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday, <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> initially maintained that he had appeared with <PERSON> Joffrey </PERSON> in national tours, but later admitted he had never been a member of the company in any capacity, only attended workshops run by the troupe, the newspaper reported today. `` I was never featured in `` Dance in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` The <PERSON> Joffrey </PERSON> was the one that did ` Dance in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.' So I lied.'' <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> was acting director for several months before being named last month to replace <PERSON> Adrienne </PERSON> <PERSON> Nescott </PERSON> <PERSON> Hirsch </PERSON>, who resigned to work for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> had been the Illinois agency's deputy director since 1985. <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> said it was the first time he had used false information to get a job. `` I'm really embarrassed,'' he said. `` I should n't have done it.'' The board of the state agency put <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> on unpaid leave Wednesday, officials said. `` Truthfulness is the issue,'' said <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Madigan </PERSON>, board chairwoman. She said a board executive committee may discuss how to deal with the matter by Friday. The council runs on an annual budget of $ 8 million, of which about $ 6.5 million is distributed to 2,000 individuals and groups statewide.

<TEXT>
 A conservative former general and wealthy businessman today announced his nomination as prime minister after <PERSON> Prem </PERSON> <PERSON> Tinsulanonda </PERSON> declined to seek a return to the post he's held for eight years. <PERSON> Chatichai </PERSON> <PERSON> Choonhavan </PERSON>, 66, the likely prime minister-to-be, told a news conference: `` The five political parties that will form the coalition government have agreed to support the leader of the largest party and as that party's leader I am pleased to accept the nomination.'' Students and others who for three days staged rallies opposing <PERSON> Prem </PERSON>'s non-elected status welcomed <ORGANIZATION> Chatichai </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement and said they will stop protesting. <PERSON> Chatichai </PERSON>, one of five acting deputy prime ministers, said he met with <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> chief Gen. <PERSON> Chavalit </PERSON> <PERSON> Yongchaiyudh </PERSON> and `` got military support.'' He would not elaborate, but the military traditionally has wielded considerable power in Thai politics. If <PERSON> Chatichai </PERSON> succeeds <PERSON> Prem </PERSON>, he is expected to follow a conservative pro-Western policy and emphasize economic development. <PERSON> Prem </PERSON>, 67, made no public statement today. On Wednesday, the acting prime minister was quoted as saying he was stepping down for personal reasons. He turned down an offer from the leaders of the five key political parties, which formed a loose pro-Prem coalition after no single party could capture a majority in Sunday's parliamentary elections. <ORGANIZATION> Chatichai </ORGANIZATION>'s Chart Thai -LRB- Thai Nation -RRB- Party and the coalition partners hold 215 of the 357 seats in the lower house of Parliament. The other four parties in the coalition are the <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Rassadorn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Chatichai </PERSON> said he will submit to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> a list of 215 coalition signatures that show support for his succession to Prem. Parliament President <PERSON> Ukrit </PERSON> <PERSON> Mongkolnavin </PERSON> said the list would be handed to constitutional monarch King <PERSON> Bhumibol </PERSON> <PERSON> Adulyadej </PERSON> later today for approval. A royal decree announcing the new prime minister was expected today or Friday. <PERSON> Chatichai </PERSON> held several ministerial portfolios in past governments, including those of foreign minister and minister of industry. <PERSON> Prem </PERSON>, a former army commander, brought stability during his tenure and until Wednesday did not say whether he would return or not. He has been criticized for indecision and a willingness to fashion compromises. Student leader <PERSON> Mana </PERSON> <PERSON> Treelayatewat </PERSON> said there will be no further anti-Prem demonstrations. `` Chatichai represents the people who voted him into the government and we respect that,'' <PERSON> Mana </PERSON> said. Mana, the vice secretary-general of the 100,000-member Students Federation of <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, said in a statement that for the first time in 10 years `` democracy can be developed and mature in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>. We have reached our goal: premiership from direct elections, not nominations.''

<TEXT>
 The mayor who directed police to `` shoot-to-stop'' fighting in a park has rescinded the order, saying it was a scare tactic to prevent hoodlums from taking over the city. `` I was going to lift the order anyway,'' Mayor B.A. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` I just did it a day early. I think we got our point across.'' After a Sunday brawl among youths using sticks as weapons, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> told police officers to `` shoot from the waist down'' anyone caught fighting in the park. He said he issued the order to get the attention of `` hoodlums'' from the <PERSON> Wadley </PERSON> area who were making a fighting ring of the 12-acre Hope Williams Memorial Park in this east-central <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> city of 2,500 residents. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, who once ordered police to shoot burglars and also ordered them to shoot stray dogs, said as part of the attempt to stop brawls in the park the fine for fighting was going to be increased from $ 71.50 to $ 125. `` Certainly they -LRB- police -RRB- did not plan to shoot anybody,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` I had not intended to shoot them anyway. It was issued temporarily. I did n't think it would take very long for those young people to get the idea we meant business. `` It is merely to warn and to threaten and to let them know they are not going to take over the city.''

 Scattered showers and thunderstorms fell from <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state today after spitting out large nuggets of hail and generating winds up to 63 mph that downed trees and power lines. A lightning bolt from a cloudless sky Wednesday afternoon hit two boys playing softball just northeast of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, melting one boy's tennis shoes and sending both to the hospital, officials said. Several other boys suffered minor injuries. `` It was just one bolt, but it was so strong and so fierce that it hit those two boys and all the others got the aftershock,'' said <LOCATION> Bexar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff's patrolman <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Talamentez </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Vietnamese-Americans Plan Joint MIA Searches</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> appear ready to intensify efforts to search together and account for 1,761 Americans still missing from the Vietnam War, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> said today. An embassy statement said experts from both countries meeting over the past four days discussed plans to work `` on concerted efforts within the next three months to make significant progress'' to resolve the divisive issue. The two sides, which met in <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>, reviewed `` arrangements for joint investigative, survey and excavation activities'' during the period. The statement described the meetings as `` quite productive, and we look forward to greatly expanded cooperation in coming months.'' Members of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> team, which returned from <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> today, will discuss implementation of the joint searches in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the statement said. The Vietnam War ended in April 1975 with a communist victory over the U.S.-backed South Vietnamese government. In recent months, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has made significant moves to resolve the MIA issue. It said this month that it would try to resolve 70 `` priority cases'' this year and welcome more joint excavations of warplane crash sites. Facing a ruinous economy and shunned by the non-communist world for its invasion of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> has been making efforts at building some bridges to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other western and Asian nations. <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> has withdrawn some of its forces from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and participated in the Indonesian-sponsored talks to find a political solution to the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> conflict. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> technical team to the <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> talks was led by Lt. Col. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Casualty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resolution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> and was joined by representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Identification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION>. Both units are based in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. The talks were agreed upon during a meeting at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> June 8 between Foreign Minister <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Co </PERSON> <PERSON> Thach </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and retired Gen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vessey </PERSON>, who last August reached an agreement with <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> for an accelerated search for MIAs, especially the 70 on <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s priority list. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in turn promised to consider <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s humanitarian problems The priority cases are those the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> considers most easily resolvable because it says the Vietnamese have information on them. These include cases where there are photographs of airmen taken after their capture during the war. Since the <PERSON> Vessey </PERSON> agreement, <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> has on five occasions turned over to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> remains it identified as those of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> servicemen killed in the war. The last turnover, involving 25 remains, was on July 13. Since the war ended, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has returned more than 150 sets of remains that the army laboratory confirmed as those of Americans. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> says it has returned the remains of 241 Americans and information on 45 others whose remains were `` determined to be no longer in existence.'' <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has denied charges by some <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> private citizens that it is holding live Americans as prisoners.

 The secretary-general said he was `` very sober'' on prospects for securing a truce in the Iran-Iraq war after the first day of peace talks. <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> also pressed <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> on the issue of Western hostages held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said its soldiers today crushed a force of Iraqis and Iraqi-backed Iranian rebels in two days of fighting. It said 4,000 enemy soldiers were killed or wounded. The <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said the fighting around the western city of <LOCATION> Eslamabad </LOCATION>, 60 miles from the Iraqi border, continued against `` remnants of the enemy troops'' who were `` surrounded by Iranian combatants.'' In his first full day of separate truce talks with the belligerents' foreign ministers, <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> met for two hours Wednesday with both <PERSON> Tariq </PERSON> <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, which has continued attacks on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> despite <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s acceptance last week of a year-old <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> cease-fire resolution, still wants face-to-face talks with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and will not be `` stampeded'' into a settlement. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> announced that it would honor Resolution 598 almost immediately after the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> passed it last summer. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said he raised with <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> on Wednesday the issue of the 18 foreign hostages, half of them American, believed held by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem militants in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` This is a question on which one has to be very discreet,'' he told reporters afterwards. `` I raised it very, very specifically.'' He did not disclose the Iranian envoy's response, and <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> did not answer questions about the hostages. Earlier Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> chief told reporters he thought the Iranians `` might assert their possible influence in order to have this problem out of the way'' for `` humanitarian and political'' reasons. The Peruvian said he presented to both sides Wednesday the same ideas for implementing a cease-fire in the 8-year-old war and was `` very sober'' in his assessment of progress. No formal meetings were scheduled for today. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said he could not require direct talks if <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> objects. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has refused face-to-face negotiations but has left the door open to a request by the secretary-general. <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> said that if <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> does not accept direct talks `` that means that they are not sincere about peace.'' Some diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s stubbornness, its continuing military offensive and its alleged use of outlawed chemical warfare were hampering negotiations They noted that <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> described his official visit with the secretary-general as a `` courtesy call,'' while <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials said it was `` substantive.'' Iranian Ambassador <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ja'afar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahallati </PERSON> charged that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> was procrastinating and sabotaging <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peace efforts. He said <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> was using chemical warfare, and he lodged a protest with the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. `` How can we take the Iraqis seriously when ... they are using chemical weapons?'' <PERSON> Mahallati </PERSON> told reporters. The Iranians frequently accuse <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> of using chemical weapons, which are banned under the 1925 <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> Convention. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has acknowledged their use, but contends <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> introduced chemical weapons to the war. <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s parliament speaker and military commander, offered on Tuesday to help get the nine American hostages freed if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> releases Iranian assets frozen since 1979. The White House said `` no deals.'' <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> said Wednesday he believed the secretary-general's `` good offices could help ... Things are changing.'' Asked about <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>'s statement and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> response, <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> said: `` We maintain the policy that we do not pay blackmail. <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> said he has visited <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> five times to discuss the matter and `` the important thing for us is to liberate the hostages in such a way that they wo n't be replaced by another group of hostages.'' The longest held hostage is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 40, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. He was kidnapped in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on March 16, 1985. After a string of military setbacks, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> announced on July 18 that it would accept Resolution 598, which the 15-member <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> passed unanimously on July 20, 1987. The resolution calls for a truce, withdrawal to recognized borders, prisoner exchange, peace negotiations and an investigation to determine which side started the war. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> invaded <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> in September 1980 after several border skirmishes.

 Authorities closed one of the nation's six universities indefinitely following violent clashes between rival student political groups, police said today At least 10 students at <ORGANIZATION> Rajshahi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> were injured Wednesday in the clashes and nearly 100 dormitory rooms were ransacked, police said. The students also set fire to furniture and books, they said. The trouble erupted when more than 100 supporters of the fundamentalist <ORGANIZATION> Jamaat-e-Islami </ORGANIZATION> party raided the campus and clashed with supporters of an eight-party alliance led by the country's main opposition leader, Sheikh <PERSON> Hasina </PERSON>, a district official said The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the <ORGANIZATION> Jamaat </ORGANIZATION> supporters were armed with iron rods, sticks and knives.

 <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>' most impoverished school system will be managed by <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> under a plan officials say could help `` redirect education in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' Under the plan approved Tuesday by the <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chelsea </LOCATION>, a blue-collar city of 26,000 north of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> BU </ORGANIZATION> will serve as an unpaid consultant for about six months. If the plan works out, the university will manage the schools for a decade. `` We see it as the place to begin educational reform,'' said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` We hope <ORGANIZATION> BU </ORGANIZATION> will bring the cutting edge of educational technology to <LOCATION> Chelsea </LOCATION>. We have all the problems of a large urban center but we're small enough so the effects will be measureable.'' <PERSON> Chelsea </PERSON> school officials say the city is the poorest in the state in per capita income. The school system has low reading test scores and one of the highest teen-age pregnancy rates in the state. <ORGANIZATION> BU </ORGANIZATION> wrote a 300-page report outlining a 10-year plan to reduce dropout rates and improve teaching in the 3,300-student system. `` We could be model for the country,'' said <ORGANIZATION> BU </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Greer </PERSON>, a director of the program. `` It's perfect for the national reform movement _ we're stressing a lot of teacher and parental involvement. If other universities want to do this, they can come to us and see the results. We're putting our reputation on the line with this.'' The university plans to review the curriculum, attempt to raise teacher salaries and focus heavily on early childhood education, <PERSON> Greer </PERSON> said. He estimated the annual cost of the plan at $ 2 million and said <ORGANIZATION> BU </ORGANIZATION> will seek federal grants and corporate sponsors. University faculty and staff will advise the school administration on `` everything from appointments and curricula to school buses,'' said <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON>, who conceived the plan. `` This is the first step to redirect education in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' he said.

<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>

 The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> laboratory at <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> says it has closed for reorganization after being cited by the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> for more than 150 errors, mostly involving AIDS and hepatitis screening. The faults were detected between January 1987 and June 1988, <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonough </PERSON>, chief operating officer of the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bi-State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chapter </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday. He said 152 blood donations collected during the 18-month period required further investigation and of that total, 96 donors were re-evaluated for AIDS or hepatitis. `` All 96 re-tested negative to initial screening tests, and medical history evaluations determined that none were involved in high-risk activities,'' he said. But he said five showed `` indeterminant'' results. These donors, and the six patients who received their blood products, will be monitored for the next few months to determine any health hazards, <PERSON> McDonough </PERSON> said. He said the donors and patients involved had been contacted. Other FDA citations involved faults in computer systems, administrative systems and records. <PERSON> McDonough </PERSON> said the mistakes were mostly a result of human error and said disciplinary measures have been taken. `` With the help of the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> we have made appropriate corrections,'' he said. `` To protect the health of patients who rely on <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> blood, we are committed to a standard of zero errors.'' <PERSON> McDonough </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> will temporarily transfer its lab work to a private laboratory in <LOCATION> Round </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, and a quality control office will be established under the direction of a <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> vice president. The Missouri-Illinois region is one of 56 regional blood service operations in the country. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> supplies half of the nation's need for blood and blood products, <PERSON> McDonough </PERSON> said. Each year more than 4 million volunteers donate over 6 million units of blood to more than 1.5 million patients, he said.

 A woman who as an infant was strapped to her mother's back while she hijacked an airliner to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> confirmed the identification of her mother as a fugitive 19 years later, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents say. <PERSON> Dakeeta </PERSON> <PERSON> Grinage </PERSON>, 20, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, confirmed for investigators that an old photograph of a woman known as <PERSON> Haziine </PERSON> <PERSON> Eytina </PERSON> was really that of her mother, <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Grinage </PERSON>, who was wanted on air piracy charges, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Grimaldi </PERSON> said Wednesday. <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Grinage </PERSON>, 39, had been at large since the 1969 hijacking of an New York-to-Miami flight with 146 people aboard. The hijackers, a male and a female, held a 2-year-old boy hostage and forced the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> pilot at gunpoint to fly to <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION>. A baby strapped to the woman's back was <PERSON> Dakeeta </PERSON> <PERSON> Grinage </PERSON>, said <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Flanagan </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said the hijackers were <PERSON> Grinage </PERSON> and her then-husband, <PERSON> Tyrone </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellington </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON>, who died in 1971 from gunshot wounds suffered in a bank robbery attempt. The suspect was arrested Monday. Police said she was living for at least the last five years in <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION> under the name <PERSON> Haziine </PERSON> <PERSON> Eytina </PERSON>. If convicted, she could be imprisoned for 20 years to life. `` She was concerned that her mother was injured,'' <PERSON> Grimaldi </PERSON> said of <LOCATION> Dakeeta </LOCATION>. `` She made the comment of ` why does she have to be treated as a common criminal?''' She also said, `` would n't you be upset if your mother had just been arrested?'' <PERSON> Grimaldi </PERSON> said. The woman's lawyer, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilford </PERSON>, said police relied on a `` sketchy, vague description'' to arrest her and had no photographic evidence until after taking her into custody. <PERSON> Wilford </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents were `` basically not asking, but telling'' <PERSON> Grinage </PERSON>'s daughter that the woman in the picture was her mother. `` They have not sufficiently established to the court that Mrs. <PERSON> Eytina </PERSON> is <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Grinage </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Wilford </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Grinage </PERSON>, who has five children with <PERSON> Mylo </PERSON> <PERSON> Eytina </PERSON>, worked as a teacher's aide for a preschool program, according to the federal Head Start program. `` For 19 years she's led a law-abiding life,'' <PERSON> Wilford </PERSON> said. `` She's been a stalwart person.''

<HEAD>Jordan Cancels Big West Bank Development Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AMMAN, Jordan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government said today it was canceling a $ 1.3 billion development plan for the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, which was part of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> before 1967. The move followed reports in regional newspapers that King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> was dissociating himself from the Palestinian question. State-run Radio <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> said the kingdom also decided to `` dissolve all development and tender committees for this plan.'' The five-year <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> development plan was set up in 1986 by joint agreement between the Jordanian government and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. It was to provide schools, water and agriculture projects and welfare. The <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> was under Jordanian rule until <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured it during the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. However, <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> continued to pay the salaries and pensions of many goverment employees there, and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> representatives sit in the kingdom's <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. The uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, which began Dec. 8, has given new international prominence to the Palestinian issue. On Wednesday, the Saudi Arabian newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Al-Sharq </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Al-Awsat </ORGANIZATION> quoted Jordanian Prime Minister <PERSON> Zaid </PERSON> <PERSON> Rifai </PERSON> as saying `` decisive developments'' in <LOCATION> Jordanian-Palestinian </LOCATION> relations were coming up. <PERSON> Rifai </PERSON> was quoted as saying the measures planned would be in response to the wishes of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and the Arabs and sprang from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s desire to give greater responsibility to the Palestinians. On the same day, the Kuwaiti newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Al-Qabas </ORGANIZATION> said royal court Minister <PERSON> Marwan </PERSON> <PERSON> Qassem </PERSON> was the strongest candidate to head a new <ORGANIZATION> Jordanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> at the start of radical changes in the Jordanian administration. The comprehensive changes in <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> would be made in light of a decision by <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> to dissociate himself from the Palestinian question and let the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> shoulder the responsibility, said the newspaper, which is usually well-informed on <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. Al-Qabas, in its Amman-dated dispatch, said the changes could include the appointment of <PERSON> Rifai </PERSON>, the prime minister, as personal representative for the Jordanian monarch. The newspaper, in line with earlier reports in the Arab news media, reported that <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> would dissolve the two houses of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. The 60-member upper house includes 30 members from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>.

 The drug and racketeering case against reputed mobster <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Gotti </PERSON> ended in a mistrial for the second time after the jury deadlocked over whether the government had tampered with tapes of bugged conversations. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> declared the mistrial Wednesday in the case against the 41-year-old brother of reputed Gambino crime family boss <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gotti </PERSON>. Two other reputed mob figures also were on trial. `` I'm fairly well satisfied that we have reached the Rubicon. The time has come to declare a mistrial,'' the judge said. The trial began 10 weeks ago. The jury foreman said jurors were troubled by a defense claim that tape recordings, made from an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> bug placed in the kitchen of one of the defendants, <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruggiero </PERSON>, might have been tampered with to fit the case. The jurors' identities were not released for their own protection. `` The jurors finally indicated their problem with the evidence is, in fact, tampering,'' said <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ruggiero </PERSON>'s lawyer. `` We only hope the court system will recognize this situation and correct it by dismissing the case so these defendants do not once again have to undergo criminal proceedings.'' Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> LaRusso </PERSON> denied there was any tampering. The first trial ended in a mistrial in January _ nine months into the case _ with prosecutors accusing the defendants of jury tampering. Prosecutors said there would be a third trial; <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> set Sept. 7 as the tentative date. The jury had considered charges of heroin possession, obstruction, conspiracy, racketeering and running a continuing criminal enterprise. <PERSON> Gotti </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stream </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ruggiero </PERSON>, 48, of <LOCATION> Cedarhurst </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Carneglia </PERSON>, 43, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> are charged with supervising a multimillion-dollar heroin-smuggling operation. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON> said the charge of jury tampering in the first trial was under investigation.

 A <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> oral surgeon who injured his right hand in a fall from a horse during a polo lesson has accepted a $ 6.3 million settlement. Dr. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Glassman </PERSON>, 37, agreed to the terms Tuesday as his suit against the operators of <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equestrian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> was to be heard by a jury. Attorney <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Girardi </PERSON> said <PERSON> Glassman </PERSON> can no longer practice surgery. <PERSON> Glassman </PERSON> was taking a private polo lesson in 1984 when he fell off his rented horse. In the suit, he claimed that the center was negligent because a saddle strap snapped and the saddle loosened as he tried to hit the ball. The strap that broke had been repaired earlier with a staple instead of stitching, the suit charged. <PERSON> Glassman </PERSON>'s right hand suffered so much nerve damage that he can no longer grasp anything without pain, <PERSON> Girardi </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Hast </PERSON>, an attorney for <ORGANIZATION> Equestrian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, operator of the city-owned facility, said an economist and an accountant were ready to testify that <PERSON> Glassman </PERSON> would have earned $ 7 million to $ 8 million during his lifetime if not for the injury.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, over the protests of two subcommittee chairmen, has given its blessing to a land deal that would bring taxpayers 108,000 acres of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> swampland for a valuable piece of downtown <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>. Sent to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday was legislation to authorize the exchange, which was negotiated initially by the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and redrawn by <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> lawmakers to bring their state a slice of the action. The deal could cost the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> some $ 100 million, according to Reps. <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Yates </PERSON>, D-Ill., chairman of the Appropriations interior subcommitee, and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>., chairman of the Interior water and power resources <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> and <PERSON> Yates </PERSON> came up on the losing end of the 281-125 vote that approved the legislation sponsored principally by <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Udall </PERSON>, D-Ariz., normally allied with <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> on committee issues The bill would authorize the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to complete a complex deal to dispose of the 111-acre site of the <ORGANIZATION> Phoenix </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, which the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration wants to close because of declining enrollments. The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, the investigative wing of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, has described the <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> land as perhaps the most valuable undeveloped piece of urban real estate in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. Under the plan, the <PERSON> Collier </PERSON> family interests of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> would get 68.4 acres of the <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> property in exchange for the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> acreage and a cash payment of at least $ 34.9 million. The transaction also calls for the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> to get 11.5 acres of the school property to expand its <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> hospital; <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> to get 20 acres for a park; and <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> to get 4.5 acres for a veterans home. The rest of the land is tied up in road rights-of-way. The money paid by the Colliers would be placed into a trust fund for the education of Indians in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Yates </PERSON> and <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> argued that taxpayers would get a better deal if the property were sold on the open market. They said at least one appraiser has set the value of the <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> land at $ 100 million more than the value attached to it in the proposed exchange. `` This is a sweetheart deal between the <ORGANIZATION> Colliers </ORGANIZATION> and the federal government,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. `` We're being asked to ratify a great deal for the <ORGANIZATION> Colliers </ORGANIZATION> and a terrible deal for <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. taxpayers.'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> argued that while the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> land is environmentally sensitive and a good federal acquisition, it already is protected from any damaging development by federal law. `` This is a cushy, cozy deal for the <ORGANIZATION> Colliers </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Yates </PERSON>. `` If it were not <PERSON> Mo </PERSON> <PERSON> Udall </PERSON>'s bill, it would be laughed off the floor. ... It's a very bad bill.'' The bill would give the <ORGANIZATION> Colliers </ORGANIZATION> three years to decide whether to exercise an option on the <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> property. If they did, other developers would have 90 days to submit bids, which the <ORGANIZATION> Colliers </ORGANIZATION> would be allowed to top. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> and <PERSON> Yates </PERSON> argued that this procedure favors the <ORGANIZATION> Colliers </ORGANIZATION> because competitors would not be able to come up with the development plans and financing within a short time. They tried to convince the House to send the bill back to the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> with instructions to revise it to include an open competitive bidding process. Their recommittal motion lost 279-133. In the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, the Indian Affairs and Energy and Natural Resources committees took testimony on the issue on Monday but have not drafted legislation of their own. The <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> property is in <LOCATION> Collier </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. The bulk of the 108,000 acres lies immediately north of the Big Cypress National Preserve, which borders Everglades National Park on the park's northwest side. Another parcel, of 5,000 acres, is adjacent to the Fakahatchee Strand State Preserve, known home to perhaps a fifth of the 30 to 50 <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> panthers believed left in the wilderness. The state preserve is west of the national preserve. And 19,620 acres is next to the state's <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Romano-Ten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Thousand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> Aquatic Preserve, on the Gulf coast south of <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION> and west of <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> today urged <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s leaders to investigate alleged brutality by authorities who quelled riots in which scores of people died. `` These investigations should lead to the bringing to justice of those responsible for human rights violations,'' the London-based human rights organization said in response to a query by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said it was concerned about allegations of human rights violations of demonstrators and prisoners during unrest in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> this year. In recent months, several minor quarrels have turned into major and bloody anti-government riots. Western and <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> sources say riot police in the bloodiest demonstration, in March, were commanded by <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>, who this week was named president of <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> and head of its sole political party. He replaced <PERSON> Ne </PERSON> <PERSON> Win </PERSON>, who resigned Saturday after 26 years of authoritarian rule. `` They -LRB- riot police -RRB- and other security or law-enforcement personnel have been repeatedly accused of excessive use of force and acts of criminal negligence resulting in unnecessary deaths and injury to as many as 200 protesters and prisoners,'' the organization said in a telex. The government said that 43 people died in March unrest, including 41 who suffocated in a packed police van as they were being driven to prison. Unofficial reports put the death toll at more than 100. <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said steps taken to investigate abuses have so far proved `` inadequate.'' The organization, which investigates human rights abuses around the world and won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1977, said it has repeatedly expressed concern about evidence `` of a consistent pattern of political killing, torture and arbitrary detention'' by <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> security forces operating in ethnic minority areas. The organization said that still limited information available includes evidence that the army and police in <LOCATION> Karen </LOCATION>, Mon, <LOCATION> Kachin </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Shan </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Arakan </LOCATION> states committed `` severe violations of human rights.'' The Burmese government is waging a decades-old war against ethnic minority groups. A number of Western diplomats and Burmese emigre groups fear that the ascension of <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>, who has a long record of ruthless suppression of dissent, will lead to further unrest and tough reprisals by authorities. `` There are reasons for us to be concerned. Where civil disobedience has augured, <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> was on the spot and the result was killing, maiming and prisoners,'' said <PERSON> Ye </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Thu </PERSON>, general secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Restoration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>, in an interview from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> `` We are very concerned that the students will not be able to hold back their frustration, agony and anguish,'' he said. <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> commanded troops who put down student unrests in 1962 and 1974 and was involved in purges of government officials in the mid-1970s.

 A worker who fell off a 60-foot tower into a huge bin of dry cement gasped for air for nearly two hours while firefighters tried to pull him out, authorities said. He died shortly after his rescue. `` This stuff is like talcum powder and quicksand _ the faster you move in it, the more you sink,'' said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>, a division chief with the <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> LaGrand </PERSON>, 34, fell into the 20-foot steel hopper Wednesday.

About a dozen firefighters tried to pull out the 250-pound worker. He sank below the surface several times, then slipped out of sight for the last time.

<HEAD>White House Opposes Abortion Funding for Rape, Incest Victims</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Adds last two grafs with those voting against, and not
voting.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
 Abortion-rights advocates hailed the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s lopsided vote to extend Medicaid funding to abortions for rape and incest victims as a breakthrough, but the plan still faces skepticism in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and hostility from the White House The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s 73-19 vote Wednesday marked the first departure by either chamber from the restrictive abortion policies of the past seven years. Current law, in effect since 1981, limits payments to abortions in which the life of the mother is endangered. Sen. <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON>, R-Conn., sponsor of the expansion, said the vote Wednesday represented `` a clear change'' from recent tradition `` What is terribly important is just to break that chain'' of restrictive regulations, he said. `` It's a first small start.'' The abortion provision was part of a $ 140 billion appropriations bill passed 80-16 Wednesday evening after a day of frenzied votes and shifting tactics on abortion, family planning and AIDS issues. The bill will keep the departments of <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, and Education in business during fiscal 1989 beginning Oct. 1. Its highlights include $ 7.1 billion for employment and training; $ 1.2 billion for AIDS research, treatment, prevention and education, and $ 4.2 billion for tutoring and other services to disadvantaged students. In a June 28 statement, the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> urged the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to strike its Medicaid abortion provision, saying it `` diverges from longstanding policy on this issue. ... The president's senior advisers would recommend that he veto this bill, solely based on the inclusion of this language provision.'' The abortion provision adopted by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is more restrictive than the simple extension <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON> sponsored during the committee process. Federal money would only be available in promptly reported rape or incest cases, and states could retain the existing, more limited eligibility if they so desire. Sen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Exon </PERSON>, D-Neb., sponsor of the modified version, said it reflects `` the middle ground'' on a difficult issue <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON> said it had a better shot at surviving negotiations with <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members, who did not include a Medicaid expansion in their version of the appropriations bill. Asked about the possibility of a veto, <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON> replied, `` Considering everything else that's in the bill and that it's an election year, it could be overridden.'' But <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, legislative director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Right </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> To </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said he was confident the final product would not contain the Medicaid abortion expansion. `` The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> is strongly committed to the current law. So is the president,'' said <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. In any case, he said, his group considers the <PERSON> Exon </PERSON> amendment `` a very good outcome'' because it gives states some leeway and eliminates the possibility of rape claims six months into a pregnancy. There was little controversy over money allocations in the bill, which was drawn up in accordance with the budget framework agreed to last year by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. But there were enough AIDS, abortion and family planning amendments to prolong debate for three days. In a confusing series of events, senators three times rejected attempts by Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> to renew an expiring ban on federal funds for AIDS education materials that promote or encourage homosexuality. Instead they adopted an amendment described by its sponsor, Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif., as a pre-emptive strike against the <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> ban While it bans federal funds for materials that directly promote or encourage homosexuality, at the same time it says the materials must provide accurate information on how to avoid getting and transmitting AIDS. Some senators disavowed their votes last year in favor of the <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> restrictions, saying they wrongly believed the restrictions were toothless. `` It is a fact that effective materials have been shelved and vital proposals have been tabled because of the fear of what this amendment might do,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Nevertheless, after embracing the <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> amendment 61-37, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> later passed another amendment _ this one containing the <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> restrictions as well as a phrase saying federally funded AIDS materials can not `` use words stating that homosexuality is ` normal,' ` natural' or ` healthy.''' The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted 48-45 to kill a <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> amendment banning federal money to school-based clinics that distribute contraceptives or provide abortion counseling or referral services. Later lawmakers by voice vote approved a more limited version of the same amendment, one which dropped the contraceptives section but retained the ban relating to abortion services. School-based clinics are set up by local school boards to provide health services that sometimes include family planning. Some receive Medicaid funds and money from block grants funneled through states. Voting against the abortion proposal were Sens. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Breaux </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-La </LOCATION>., <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif., <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ariz </LOCATION>., <PERSON> Wendell </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, D-Ky., <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON>, D-Ala., <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-La </LOCATION>., <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, D-Mich., <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ariz </LOCATION>., <PERSON> Mitch </PERSON> <PERSON> McConnell </PERSON>, R-Ky., <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON>, R-Ore., <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON>, D-Nev., <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>, D-Mich., <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shelby </PERSON>, D-Ala., <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, D-Wash., <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, D-Del., <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Daschle </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.D. </LOCATION>, Wyche <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON>, D-Ga., <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, D-Vt., <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Symms </PERSON>, R-Idaho and <PERSON> John </PERSON>

<TEXT>
 A town north of <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> was under curfew today after mobs destroyed Moslem-owned tea shops and attacked police with stones and catapults, leaving one person dead and five wounded, sources said. It was not certain whether the violence was related to this week's national leadership changes in which hard-line former army general <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> assumed the positions of president and head of the only political party. Also today, <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> urged <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s leaders to investigate alleged brutality by authorities who quelled riots in which scores of people died. The government said 43 people died in March unrest, including 41 who suffocated in a packed police van as they were being driven to prison. Unofficial reports put the death toll at more than 100. `` These investigations should lead to the bringing to justice of those responsible for human rights violations,'' the London-based human rights organization said in response to a query by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. The government news agency said Wednesday that the curfew was imposed and all demonstrations banned Tuesday in <LOCATION> Myede </LOCATION>, 220 miles north of <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>, after rioters attacked police with catapults and stones. The official <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burma </ORGANIZATION> said police had to shoot to disperse the crowd and order was restored after several hundred rioters destroyed two tea shops and a third building. The mob first set upon the Moslem-owned tea shops and then went on a looting spree, said the sources, speaking on condition of anonymity. The sources believed the incident was a spillover of riots in nearby Prome. Prome has been under martial law since July 22, after six days of mob violence that reportedly started with an argument between a <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> customer and a Moslem tea shop owner. Most Burmese are <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION>. In recent months, several minor quarrels have turned into major and bloody anti-government riots, including one last March in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> in which more than 100 people were reported killed. That riot also began with a tea shop quarrel. Some analysts believe that the outbursts reflect popular resentment of the government and dissatisfaction with deteriorating economic conditions. Tea shops are popular informal gathering places for the <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>, who ruthlessly suppressed dissidents over the last 26 years, on Tuesday became chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Burma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and on Wednesday became the nation's president. Western diplomats said his rise could fan the fires of political protest that have erupted three times since last October, leaving dozens dead, universities closed and student resentment at a boiling point. Leaflets have appeared in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> in recent days urging continued anti-government agitation. In addition to naming <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> president, Wednesday's one-day, emergency session of also elected former deputy prime minister <PERSON> Tun </PERSON> <PERSON> Tin </PERSON> to the post of prime minister. Vice President <PERSON> Aye </PERSON> <PERSON> Ko </PERSON> remained in his post. Defense Minister <PERSON> Kyaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Htin </PERSON> moved to the No. 3 government position as head of the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>. In all, eight of the 22 major government positions were changed. The changes appeared to herald a continuation of the hardline, one-party system begun by strongman Ne Win 26 years ago, although a number of liberal economic reforms were endorsed. Ne Win, 77, said he was retiring, but doubt remains among Western and Burmese analysts over whether he will fade away or remain a behind-the-scenes director of events. <PERSON> Kya </PERSON> <PERSON> Htin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tun </PERSON> <PERSON> Tin </PERSON>, however, both are regarded as relatively liberal on issues of economic reform and dealing with dissent in the country. <PERSON> Kyaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Htin </PERSON> also moved up to a top party post.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> officials have begun regulating harvests of an icy crop: icebergs that are finding their way into Japanese beverages as gourmet ice cubes at about $ 3 a pound. The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> plans to issue permits Friday for <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dimond </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Juneau </LOCATION> to collect ice in southeastern <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dimond </PERSON> contacted state officials to ask whether he needed permits. Later he said he wanted the permits as a way to reinforce, for overseas buyers, the legitimacy of his ice-gathering business, said <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Pekovich </PERSON>, the department's acting land and water manager for southeastern <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. `` He initiated this,'' <PERSON> Pekovich </PERSON> said, adding that a permit `` is to everyone's advantage,'' and anyone else in the ice-collecting business will be expected to get one. The permits are intended to protect wildlife and marine recreation, <PERSON> Pekovich </PERSON> said. Calls to <PERSON> Dimond </PERSON> were not returned. <PERSON> Dimond </PERSON> gathers icebergs with a crane on a 200-foot barge and breaks the ice into chunks for shipment in freezer vans bound for <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> AK-Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> further breaks down the ice, packs it in one-kilogram sacks and ships it to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, where a bag sells for about $ 6.80. In <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, glacial ice is enjoyed for its novelty and durability. It lasts about twice as long as an ice cube from a refrigerator, and has no trace of chlorine or other additives, said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Harper </PERSON>, vice president of AK-Pacific. `` It's a gourmet type of product that complements the <ORGANIZATION> Perrier </ORGANIZATION>, mineral water situation,'' he said. The permits limit <PERSON> Dimond </PERSON>'s proximity to campsites used primarily by kayakers and specify ice-collection hours to prevent harvesting when sightseeing ships are in the area. To protect hauling grounds for seals, he can not collect ice within 10 miles of a glacier. The permits will allow <PERSON> Dimond </PERSON> to collect 1,000 tons a week. <ORGANIZATION> Southeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> officials oppose the harvests. `` This is a new, incompatible, conflicting use of areas set aside for their natural features, their solitude, their pristine nature,'' <PERSON> Bart </PERSON> <PERSON> Koehler </PERSON>, executive director, said Wednesday.

 A former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hostage urged the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> today to consider releasing Iranian assets in exchange for the release of the nine Americans held captive in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` It can be done aboveboard. It can be done legally and openly, and the Americans, I think, would approve of that,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenco </PERSON>, a Roman Catholic priest who was held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> from January 1985 to June 1986. <PERSON> Jenco </PERSON>, interviewed from <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America,'' said, `` I absolutely believe we should listen to the Iranians ...

 An insect that attacks the buds of maple trees has defoliated or stunted one-sixth of <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>'s forests, threatening its $ 15 million-a-year maple syrup industry and its eye-popping foliage, officials say. `` This is serious. This is something we do n't know very much about and this is something we have to learn as much as we can about as fast as possible to prevent a reoccurence,'' Gov. <PERSON> Madeleine </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunin </PERSON> said Wednesday. <PERSON> Kunin </PERSON> said she would seek about $ 200,000 in state and federal funding for a research and management program to combat the insects, called pear thrips. She said the insect has attacked 466,000 acres in every county in <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>. Western <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> have also reported thrips damage, but <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> <PERSON> Motyka </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> director of forests, said <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> has been hit the hardest. The infestation is so severe in some of <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>'s southern counties that experts may recommend that sugarmakers leave some maple trees untapped next year. `` Maple in <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> is the most prominent tree that we have,'' <PERSON> Motyka </PERSON> said. `` It could tremendously affect not just our industry but our very way of life. If you took all the maples away, it would look very different in <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>.'' State officials said they have no estimate of the damage to the timber industry or to tourism. <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>'s brilliant fall foliage draws thousands of tourists. In the past, thrips were only known to attack fruit trees, but in the last decade they have started defoliating trees of the forest. `` I think there is national and international concern that this may be part of the death of some of our forests and that we've got to put all our resources that we have to work,'' <PERSON> Kunin </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kunin </PERSON> said she would ask the state's <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> to allocate $ 93,950 to research the thrips damage. The board includes <PERSON> Kunin </PERSON> and leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> and handles some financial matters while lawmakers are out of session. <PERSON> Kunin </PERSON> said she would also ask for a $ 60,000 federal grant as well as $ 46,500 from other sources.

<HEAD>Diplomats Say Soviets Taken Over Defense of Kabul Airport</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Western diplomats said today that Soviet troops have taken over the defense of the airport in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s capital and are deploying heavy military equipment around it. The diplomats, speaking on the usual condition of anonymity, said several Soviet armored vehicles were deployed around the airport in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. They said these included mechanized infantry combat vehicles _ a smaller version of Western armored personnel carriers but with greater firepower. Afghan guerrilla attacks from the northeast have been particularly heavy, diplomats said. Soviet response has been to deploy armored vehicles to a security post on the eastern edge of the airport, as well as on a small hill overlooking the airport and at the main gates of the international arrival and departure buildings, they said. The diplomats said the airport has been the target of frequent rocket attacks by guerrillas fighting <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s Soviet-backed government. An attack Sunday missed the mark and rockets landed in a residential area, killing 17 people. In late June, a rocket attack destroyed eight Soviet jet fighters at the airport. Soviet troops entered <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979 to back the government in its war with the guerrillas, who are based in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and supported by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. Under terms of an accord signed in April, the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> troops began withdrawing in May and are to be out by February 1989.

 A $ 50,000 gold and wood flute stolen from an art gallery has been returned by a `` fence'' who realized it was `` too hot'' to handle. <PERSON> Emmett </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON>, the artist who made the one-of-a-kind instrument with 21-karat gold keys, springs and mouthpiece, said Wednesday the recovery was `` amazing.'' `` Everything that happened to it has canceled out the evil of that original impulse -LRB- the theft -RRB-,'' Day said. The flute has been played by such musicians as <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Galway </PERSON>, Day said. The flute and other works by Day were stolen July 8 from the Northwest Gallery of Fine Woodworking. No one has been arrested, police said. On Tuesday, `` we got a call from an attorney in <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION> who said ` if your name is <PERSON> Emmett </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON>, this is your lucky day,''' Day said. His wife, <PERSON> Therese </PERSON>, said the thief had sold the art works for $ 3,500 to a dealer in stolen goods `` who read about the theft in the paper and realized he should n't destroy them, and he could n't resell them because they were too hot. The `` fence'' then contacted the lawyer, she said. Except for some small scratches, the flute and other articles `` were not really hurt,'' Ms. Day said.

 Fire today gutted the home of <PERSON> Winnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> and jailed black guerrilla leader <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, and police said it was set by a group of black teen-agers. No one was home when the blaze broke out at about noon, and there were no injuries, police and witnesses said. Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> arrived by car about an hour later but remained in her vehicle and drove to her nearby office without making any statements. The four-room home in the black township of <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> outside <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> was charred, and all the contents were destroyed in the fire, officials said. Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, a social worker and anti-apartheid activist, shared the modest home with her daughter <PERSON> Zindzi </PERSON>, 27, and two grandchildren. The house belonged to <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> before the couple was married 30 years ago. Police Capt. <PERSON> Ruben </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloomberg </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> that a group of black high school students stoned the <LOCATION> Mandela </LOCATION> home, then doused it with gasoline and set it alight. He said he did not know how many youths were involved nor the motive for the attack. No arrests have been made, he said. Teen-age boys known as `` comrades,'' who regularly guard the house, pushed journalists away from Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s office after the fire, and one threatened to burn a photographer's car. The teen-agers blamed the fire on students from a high school in <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>. They refused to say anything more about the incident. Neighbors and black journalists said Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s young supporters were involved in a dispute with a rival group in the <PERSON> Dube </PERSON> section of <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> on Wednesday and that the attack was a response to the quarrel. Attorney <PERSON> Amrichand </PERSON> <PERSON> Soma </PERSON> told reporters gathered in front of a gate blocked by the youths that <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> was contacted by telephone at <LOCATION> Pollsmoor </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prison </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> and had no public comment on the fire. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> is serving a life term for sabotage and plotting the overthrow of the government. <PERSON> Aubrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Mokoena </PERSON>, a friend of the family and head of the <ORGANIZATION> Release </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mandela </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` The community must band together and put an end to this. Anyone who would think of attacking <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s house represents the forces of darkness. It is time for the community to stand up and stamp this out.'' When he arrived at the gate to the office building, <PERSON> Mokoena </PERSON> greeted the `` comrades'' by saying, `` The war is really on now.'' <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, a leader of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the country's main guerrilla group, has been imprisoned for 26 years.

 An <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> man was buried today in a ceremony tinged with remorse over a series of <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> blunders that have killed 17 people since November. The latest victims _ a <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> couple and their 6-year-old son blown up in their car _ were buried later in their hometown of <LOCATION> Hillsborough </LOCATION>, outside <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>. The first of the day's two funerals was that of 33-year-old <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> Davison </PERSON>, shot to death on his doorstep Monday by the <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Volunteer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, an outlawed Protestant group. <PERSON> Davison </PERSON>, whom the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> claimed as one of its own, was widely believed to have been killed in reprisal for the death of contractor <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanna </PERSON>, his wife <PERSON> Maureen </PERSON>, and their son <PERSON> David </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> admitted triggering the bomb that killed the <PERSON> Hannas </PERSON> as they drove across the border from <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> on Saturday after a vacation. It says its intended victim was a <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> Catholic judge, <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>. Police guarded the approaches to <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>'s Catholic Milltown cemetery but kept their distance from the funeral. The ceremony passed peacefully, with none of the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> ceremonials that have sparked clashes with security forces in the past. <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>, second-in-command of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>'s legal political wing, <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION>, delivered the eulogy. `` For the past number of months we have come through very, very bleak conditions. It has been a very, very bad time, when it seems as if everything the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> has touched has turned to tragedy and it has been very, very rough for many people,'' <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> told several hundred mourners standing in the rain. Sending condolences to the <ORGANIZATION> Hannas </ORGANIZATION>' two surviving teen-age children, he said: `` We share in their tragedy. What happened was terrible. It was regrettable. We want to see all deaths end, including the deaths of our enemies in uniform. We want to see peace in this country.'' At the <ORGANIZATION> Hannas </ORGANIZATION>' funeral, <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> McMullan </PERSON> of the Church of <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> pleaded with the killers on both sides of the conflict to `` recognize what this cult of violence is doing to your own moral and spiritual condition.'' Responding to the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>'s condolences, he said: `` The spokesmen who represent the killers have made their excuses and expressed their regret. But the fact is that <PERSON> Robin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Maureen </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanna </PERSON> are dead ... the plotters planned death and death was what ensued.'' <PERSON> Davison </PERSON>'s coffin was draped in the Irish tricolor, and the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement Tuesday night that it had paid its `` final tribute'' by firing a volley of shots over a nationalist mural in <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> west <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>. It was the first <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> funeral since March 19, when <PERSON> Catholics </PERSON> following the cortege of a slain guerrilla attacked two British soldiers who reportedly blundered into the procession. The soldiers were dragged from their car, severely beaten and shot by <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> gunmen. Security forces had stayed away from that funeral at the request of church and political leaders. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> says it is conducting an inquiry into why five recent operations have been botched, starting with a bomb in November that was meant to hit soldiers but killed 11 <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> civilians at a war memorial service in <LOCATION> Enniskillen </LOCATION>. Other blunders have since included a bomb on a schoolbus that injured a dozen teen-agers, a bomb at a <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> swimming pool that killed two Catholics, and the shooting of a <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> woman. In all cases the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> has apologized, saying the intended targets were security forces or judicial personnel. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> Hannas </ORGANIZATION> were victims of a `` wronged description'' of the judge's car. Judge <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, his wife <PERSON> Bridget </PERSON> and daughter <PERSON> Cait </PERSON> were returning from <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> on the same road.

 <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s foreign minister today allayed concerns that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was reneging on its pledge to withdraw the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. `` This impression has just been dispelled,'' <PERSON> Sahabzada </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaqub </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> said after a meeting with Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>. `` Our position and that of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in regard to the withdrawal is no longer divergent.'' The pace of the pullout and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hopes for fair elections in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> were topics for discussion during the foreign minister's visit There are an estimated 115,000 Soviet troops in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Half are supposed to be withdrawn by Aug. 15. Pakistani President <PERSON> Mohamnad </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Haq </PERSON> raised concerns last week that the Soviets were replenishing them with new troops. But <PERSON> Yaqub </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> said `` the Soviets are carrying out the withdrawal.'' Through <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> armed Afghan rebels fighting the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and the pro-Soviet government in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said this week that <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> had sent new assurances that the Soviets would fulfill their commitment in the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accords of last May to withdraw half the troops by Aug. 15. The report that they would be replaced was traced to the Soviet military commander in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, who apparently did not have the backing of his superiors in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> and <PERSON> Yaqub </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> are comparing notes on how to monitor the Soviet withdrawal _ and on <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s future after the troops are gone. One question is whether the rebels then would be able to bring down President <PERSON> Najibullah </PERSON>. Another is the kind of government that would follow. Several of the rebel leaders would like to install a fundamentalist Moslem regime akin to the government in neighboring <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. `` It is extremely important we look beyond <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and continue close cooperation with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the interest of peace and security in the region,'' <PERSON> Yaqub </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has close ties to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, which gave refuge to millions of Afghan refugees besides funneling covert <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support to the rebels. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials are hoping the elections <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> has set for Nov. 16 will be fair, but there is a question how much pressure <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> might try to apply. `` We will stress that elections should be free and fair, but it is not up to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government to prescribe how they should be held,'' said an official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> dismissed his civilian government in May, but did not call for elections within the 90 days prescribed by the Pakistani constitution.

 Interior Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON>, just back from touring fire-scorched <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION>, said today firefighters are now fighting all new outbreaks. But one official said it's still possible that some new fires might be left to burn. `` Yellowstone is not in danger. ... We're not going to let <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> be damaged by this,'' <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America'' program. Fighting all new outbreaks has always been a possibility in the usual `` let it burn'' policy of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, Chief <PERSON> Ranger </PERSON> <PERSON> Walt </PERSON> <PERSON> Dabney </PERSON> said afterward. Both <PERSON> Dabney </PERSON> and the secretary defended the post-1972 policy of fighting only fires that threaten developed areas or that could spread out of the park into timbering operations on adjacent <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> lands. The <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> follow similar policies in their wildnerness areas because fires are important in generating healthy ecosystems. `` The fact is that <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> has about 3 percent currently burning. ... But they've had a sufficient area under their fire-management plan that their policy now is to fight new fires that break out,'' <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dabney </PERSON> said in an interview the secretary was right in his facts, and all recent outbreaks had been attacked with a view of keeping the fires small, but the policy was unchanged _ decisions will be made case by case, and the action taken will depend on where the fire is and what is threatened, how many firefighters are available and how dangerous it would be to commit them. A few firefighters can knock down a small blaze that might be impossible to control if left alone, he noted. Any fire that breaks out in remote areas might well be left alone now, he said. Any fire near the park boundaries probably would be attacked. Crews have begun using flame throwers to start backfires against fires that have so far scorched some 109,000 of the park's 2.2 million acres. The fires had moved to within six miles of Old Faithful and forced the closing of one of the park's main entrances. `` In <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> specifically we're fighting probably six or eight large fire areas right now,'' <PERSON> Dabney </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> flew over some of the damaged forest land Wednesday and voiced confidence afterwards in the policy of allowing remote areas to burn. In his comments today, the <ORGANIZATION> interior </ORGANIZATION> secretary said the flames had gone far enough. `` What they tell me is we've got standing timber that is as dry or drier than kiln-dried lumber. That makes it just take off like crazy when you have a fire,'' he said. `` In these conditions there's very little control we can have over these fires.'' <PERSON> Dabney </PERSON> said the damage could even help naturalists learn more about the forest by providing a close look at how large-scale fires clear old brush for new wildlife habitat. `` What we're looking at probably occurred naturally in the <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> area every 200 to 400 years,'' he said. `` We've never really had the chance to see wildfire on this scale in the Yellowstone ecosystem, so we're going to look at it very closely from a research standpoint and know a lot more specifically about the benefits of what's going on there now.'' About 80 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> is lodgepole pine in a `` fire-dependent ecology,'' he said. Natural fires `` Are very important to keep species diversified. Many wildlife species will leave an area that's too thick and stagnant.'' New trees and a wealth of wildlife-attracting vegetation grow in the open areas created by fires, whose ashes act as a natural fertilizer, he said.

<HEAD>U.S. Discloses Production Sites of Chemical Weapons</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegate to the Conference on Disarmament today declared the location of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' chemical weapons production facilities. Delegate <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedersdorf </PERSON> said he hoped the declaration would `` contribute both to greater confidence and to the negotiation of related provisions'' of a convention banning the production, stockpiling and use of chemical weapons. The <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> conference has been negotiating such a convention for 20 years. This year's summer session began July 7. `` The declaration we are making today is unprecedented,'' <PERSON> Friedersdorf </PERSON> told the 40-nation conference. `` We urge other countries that possess chemical weapons production facilities to declare the locations of their facilities and to outline how the facilities would be destroyed,'' he said. He said no other conference member had provided information on chemical weapons production facilities. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> are the only two members of the conference who have acknowledged possessing chemical weapons. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has said it believes about 15 nations possess such weapons, but it has refused to name them. The production facilities declared by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are <ORGANIZATION> Rocky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arsenal </ORGANIZATION>, in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>; the <ORGANIZATION> Pine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bluff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arsenal </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>; Muscle Shoals in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Newport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ammunition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Depot </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>; and <ORGANIZATION> Aberdeen </ORGANIZATION> Proving Ground in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has declared the amount of its stockpiles, but not their location nor the location of production sites. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> said in December that its chemical weapons stocks total 50,000 tons, but Western experts have estimated that the actual total is much higher. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> also submitted to the conference ideas for ways to destroy chemical weapons under an eventual ban. Delegates have drafted many parts of a chemical weapons ban. The main unresolved issue is how to guard against cheating.

 Crews using flame throwers fought fire with fire as a blaze burned within six miles of Old Faithful, and authorities said arson caused a <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> wildfire that destroyed 22 buildings and forced 1,000 people to flee. Wildfires also chased hundreds of people from their homes in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, while in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> 1,200 firefighters battled wind-fanned blazes that consumed 1.3 million acres, an area larger than <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>. Large fires, many of them kindled in drought conditions aggravated during a hot, dry summer, also blackened regions in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state and <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>. Interior Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> took a helicopter tour Wednesday through thick smoke to view 10,000 charred acres in the southern areas of <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION>, which is suffering its worst forest fire of the century. The blaze has scorched 109,000 of the park's 2.2 million acres. Firefighters with flame throwers and some in helicopters lit backfires in about 1,000 acres of meadow to burn fuel ahead of the fire and direct it away from Old Faithful, the park's most famous attraction, and nearby structures. Even so, the usual hundreds of summer visitors gathered every 75 minutes or so Wednesday to watch the famous geyser erupt into the smoky sky. `` Fantastic,'' said <PERSON> Alain </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. `` We're not afraid of the fires and we're not worried about it. They say fire is part of the forest.'' In <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, firefighters worked around the clock to dig a fire line around a 2,200-acre blaze that burned out of control in heavy woods within two miles of <LOCATION> Rapid </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, and the fire was declared 80 percent contained today. The fire destroyed 22 structures, including seven houses. On Wednesday night, officials thought 2,000 people had evacuated their homes, but they said today their best estimate was that only 1,000 people left their homes. About half of them were allowed to return home today. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Kopp </PERSON>, a fire commander, said Wednesday the blaze was the work of an arsonist. `` Whoever's doing it, they could burn down half of the <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> if they want,'' said <PERSON> Kopp </PERSON>, adding that authorities have been investigating a string of about 50 fires dating to May which they suspect were set by the same person. He said a cigarette with a match inside was used to start the fire that was spotted Tuesday. Such a device would smolder for a time before bursting into flame. `` I'm not sure what we need to do to catch them, but we need to catch them,'' <PERSON> Kopp </PERSON> said. The suspected arsonist has set as many as to eight fires in one day, he said. In <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, a temperature inversion kept winds mercifully light as crews worked to keep a 1,700-acre fire away from about 50 homes in the <ORGANIZATION> Boise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>, 35 miles north of <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION>. `` The fire is pretty active and moving to the southeast,'' said <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> fire information officer. `` We do n't have a big handle on how much it's burned because there's so much smoke. Winds helped <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s largest fire grow to 409,000 acres, said <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman. Most <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> fires were in remote areas and were let alone because they do n't threaten people or property In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, more than 350 firefighters battled a fire fanned by 20 mph winds and temperatures near 90, which raced across the ridge of the <LOCATION> Cascade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> on Wednesday, tripling its size to 3,600 acres within a few hours. Firefighters in northeastern <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, meanwhile, used a rainstorm to contain a 5-day-old, fireworks-caused blaze that charred 1,955 acres in the <ORGANIZATION> Flaming </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gorge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recreation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION>. Firefighters also contained a lightning-sparked wildfire that burned an estimated 3,400 acres of remote terrain in northwestern <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>. About 50 people evacuated because of a 650-acre blaze in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> expected to go home today. About 70 homes were evacuated Wednesday at <LOCATION> Coulterville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, because of a brush fire blamed on a careless smoker. In <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> voiced confidence in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s controversial `` let it burn'' philosophy for wilderness areas in which people, buildings or roads are not endangered. But he said the excessively dry conditions might make a difference. `` The problem is to decide when you have a prescribed burn or when you have a fire you want to fight,'' <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> said. `` In the dry conditions, they're taking the view that any fire that begins they will try to fight it.'' <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Clary </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> assistant superintendent, said park officials largely will follow the existing policy on natural fires.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said today the nation is regaining its `` religious and moral bearings'' but must do more to overcome promiscuity, drug use, pornography and a drifting away from church and family values. `` An overwhelming nine out of 10 Americans pray,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` Audiences for religious books are growing. The modern communications media are being used for evangelism.'' In a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> Student </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Evangelism at the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, the president said his administration `` has worked hard to reflect this return to basic values.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> ticked off a host of steps in recent years, including enactment by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> of the Equal Access Act of 1984, giving voluntary religious groups the right to meet after school on the same basis as other groups. He also cited longstanding administration positions in support of returning prayer to the classroom and reversing the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision that legalized abortions. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> seldom goes to church, but has said he prays frequently. In his speech today, he said that `` I am not going to preach a sermon.'' At another point, the president talked to the young men and women about the pressures teen-agers feel to have sex out of wedlock. `` I'm sure that each of you believes that someday you'll find someone to fall in love with _ and you will,'' he said. `` Sometimes you may get frustrated and, yes, finding the right one may take longer than you thought. `` But do n't worry. It will happen,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` And that's why it's so important for you not to pay any attention at all to those who say that promiscuity is somehow stylish and rewarding No, the right thing to do is to wait for that one special person _ beginning now.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said that `` we must admit that in recent years, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> did seem to lose some of her religious and moral bearings.'' He said pornography spread unchecked and was `` available virtually on every magazine rack in every drugstore or shop in the land.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said drug abuse `` spread through the nation like a fever, attracting children as well as adults and involving drugs that were once unheard of _ drugs like LSD and PCP.'' While the president said those problems remain, `` I believe there's been a change.'' `` Now, although we Americans have done much to put our national life back on the firm foundation of traditional values, there is still a great deal to be done,'' he said. `` And so today, I want to challenge you young people to see that our nation does still more _ still more to return to the life-giving values of faith and family.''

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> launched a seven-state presidential campaign swing today after spending three days tending to his duties as <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor _ including signing off on the final piece of a plan to balance his fiscal 1988 state budget. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> met early today with fund-raisers and with supporters of <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, then headed for <LOCATION> Secaucus </LOCATION> where he was to visit a high-tech office park surrounded by a shopping center. One of the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> supporters, <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Sharpe </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON>, was accompanying him, and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aides said the Democratic presidential nominee would meet later in the campaign trip with others who supported <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s presidential bid. In a speech prepared for delivery in <LOCATION> Secaucus </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> restated the major points of his acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention last week. `` There are some who say we ca n't have a strong economy and create opportunity for all our citizens,'' he said. `` Well, I know from my experience in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> that equal opportunity and economic growth go hand in hand. ... It begins with the recognition that a strong economy needs three things: investment, innovation and teamwork.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> ended his day Wednesday by attending the 30th annual convention of the <ORGANIZATION> Pancretan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, a group of Greek-Americans who trace their roots back to the island of <LOCATION> Crete </LOCATION>. There, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> repeated an Athenian pledge to public service he frequently adds to campaign speeches, and then left the stage to join a Greek dance. After <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was heading to <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> and then to <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> on Friday and <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> on Saturday. The Democratic nominee resumed stumping a day after a poll was released showing him with an 18-point lead over Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the largest margin of the campaign and an sign of the boost <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> received from last week's Democratic National Convention. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> drew 50 percent support to 32 percent for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> national survey of 1,770 registered voters. He had led by 10 points, 46-36, in a pre-convention NBC-Journal poll. The latest poll, conducted by telephone Saturday through Monday, had a margin of error of three points. Before leaving the Statehouse, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> signed a number of bills passed by the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> before it broke for a summer recess. Among them was a $ 124 million spending plan to close the books on the fiscal year that ended June 30. The money was largely for underfunded entitlement programs such as Medicaid and Aid to Families with Dependent Children. Also signed into law by the governor was legislation to help ease prison overcrowding through the purchase of modular units containing 1,000 beds and a measure restoring a child-pornography law struck down by the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. He also announced distribution of $ 7.8 million in state and federal grants for victim assistance programs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> dismissed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s repeated criticism of a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> furlough program that, until it was amended, allowed passes to first-degree murderers, including a man who escaped from a furlough and raped a <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> woman. `` I've got a record,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, referring to statistics showing his state's crime rate had dropped 13 percent in the past four years. `` I do n't know what the vice president's record is.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was to spend the first half of next week at the <ORGANIZATION> Statehouse </ORGANIZATION> before taking a Western campaign swing, during which aides said he planned to interview several <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> backers interested in joining the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> fall effort. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> himself should resume campaigning `` very shortly,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' general election coordinator and campaign secretary. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also plans to campaign during the Republican National Convention next month, although no itinerary was available. `` We do not plan any fishing or hunting trips during that period,'' said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Estrich </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' campaign manager, referring to a fishing trip <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> took with <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> during the first few days of the Democratic convention. `` We plan to campaign.''

 A judge reminisced about the candy stores of his youth, then sentenced a man convicted of murdering a candy store owner to life in prison.

 Government critics on Thursday hailed political leaders for nominating an elected official as prime minister, but the nominee said <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>'s many factions will make <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> difficult to govern. <PERSON> Chatichai </PERSON> <PERSON> Choonhavan </PERSON>, a conservative former army general and millionaire, formally announced his nomination as prime minister Thursday. <PERSON> Chatichai </PERSON>, 66, a member of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and an acting deputy prime minister, reluctantly accepted the nomination Wednesday after <PERSON> Prem </PERSON> <PERSON> Tinsulanonda </PERSON> refused another term for unspecified personal reasons. <PERSON> Prem </PERSON> has served for eight years. `` The five political parties that will form the coalition government have agreed to support the leader of the largest party, and as that party's leader, I am pleased to accept the nomination,'' <PERSON> Chatichai </PERSON> told reporters Thursday. However, before he accepted the nomination to a four-year term as prime minister, <PERSON> Chatichai </PERSON> said on Wednesday: `` If I were prime minster, I'm afraid it -LRB- the government -RRB- wo n't last more than three months.'' <PERSON> Chatichai </PERSON> was nominated by the leaders of five political parties that hastily formed a coalition headed by <PERSON> Prem </PERSON> after no single party won a plurality in Sunday's parliamentary election. <PERSON> Prem </PERSON>, a 67-year-old former army commander, called the elections 24 months early after dissolving <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, disbanding his faction-ridden coalition government and nullifying a no-confidence motion from the opposition. <ORGANIZATION> Chatichai </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> received the most votes in Sunday's general election. The other four parties in the coalition are the <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Rassadorn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Although <PERSON> Chatichai </PERSON>'s party and the coalition partners hold 215 of the 357 seats in the lower house of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, more lobbying may take place before his name is submitted for approval to constitutional monarch <PERSON> Bhumibol </PERSON> <PERSON> Adulyadej </PERSON>. In the past, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>'s powerful military and senior bureaucrats also were said to have been involved in the final choice of the country's leader. Under Thai law, after elections the major parties select a prime ministerial candidate, who does not have to be a member of Parliament. Prem, for instance, does not hold an elective office. The coalition that backed <PERSON> Prem </PERSON>'s last government, virtually the same one that nominated <PERSON> Chatichai </PERSON>, was plagued by many divisions. Before his nomination, <PERSON> Chatichai </PERSON> also was not widely regarded as a likely choice and has not enjoyed close ties with the powerful military, as <PERSON> Prem </PERSON> did. However, <PERSON> Chatichai </PERSON> said Thursday he met with the army chief, Gen. <PERSON> Chavalit </PERSON> <PERSON> Yongchaiyudh </PERSON>, and `` got military support'' for his nomination. <PERSON> Chatichai </PERSON>'s nomination was welcomed by students and other government critics because he, unlike <PERSON> Prem </PERSON>, was an elected official. After the nomination the students said they would end protests they held before the nomination. `` Chatichai represents the people who voted him into the government and we respect that,'' student leader <PERSON> Mana </PERSON> <PERSON> Treelayatewat </PERSON> said Thursday. Mana, a leader of the 100,000-member Students Federation of <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, said: ` This is the first time in 10 years that democracy can be developed and mature in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>. We have reached our goal: premiership from direct elections.'' <PERSON> Chatichai </PERSON> is a retired army major general and wealthy businessman who has held the foreign affairs and industry portfolios in earlier governments. Commissioned as an army officer in 1940, <PERSON> Chatichai </PERSON> served in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>'s brief war in <LOCATION> Indochina </LOCATION> in 1940-41, in World War II and in the Korean War to which <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> sent troops to fight with the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> command. He also served as ambassador to <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>. If <PERSON> Chatichai </PERSON> succeeds <PERSON> Prem </PERSON>, he is expected to follow a conservative, pro-Western policy and emphasize economic development.

 A man robbed a family of tourists of their video camera as they filmed <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON>'s Cathedral, then tried to get away in an off-duty jail guard's car but was shot to death on a nearby crowded street, police said. The holdup occurred at evening rush hour Wednesday on fashionable Fifth Avenue, ending when the correction officer fired his gun inside his car, striking the robbery suspect three times in the chest, said a police spokesman, Sgt. <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>. <PERSON> Angel </PERSON> <PERSON> Santiago </PERSON>, 22, died later in the afternoon at <LOCATION> Bellevue </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said. A second suspect, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, 19, turned himself in this morning and was charged with robbery and attempted robbery, police said. The officer, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonilla </PERSON>, 33, also shot himself in the foot during the struggle and was in stable condition at <LOCATION> Bellevue </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said. The thief's body slumped over <PERSON> Bonilla </PERSON>'s 5-year-old son in the front seat of the car, but the boy was uninjured, police said. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashcraft </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Muncie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, said he was standing across the avenue from <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON>'s Cathedral with his family at about 5 p.m., his video camera trained on the landmark church. Despite the midtown crowds, two men pulled up in a car, one got out and demanded <PERSON> Ashcraft </PERSON>'s camera, he said. `` He said if you do n't give me your camera and take it over and put it in that car right now I'm going to shoot you,'' said <PERSON> Ashcraft </PERSON>. `` At that point I did n't believe he had a gun. `` But then he pulled the gun and when he pulled the gun I gave him the camera,'' <PERSON> Ashcraft </PERSON> said. As the robbers tried to speed off, police said, their car collided with a taxi and then slammed into the side of a bus. The pair then jumped out of their car and fled. One suspect, <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>, ran onto a nearby street and tried to escape by scrambling into <PERSON> Bonilla </PERSON>'s car through an open window before he was shot, said a police spokesman, Sgt. <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>. Police believe <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> was the thief who grabbed <PERSON> Ashcraft </PERSON>'s camera. The gun used by <PERSON> Bonilla </PERSON> was his personal revolver, which he was authorized the carry, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said. Police said <PERSON> Ashcraft </PERSON> recovered his video camera from the robbery suspects' car, which they had left behind when they fled.

 It was a sweet decision indeed that will enable two British cake decorators to show their talents their own way at a convention here. <PERSON> June </PERSON> <PERSON> Melendy </PERSON> on Wednesday picked up an 88-pound box of specially milled powdered sugar and other supplies from federal officials. `` It's in the back of my car and I'm not going to let it out of my sight,'' she said.

<TEXT>
 Sexy luxury at <ORGANIZATION> Givenchy </ORGANIZATION> and casual luxury at Per Spook were the keynotes of fashion Thursday, winding up the couture showings for winter. Following Spook's show, a committee of 24 international fashion writers awarded this season's Golden Thimble prize for all-around excellence to Dior's couturier, <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Bohan </PERSON>. Many of the designers came to the Palais Galliera fashion museum with a few models wearing their designs, to participate in the Golden Thimble ceremonies. `` Dior's mink-trimmed taupe suits actually made me jealous,'' said couturier <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Feraud </PERSON>, a top-rated designer himself. `` They were perfectly cut and made.'' <PERSON> Givenchy </PERSON>'s suits shown in the morning were also perfectly tailored, with nipped waists, most narrow skirts short to an inch or two above the knee. <PERSON> Givenchy </PERSON> has been an advocate of short skirts, but also showed some longer lengths. There were bursts of color, even in the fabulous furs that went with the dresses and suits. <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>, mink and sable were dyed ruby, violet, pastel blue and yellow to go with outfits in different dazzling tones. Cloth coats were usually luxurious cashmere, of course. One model looked great in lavender with a dark purple windowpane plaid. Bicolored suede and satin outfits were other appealing highlights _ royal blue or amethyst with a rust belt and toque, for instance. There were a few pants for daytime or evening, more often than not dressed up with neat matador boleros and Spanish grandee hats. <PERSON> Givenchy </PERSON>'s late-day wear was more siren-bright than usual, though a few black beaded and sequined numbers cropped up. More frequent were the satin dresses with sashes in tones like pink and raspberry or emerald and magenta. Feathers, beehive-ruffled sleeves, black velvet appliques on bicolored stretch jersey dresses added up to coquettish looks. <PERSON> Givenchy </PERSON> lenghthened a few hemlines to mid-calf, though the dressy strapless-topped models were usually clinging to the torso, flared below the knee. <PERSON> Givenchy </PERSON>'s funny hats were remarkable, too. Besides boaters, there were ripple or wave shapes, lace-edged tiny cones or jigsaw-puzzle shapes, big fur rims on wide-brimmed hats. Ball gowns were sumptuous as always, whether slim and with plunging decolletes or strapless with full taffeta skirts, some with an iridescent effect. Per Spook chose some short styles _ minis and full shorts, even though they were for the fall _ or much longer skirts and pants. As usual, the Norwegian-born designer presented color-coordinated groups of clothes from day to evening, all walking out at once, an appealing way of showing a modestly winning collection. Combinations of champagne and ivory, royal blue and gray, raspberry and green and sunny yellow and brown were lively rather than loud. A soft mohair boxy coat topped a full chocolate brown cashmere skirt, the smocked silk crepe blouse echoing the tones of the outfit. There was plenty of luxury in this charming collection that featured details such as sequined bodices over full leather skirts, fitted and piped tweed military jackets, double-flounced clinging suede dresses, excellent flannel pants with embroidered bolero jackets, intricate seaming on bodices and hems of evening dresses. Spook's strapless ballerina-length gowns and the tiered silk dresses in white and pink ribbons looked great for young debs or sweethearts of Sigma Chi. These final adorable dresses were appropriately called `` La Vie en Rose.''

<HEAD>Prices Soar In China For Brand Name Cigarettes, Spirits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN POMFRET</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government raised the base prices of its best cigarettes and liquors Thursday in an effort to break up a thriving black market, and it allowed state-run stores to set the retail prices for the first time. Store managers said that on Friday they will raise the prices even higher. The cost of a pack of a popular brand of cigarettes went up nearly 400 percent, and the price of a fifth of a bottle of spirits shot up 750 percent. But consumers were used to paying at least that much anyway. The black market holds a virtual monopoly on top-quality cigarettes and liquor in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Private sellers bribe store managers to sell them the goods wholesale and then resell them to the public at inflated prices. On Thursday, brand-name cigarettes and liquors surfaced in stores for the first time in about 15 years. Business was brisk. At the Xidan Market in west <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, manager <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> <PERSON> Dajiang </PERSON> said he sold 1,500 cartons of cigarettes in two hours during the morning. `` We could have sold more, but we're saving them for tomorrow to see what price they'll fetch,'' he said. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the world's largest producer and consumer of tobacco, has 300 million smokers. Across town at the <LOCATION> Guandong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Market </LOCATION>, manager <PERSON> Zhen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ciping </PERSON> said wines and cigarettes had been selling fast. `` Today we're experimenting, seeing which brands the masses like,'' she said. `` Tomorrow we'll raise the prices of the popular ones.'' Customers complained the prices were too high, but they bought anyway. `` The prices are the same as you can get from the private sellers and that's too high,'' said customer <PERSON> Zhang </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhiping </PERSON>, holding four cartons of popular <PERSON> Zhonghua </PERSON> cigarettes at the Xidan Market. The cigarettes went up almost 400 percent from 49 cents to $ 1.90 a pack. Thursday's price increases mainly affected 13 name-brand cigarettes and 13 famous-brand spirits, although the costs of some B-grade items also jumped. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is experiencing its highest inflation since 1949. Consumer prices last month were 19 percent higher than in June 1987. Last year, the previous high, inflation hit 7.2 percent. In May, the government raised the prices of vegetables, pork, sugar and eggs as part of a far-reaching economic reform program to end state controls of prices. Economists hope to increase production and raise the standard of living. In announcing the increases Monday, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, or Cabinet, said it would let the price of the 26 brands be determined by the market. Managers in state-run stores said that meant they could set prices and reap a profit from their sales, something unheard of a few years ago. According to the managers, the government set a base price. If a store is able to sell the items for more, it can keep the difference. At <LOCATION> Guandong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Market </LOCATION>, manager <PERSON> Zhen </PERSON> said she planned to let the workers share the profit. At <LOCATION> Xidan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> said it would be invested in the store. Managers said Thursday they would have no problem selling some items for a profit. `` We're not even selling <LOCATION> Maotai </LOCATION> yet,'' Ms. <PERSON> Zhen </PERSON> said, referring to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s popular sorghum liquor whose base price rose 750 percent Thursday from $ 5.40 to $ 40.50 for a fifth of a gallon. `` We're waiting to see what the market will bear. But several problems were immediately apparent with the government's plan to price the profiteers out of business. Only a few stores had the name-brand goods, and they had enough for just a few days. Also, prices in the state-run stores still were generally below those of the black market. Store managers said they expected profiteers to continue to buy large quantities of cigarettes and liquor at the state-run stores. `` Then they'll turn around and make a profit on our goods once we run out,'' a shop manager said. `` This problem wo n't be solved in a flash.''

<HEAD>Office Writes Bogus Tickets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A city patrolman with a heart says he has been writing one or two bogus traffic tickets a week in the names of non-existent motorists for about 18 months. `` I just could not bring myself to write tickets,'' said Patrolman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghrist </PERSON>. `` I started seeing the human beings behind the drivers' wheels.'' <PERSON> Ghrist </PERSON>, 36, a 17-year veteran, has been suspended for 25 days. Police Chief <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON> concluded that <PERSON> Ghrist </PERSON> wrote fictitious tickets to maintain `` high enforcement statistics.'' Chief Jefferson District Judge <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Smalley </PERSON> said this week that a computer listing of all the tickets <PERSON> Ghrist </PERSON> has written since 1981 shows that more than 1,000 are in the names of people for whom state transportation employees could not find <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> driver's licenses `` We have to assume that almost all of them are fictitious,'' <PERSON> Smalley </PERSON> said. However, the official letter from <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON> to Safety Director <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuster </PERSON> recommending <PERSON> Ghrist </PERSON>'s suspension says only what <PERSON> Ghrist </PERSON> has admitted _ that he wrote one or two phony tickets per week over a year and a half. <PERSON> Kuster </PERSON> said Wednesday that he was unaware that more than 1,000 questionable tickets had been written. And Lt. Col. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Aubrey </PERSON> said the police internal affairs unit's investigation of <PERSON> Ghrist </PERSON> would be reopened because of that information Each person who gets a traffic ticket is sent a letter by <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> notifying him of his court date. If the person fails to show up, a second letter is sent. If two court appearances are missed, the court sends the ticket to the state <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION>. That agency sends the ticketed driver a letter warning he will lose his license if the ticket is n't resolved within 20 days, said cabinet spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> McDaniel </PERSON>. This year, for the first time, the cabinet began sending tickets that do n't match driver's licenses back to <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Smalley </PERSON> said. In a batch of about 50 returned by the state in March, clerks discovered that <PERSON> Ghrist </PERSON> had written 29, police Maj. <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Rausch </PERSON> then asked them to do a more extensive check, <PERSON> Smalley </PERSON> said. Checking tickets that <PERSON> Ghrist </PERSON> wrote since 1981 for people whose names began with the letters A through C, the clerks found about 250 for which the state had been unable to locate drivers' licenses, <PERSON> Smalley </PERSON> said He said the clerks made another check of tickets that <PERSON> Ghrist </PERSON> had written that were never resolved and found 1,050. <PERSON> Ghrist </PERSON> said he admitted writing the fictitious tickets when called to <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON>'s office a few weeks ago. He said he also wrote legitimate tickets. In his letter, <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON> said he considered recommending that <PERSON> Ghrist </PERSON> be fired, but decided to be more lenient because <PERSON> Ghrist </PERSON> was not motivated by greed. For example, he did not receive special pay given to officers for court appearances. `` Rather, Officer <PERSON> Ghrist </PERSON> seems to have been motivated by a self-imposed peer pressure to maintain high enforcement statistics,'' <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON> wrote. Assistant City Law Director <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Guagliardo </PERSON> said <PERSON> Ghrist </PERSON> may have violated state law. However, <PERSON> Guagliardo </PERSON> said he never determined which statute <PERSON> Ghrist </PERSON> could have violated because <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> officials told <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON> they did n't wish to prosecute. Since January, <PERSON> Ghrist </PERSON> has been assigned to drive a vehicle that cruises expressways to help stranded motorists.

<TEXT>
 In the dusty days of summer, when temperatures hover above 100 degrees for days on end, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> rejoices at the coming of the monsoon and its cooling rains. `` In the West, the rains are depressing. In <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> they are a time of great joy, release, beauty and romance,'' says <PERSON> Khushwant </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, a noted author and journalist. As the rains come, the dust settles. Parched gardens suddenly turn green. Temperatures come soothingly down and so do tempers. But the monsoon has its sad side. The rains that started early in July ended two years of drought in northern <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, promising good crops at last, but they also unleashed floods that three weeks later had left at least 370 people dead around the country of drowning or disease spread by contaminated water. The death toll in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> from contaminated water approached 100. A city official said more than 7,100 others had been treated in hospitals for cholera or gastroenteritis. For <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>, the downpour broke the stifling heat, but telephones went dead, potholes multiplied or grew deeper, and disease became a danger as tainted water seeped into pipes and wells. At the first delicious moment of the monsoon, though, the nourishing rain kept such troubles distant. `` The monsoon ... for most Indians ... is not only the source of life, but also their most exciting contact with nature,'' says author-journalist <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>. When the clouds first burst open over <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>, dozens of half-naked children danced gleefully in the downpour and splashed in puddles in one impoverished neighborhood along the <LOCATION> Yamuna </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. `` It's always like this,'' said <PERSON> Gulab </PERSON>, an elderly woman watching the fun. `` The children love to play in the rain, but they invariably get sick.'' More than 5,300 people have been treated this year for gastro-enteritis and cholera in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>. At least 182 have died, most of them children. <PERSON> Maya </PERSON> <PERSON> Rao </PERSON>, a university teacher who has lived in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> for many years, described <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>'s monsoon this way: `` There is muck and mud all over, mosquitoes attack you in hordes, diseases spread like vice. It's impossible to get to places on time, given the state of the roads, and calling people on the phone is such a nuisance _ half the phones are dead.'' Then, she added, there's the humidity. `` The moment the rain stops, you sweat to death.'' Even so, Ms. <PERSON> Rao </PERSON> went on, she ca n't imagine life without the monsoon. `` What could be more delightful than eating ` bhutta' -LRB- roasted corn-on-the-cob -RRB- on your terrace as the grey-purple skies melt into rain?'' One city official, who insisted on anonymity, said he could do no work during the monsoon. `` It's too beautiful just to relax, sit and watch the rain,'' he said, as he sat watching the rain stream down his office window.

<HEAD>Government May Sell Vanity License Plates</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government has announced a new scheme to help finance its car licensing department _ the sale of vanity plates. The hottest item, says <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Channon </PERSON>, may be D1 ANA, which would appeal to fans of Princess <PERSON> Diana </PERSON>, wife of the heir to the throne. Other likely attractions are DAV 1D, F1 RST, CHR 1S, F111 JET, and F1 DEL. Because such plates must have at least one digit, zeroes pass for the letter O, 1 for I and 5 for <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Channon </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday the plates will go on auction in an effort to cut $ 1.7 million per year from vehicle registration costs. Unlike American motorists, who for a fee can order the license plate lettering of their choice, British drivers now depend on the computer to churn out lucky combinations of letters and digits. Some of the plates slip through the system, however, and 70,000 change hands each year, some fetching thousands of dollars. Private dealers advertise the so-called `` cherished'' plates in newspapers and auto magazines.

<TEXT>
 The chairman and senior Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> today accused the White House of trying to `` set up'' <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to make it appear a news leak about a covert action plan for <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> began on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. In fact, said Sens. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Boren </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Maine </LOCATION>, they were receiving inquiries from reporters on Tuesday even before the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> briefing on the plan got under way `` I think the matter was handled in such a way as to set up members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to make them appear the source of the leak,'' said <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>. `` I am offended by it.'' <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said he suspected the tactic may have been designed to damage chances for legislation opposed by the administration to require notification of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> intelligence committees within 48 hours of any covert action plan signed by the president. The bill stemmed from last year's Iran-Contra investigation and is designed to tighten current law, which requires only that unspecified `` timely notice'' be given to congressional overseers. <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> said he also believed the leak could have been designed to give the appearance that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration is doing something about the situation in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, which has become a political liability for <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential candidate <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Both Sen. <PERSON> Alfonse </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, and Rep. <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON>, D-Colo., suggested Wednesday that the administration may have leaked the purported plan to the news media to create the illusion of a stepped-up campaign against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> The reported plan was first disclosed by the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, but neither newspaper provided details. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and administration spokesmen were uniformly silent Wednesday when asked about it by reporters. Informed comment about the alleged plan was scarce, and even <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> and <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON> admitted their remarks were speculative because they had not received an official briefing. Published and broadcast reports said the activities fall short of a paramilitary operation, such as kidnaping <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to bring him to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, where he faces drug charges. <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> suggested that news leak came from the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> `` during this political season'' to create the impression that the administration is doing something about <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and drug trafficking in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON> also said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> authorized the activity to give the appearance of stepping up the campaign against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. `` It's politically motivated,'' she said. Ambassador <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON>, who broke with the Noriega-led government in February, said in an interview he is pleased that the administration has maintained a no-negotiations policy toward <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> since the collapse of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bid in May to encourage him to surrender power. But <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON>, who shares the administration view that ousted <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> is the legitimate leader in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, said he had not been briefed on the reported covert action plan. This contradicted a source quoted in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON> also said he doubted widespread reports that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had informed <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> of the plan during a telephone conversation on July 15. `` As far as I know, the conversation did not touch on that,'' said <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON>, who continues to serve at <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s embassy here in defiance of the Panamanian government's efforts to appoint its own envoy. The administration has frozen Panamanian government assets in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as part of broad policy of economic denial against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. At one point, the administration was considering dropping the drug charges against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> if he would leave <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, but talks with the military strongman broke down in May. The administration then withdrew its proposals and said it would not take part in further negotiations. Offers by Guatemalan President <PERSON> Vinicio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cerezo </PERSON> and former Venezuelan President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> to start up an alternate negotiating process have not borne fruit. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has refused to discuss <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s political future since the collapse of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> initiative. The administration had hoped to negotiate <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s surrender of power by Aug. 12, the fifth anniversary of his ascension as commander of the Defense Forces. Asked what he expects <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to do on that day, <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON> said the Panamanian leader will either do nothing or he will step down and announce his candidacy for presidential elections set for next May. Any such elections, <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON> said, `` obviously will be a farce'' if they are under <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s control.

 Local residents donated $ 3,600 to four British dancers who could not afford to fly home because they were underpaid by a nightclub, their lawyer's office said Thursday. <PERSON> Keiji </PERSON> <PERSON> Shishioka </PERSON> of the Muramatsu-Hijii law office identified the dancers as <PERSON> Colette </PERSON> <PERSON> Zacca </PERSON> of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> Allegaert </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Essex </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Dawn </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheridan </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> of the Isle of <PERSON> Wight </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dawn </PERSON> <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Leach </PERSON> of Kent. <PERSON> Shishioka </PERSON> said the women began working in April at a nightclub in <LOCATION> Sapporo </LOCATION>, northern <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> under a contract stipulating each would receive $ 1,000 a month plus room and board and their flight expenses to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. But each received only $ 150 after working for about two months, he said. <PERSON> Shishioka </PERSON> said a court ruled June 23 the club must give the women their back wages but the dancers were unable to collect from the nightclub. The women received the donations from residents who read newspaper accounts about their troubles. The dancers will leave for home on Saturday.

<HEAD>New ``Ring Cycle'' Production Receives Praises and Boos</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BAYREUTH, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The audience cheered the singers and musicians but booed the director after the premier of a modernistic version of <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON>'s `` Ring Cycle'' that opened the <ORGANIZATION> Bayreuth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wagner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Festival </ORGANIZATION>. After the performance Wednesday night, an international cast of singers and musicians under the direction of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> Orchestra conductor <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Barenboim </PERSON> received enthusiastic applause. For the first time this year, the orchestra includes 11 musicians from communist <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. But East German director <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kupfer </PERSON>, who attempted to turn the old German myths into a symbolic depiction of the modern world, drew boos. <PERSON> Kupfer </PERSON>, according to the Hamburg-based weekly <ORGANIZATION> Stern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION>, is seeking to present the Wagnerian tragedies as a portrayal of present times by showing `` aspects of our threatened world.'' `` The audience should learn something,'' the magazine quoted <PERSON> Kupfer </PERSON> as saying. `` They must not just close their eyes and enjoy the beautiful music. They should reflect on the meaning.'' <PERSON> Kupfer </PERSON> set his production in modern times and on a modern street, which he says is `` part of the traveled road in human history.'' Stage settings are built of bits and pieces of ordinary, every-day materials. A dragon's cave, where the stolen <LOCATION> Rhine </LOCATION> gold is stashed, is made from an old piece of sewer piping. <LOCATION> Valhalla </LOCATION>, the home of the gods, is presented as a cube of neon lights, suspended above a smoke-covered stage floor. The gods travel to and from their <LOCATION> Valhalla </LOCATION> home in a rainbow-colored, glass-enclosed elevator. Modern social themes were also woven into <PERSON> Kopfer </PERSON>'s presentation. The three goddesses of fate are portrayed as Bedouin gypsy women, weaving their threads of fortune from 42 television antennas. <PERSON> Kupfer </PERSON> said the use of trenchcoats and other types of overcoats for costumes is intended to depict `` the cold discomfort of the homeless.'' The opening performance marked the 600th presentation of the `` Ring Cycle'' at the <LOCATION> Bayreuth </LOCATION> festival, and the second attempt at bringing the Wagnerian tragedies into a modern setting. In 1976, French director <PERSON> Patrice </PERSON> <PERSON> Chereau </PERSON> directed a production of the opera set in the 19th century, which, like <PERSON> Kupfer </PERSON>'s offering, was booed by the audience and received negative reviews <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON>'s `` Ring Cycle'' will be performed three times at this year's festival, which ends August 29. Tickets for all of the festival performances have been sold out since November.

<TEXT>
 Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said today the guessing game about his vice presidential running mate is inevitable and he hopes it wo n't demean anyone involved Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, speaking on ethics, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> should have been calling for <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s resignation since last spring <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, in a speech in <LOCATION> Secaucus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, also referred in dismissive fashion to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s statement Tuesday that he would create a White House ethics office headed by a senior counselor. `` In a <ORGANIZATION> Dukakis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the ethics office will be in the Oval Office, not someplace down the hall,'' the Democratic presidential nominee said. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> has announced his resignation and said he will soon leave his post as attorney general, but <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the Republican vice president, should have been demanding <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s ouster last April after top <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials resigned. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has begun sending out questionnaires seeking background information from potential running mates, including former rival <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>. The vice president, in comments to reporters outside his White House office today, named no names. He said, `` The process is going along in an orderly fashion. ... Hopefully, it wo n't be demeaning to anyone.'' As for the growing list of Republicans believed to be among potential candidates, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` You ca n't avoid speculation.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, at mid-morning and was to visit a day care center in <LOCATION> Secaucus </LOCATION> later in the day before heading for <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>. He will return to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> Saturday night after visiting seven states. Before leaving the Statehouse on Wednesday, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> continued his duties as <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor by signing a number of bills, including crime legislation and the final piece of a plan to balance the 1988 budget. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> dismissed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s repeated criticism of a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> furlough program that allowed passes to first-degree murderers. The program was later amended, but not until after one of the prisoners escaped from a furlough and raped a <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> woman. `` I've got a record,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, referring to statistics showing his state's crime rate had dropped 13 percent in the past four years. `` I do n't know what the vice president's record is.'' He was riding a post-convention wave of enthusiasm, with the latest <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> poll giving him an 18-point lead over <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Running mate <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> after telling a business women's group in <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, that `` the gender gap ... was n't created by accident.'' He told the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> and Professional Women, which <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had addressed Sunday, that the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> record on the Equal Rights Amendment, equal pay and other issues pushed women into the Democratic camp. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the certain nominee at the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> Aug. 15, remained in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> while more feelers went out for prospective running mates. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> congressman, and Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> were among those receiving requests for background information, Republican sources said. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Marci </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said the congressman met with <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kimmitt </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> attorney who is helping screen possible running mates, and would provide the material to the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign within a week. New Hampshire Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> has said he received a questionnaire from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign officials. In addition to <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, the names mentioned most frequently in the speculation include <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republican Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON>. Several women's names also crop up, including Sen. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kassebaum </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>, a former secretary of transportation. Aides to Sen. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON>, former <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Lamar </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>, Rep. <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, Sens. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> and Illinois Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> all said they had not received questionnaires. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, meanwhile, met briefly with <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> to discuss <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s role in campaigning for the party's presidential and local candidates. Neither side would give details on what was discussed. The former presidential candidate said late Wednesday he has been trying to meet with the foreign minister of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in an attempt to discuss the possible release of <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION> being held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` No meetings have been set, but I have been making appeals, through diplomats, to set up a meeting,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from his <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> home. Today, however, he said, in an interview that `` no meeting has been set, and no meeting has been sought.'' In an interview published today in <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said of a possible <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> role as an unofficial envoy, `` It should n't happen We're talking about very sensitive foreign policy. The administration is empowered to conduct those negotiations at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. We do n't need any loose cannons rolling around the deck.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s reaction: `` My moral appeals and humanitarian pleas to gain the release of American hostages is a consistent one. In some sense I have never stopped trying to get hostages free, and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has never started.'' `` We should not lower the dignity of this effort to gain the freedom of Americans held hostage with name calling,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> added when asked about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s comments. `` If he wants to operate in that level, that's his judgment.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has said he will campaign for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, but details have not yet been worked out. Surveys have been suggesting <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> got a boost following last week's convention. In the latest poll _ a telephone survey of 1,770 registered voters conducted Saturday through Monday _ <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> received 50 percent support to 32 percent for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had led by 10 points, 46-36, in a pre-convention NBC-Journal poll. The survey had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.

 An undercover drug agent said today that one of the federal government's most significant cocaine investigations ended prematurely when word of the operation appeared in the news media days after the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> said it would leak the material to expose Nicaraguan government drug smuggling. Appearing behind a screen to conceal his identity, <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON> said the 1984 leak ended `` one of the most significant cocaine investigations in <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> history,'' which he said could have led to the arrest of the entire leadership of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s cocaine cartel. The cartel was operating inside <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> at the time, <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON> said. The hearing was the first in a series by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on crime into whether <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration officials condoned drug smuggling and other criminal activities to further its <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> policy _ especially winning aid for the Contra rebels. The panel also is studying whether administration officials obstructed law enforcement operations, as may have occurred in the 1984 operation. <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON> told the subcommittee that convicted drug pilot <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Seal </PERSON> was working for the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> in the sting operation. The agent described Seal's extensive contact with the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> cartel and with <PERSON> Federico </PERSON> <PERSON> Vaughn </PERSON>, identified by <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON> as an official of the Nicaraguan <ORGANIZATION> interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> ministry </ORGANIZATION>. According to <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> placed cameras in an airplane that Seal flew to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> in 1984 to film the loading of cocaine at a military airstrip. He said the pictures had been developed at <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> headquarters near <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and then `` taken to the White House.'' `` The <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> wanted to release them to the press, to show the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> were dealing in cocaine,'' <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON> said. The agent said <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> officials initially convinced the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> to change its mind, but shortly afterwards, a story on the operation appeared in The <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Times. He said that story ended the operation, and the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> frantically began to make all the arrests possible at that point. The subcommittee chairman, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, said the motive of the planned leak on the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> appeared designed to influence <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to approve aid to the Contras. <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> said a <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> witness was invited to testify on the agency's role in the operation, but he notified the committee he would refuse to cooperate on Fifth Amendment grounds of self-incrimination More than 100 subpoenas have been issued for witness testimony and the production of documents, <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> said. Judicial grants of immunity have been obtained to compel testimony of six persons who refused to cooperate, invoking their Fifth Amendment privilege. No immunity grant has been issued for the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> witness, and <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> said there has been no decision on pursuing the agency's testimony Seal in February 1986 was assassinated in a <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La </LOCATION>. machine gun attack, as he pulled up in his <ORGANIZATION> Cadillac </ORGANIZATION> at a <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> halfway house. He was confined there part-time on a six-month sentence for narcotics and bank fraud convictions. In an interview Wednesday, <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> said, `` We're looking at whether ... an obstruction of justice'' caused the end of the Seal operation. `` The whole operation was aborted because of leaks to the media.'' Seal had contacts with the Colombian drug cartel and `` came in contact with at least one Sandinista,'' <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> said. In October 1985, Seal told a presidential organized crime commission that he quit his job as an airline pilot because `` smuggling was so simple, so lucrative.'' He said he easily eluded detection to fly tons of cocaine into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for a top fee of $ 1.5 million. `` I have landed clandestinely in probably every South American country there is,'' <PERSON> Seal </PERSON> said. `` There is no problem if you have the necessary contacts and dollars with you.'' Seal told panelists how fly-for-hire pilots take off and land without interference from authorities in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and other Latin American nations. Seal said he transported cocaine into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> while working for an illicit drug cartel he said was as sophisticated `` as any Fortune 500 company.'' He displayed night-vision goggles, telephone encryption devices and high-technology message-sending units. `` I do n't believe there's any paramilitary group better equipped than my former associates,'' he said.

 An Irish teen-ager who stowed away on a trans-Atlantic <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> destroyer with the alleged help of five <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sailors was turned over to a <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> investigator today to be escorted home. `` I just want to go home,'' <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Twomey </PERSON>, 16, of <PERSON> Cork </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, told Wake County Judge <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morelock </PERSON>, who placed her in the investigator's custody for a flight to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> and then on to <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> later today. Miss <PERSON> Twomey </PERSON> had apparently slipped onto the USS Conyngham while it was on a courtesy call in <LOCATION> Cork </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> and was discovered aboard the guided missile destroyer Saturday when it returned to <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, after a 10-day crossing. She was found in a 2 -LCB- - foot-wide, 15-foot-long, 3-foot-high compartment above a refrigeration unit that she shared with electrical wiring and pipes Five sailors accused of helping her stowaway were jailed at the <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> base. If charged and convicted, they could receive up to five years in prison and a $ 2,000 fine for aiding an illegal entry into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` There are no options but for her to return to <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Daire </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Criodain </PERSON>, a spokesman at the Irish embassy in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> O'Criodain </PERSON> said Miss <PERSON> Twomey </PERSON> is a minor and has no passport. `` She is in legal limbo. ... Our course is to get her out of this limbo as quickly as possible and get her home.'' Miss <PERSON> Twomey </PERSON> was released Wednesday from <ORGANIZATION> Rex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> after being treated for an undisclosed ailment. She was being taken to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> for a return flight when she became ill, forcing an emergency landing here, authorities said. Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told the judge today that Miss <PERSON> Twomey </PERSON> was a runaway and would be considered an undisciplined child under the American court system. The prosecutor wished Miss <PERSON> Twomey </PERSON> luck. `` I need it,'' she said. Miss <PERSON> Twomey </PERSON>, who originally told <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials she was orphaned, is the eldest of four children and has run away several times _ once having to be returned from <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, said a <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> police spokesman, who would not give his name. Her parents, <PERSON> John </PERSON> and <PERSON> Christine </PERSON> <PERSON> Twomey </PERSON>, had reported her missing, according to the spokesman. Mrs. <PERSON> Twomey </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Cork </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Examiner </ORGANIZATION> newspaper it was `` a pure disgrace'' that her daughter was able to slip through security and stay on board. The sailors who kept her hidden `` should not be allowed to get away with this,'' she said. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> is investigating how Miss <PERSON> Twomey </PERSON> was able to slip aboard the destroyer and be undetected for so long, said Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Surface </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>. The girl did not get into any secure areas, <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> said. `` We are cooperating with the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> to keep this as small a black eye as we can,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bitner </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION> office. <PERSON> Archie </PERSON> <PERSON> Galloway </PERSON>, another fleet spokesman, said the girl was treated for dehydration Saturday at the <LOCATION> Portsmouth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. He said a full physical found no health problems. A <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said the ariline had been asked by the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday to take Miss <PERSON> Twomey </PERSON> home but refused. `` We do n't feel we're medically equipped to handle such a happening, should the same thing happen ovver the middle of the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, referring to the girl's illness during the flight to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>

<HEAD>Postal Service Seeks `Seat Belt' for Stamps</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN W. CHALFANT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Postal Service began a 16-month, $ 700,000 quest Thursday to lick the problem of stamps that do n't stay stuck, urging industry to produce an adhesive to serve as a `` seat belt for a stamp. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morison </PERSON>, a senior assistant postmaster general, made it clear during a daylong conference at <ORGANIZATION> Battelle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> that the post office was serious about development of a superior, water-activated adhesive. `` Unfortunately, the news that we have made in the last few days is that we're spending a lot of money on something the press perceives as insignificant,'' <PERSON> Morison </PERSON> told about 100 adhesive industry executives and technical experts. He said the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> would spend nearly $ 90 million this year for stamps, sales of which would generate about $ 8 billion. `` I do n't believe there is a private company, including those that publish newspapers or sell their wares over the airwaves, that would hesitate to invest $ 700,000 to lower the cost of their product while making it perform better. That is exactly what we are doing,'' <PERSON> Morison </PERSON> said. `` We take it seriously because we know how important that stamp is to every American consumer,'' he told reporters during a break in the conference. `` We really believe that we have to have a stamp that operates very well.'' Adhesive now used by stamp manufacturers performs well when mail is sorted manually or mechanically. But the arrival of high-speed, automated processing, in which stamps are coated with a compound that activates processing equipment, has generated a need for a stronger adhesive that will keep a stamp on an envelope. `` The mail is moving very quickly through our system. In doing that, you are again putting a great deal of stress on the stamp,'' <PERSON> Morison </PERSON> said. He compared it to a speeding car running into a brick wall, sending a passenger without a seat belt into the windshield. `` You have the same thing in sorting mail. The letter is moving down the processing stream, and all of a sudden it stops. As soon as it stops, it's that same kind of force as the car hitting the brick wall,'' <PERSON> Morison </PERSON> said. `` What we are doing is developing an adhesive that will serve as a seat belt for a stamp.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> has heard from customers whose letters were destroyed or returned because the stamps fell off, he said. `` The problem ... has n't reached major proportions. But it is clear that it will as the speed of mail processing continues to increase as it must. The time to act is now, and we are turning to the adhesive industry for help,'' <PERSON> Morison </PERSON> told the conference. Dr. <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> McGinniss </PERSON>, the program project manager at <LOCATION> Battelle </LOCATION>, said industries will develop potential new adhesives and supply samples to the institute for extensive testing and evaluation. `` Ultimately, we will print real stamps that ... we will put into the mail stream. We'll take them back out, find out if they stuck, and if they stayed on then do the evaluations, a lot more testing,'' <PERSON> McGinniss </PERSON> said in an interview. <PERSON> Battelle </PERSON>, a not-for-profit, multinational research and development organization, will write adhesive specifications which the postal service can use in buying the product from suppliers. Although the research should produce stickier stamps, no change in taste is anticipated. `` Taste is a very personal thing. What we've always sought in taste, and where we think we are, is neutral and bland. And we'd like to stay neutral and bland,'' <PERSON> Morison </PERSON> said `` Taste is in the tongue of the users, and this contract really has nothing to do with that.''

<TEXT>
 Astronauts flying a jet modified to act like a space shuttle make steep 19-degree dives toward the desert floor Mondays through Fridays, flashing at 230 mph 20 feet above a runway of packed, white gypsum. Each time, they have to deal with a malfunctioning computer, broken landing gear, a non-working radio or some other problem generated by a sophisticated computer aboard the Grumman Gulfstream II jet. In addition to all their other shuttle training, astronauts also must practice for a possible landing at the alternative runway in the desert at <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sands </LOCATION>. `` It would be terrible if you had a good mission and messed it up with a bad landing,'' said <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Paczynski </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s project manager at White Sands Space Harbor. Shuttle commanders <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Hauck </PERSON> and shuttle pilot <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Covey </PERSON> practiced landings Wednesday in the modified jet. `` There's a humongous computer on board that takes the flight characteristics of the shuttle and the flight characteristics of the airplane and matches them together,'' <PERSON> Paczynski </PERSON> said. The computer can simulate a shuttle bringing back a heavy payload, or a stiff wind, or a system malfunction or a combination of problems. <PERSON> Hauck </PERSON> and <PERSON> Covey </PERSON> are scheduled to go up on the next shuttle flight, aboard Discovery, in September or October. A simulated countdown leading to a test firing of the shuttle's main engines ran into a snag Wednesday and was delayed 24 hours <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> engineers hope to fix a small gas leak in a vent line associated with a steering engine without taking Discovery off the pad and into a hangar, a move that could delay the launch as much as two months. The shuttle's primary landing site is <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, a dry lake bed with plenty of room to make up for a less-than-perfect landing. But if it rains at <LOCATION> Edwards </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hauck </PERSON> and <PERSON> Covey </PERSON> could end up gliding down to one of the two dazzlingly white, criss-cross runways at the White Sands dry lake bed. If they land at White Sands, on a dry lake bed between the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Andreas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> and White Sands National Monument, they will use a runway that has been leveled out a little better since <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lousma </PERSON> landed the shuttle <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> there on March 30, 1982. Engineers used lasers to check the smoothness of the runways, <PERSON> Paczynski </PERSON> said Wednesday as he led reporters on a tour of the 100-square-mile complex in the middle of White Sands Missile Range. They also leveled and flattened the surface 300 feet wide on either side of the 300-foot-wide landing strip, in effect making the runway 900 feet wide. At 35,000 feet long, the landing strips are about three times as long as those at commercial airports. July, August and September are the rainy months at <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sands </LOCATION>, when half of the annual 12 inches of rain falls. The `` dry'' lake bed was decidedly wet Wednesday because three-quarters of an inch of rain had fallen the night before, but it was still firm. `` Notice how the bus wo n't get bogged down when it comes to this wet spot,'' <PERSON> Paczynski </PERSON> told reporters as their bus approached a 50-yard-long puddle. `` There's a very hard mantle here 2 inches under the topsoil. That's why you could land an orbiter here even if -LRB- the strip -RRB- were underwater. They would n't, but they could.'' When the shuttle lands on the gypsum flats, it's as if it were landing on a mile-thick, 7-mile-long piece of Sheetrock, the panels used for interior walls. Prevailing southwesterly wind carries gypsum crystals from the lake bed to the famous dunes shimmering in the distance. The wind and the sharp gypsum crystals created havoc the one time a shuttle landed here. The de-service and mating area, where the astronauts disembark and where the shuttle is hoisted aboard a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 for the flight back to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, was so dusty that officials feared for the vessel's safety. So they've moved the area to a less dusty spot in the lee of the mountains, <PERSON> Paczynski </PERSON> said.

The 3-2 vote by the commission in this well-to-do <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> suburb asks Universal Pictures not to distribute the film unless it is changed `` to eliminate the fictional material which defames the character of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>.''

<HEAD>Pentagon Defends Prescription Stimulants For Pilots</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Pentagon officials on Thursday defended the use of prescribed stimulants to <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> pilots on long solo flights and said no recent crash has been linked to drug use. `` None of the crashes in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> was linked to drug use,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>. `` No crashes anywhere have been related to drug use.'' A West German television network reported Wednesday that <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> pilots there take Dexedrine to stay alert in flight and take the sedative Seconal to sleep afterwards. Concern has grown in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> following the crashes of five F-16 jet fighters in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> within three months this year. The West German network <ORGANIZATION> ARD </ORGANIZATION> quoted an unidentified <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> officer as saying that pilots take Dexedrine `` so that they are able to fly when they have n't gotten enough sleep or do n't feel fit enough.'' Consumer advocate <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON> of Public Citizen, appearing on the <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION> program `` Good Morning America, said his group was concerned about `` a military that has to depend upon using uppers and downers to perform well.'' <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON> said if commercial pilots used such drugs they would be fired or grounded. `` Imagine the scenario of a fighter pilot flying one of these planes having an hallucination and pressing the wrong button, particularly if there is a bomb on board,'' he said. <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> and other officials said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military pilots use such stimulants on long flights across the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> and Pacific Oceans, and not on exercises over populated areas. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> does not routinely prescribe medication to air crew members, but on long flights where pilot fatigue could present a significant safety risk, stimulant and sedative medications may be authorized by the major command surgeon general,'' said <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>. `` Dispensing of these medications is rigidly controlled. Routine use of these medications is never advised. The individual crew member makes the decision to take or not to take the medication,'' he said. Such use, he said, was confined almost exclusively to `` long flights. Dexedrine, Seconal and Temazepam -LRB- a stimulant -RRB- are prescribed almost exclusively for transoceanic solo missions in single-seat aircraft.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> was not considering any changes in the practice, which has been standard for as long as 30 years, spokesmen said. None of the other services, the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>, prescribe such drugs for pilots, <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> said. And the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement saying that it neither prescribed nor permitted the use of such drugs on flights by <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> pilots. `` The missions and environments in which <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> pilots fly are different,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> statement said. `` <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> pilots seldom fly long, uninterrupted flights in single or two-seater aircraft which <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> pilots do regularly in deploying aircraft across the ocean on training exercises.'' `` As a matter of policy, naval aviators are not given prescription stimulants or depressants for use during or after flight,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> statement said. `` Only caffeine in the form of coffee and triptophan in the form of warm milk are permitted for these purposes,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> statement said. Col. <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consultants </ORGANIZATION> Division of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> surgeon general's office, said in an interview on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION> that the service does `` on occasion prescribe medication to our pilots, but these are under very special circumstances. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> said he did not know how often the drugs are taken but said they have been used for `` 25 to 30 years, probably longer.''

<HEAD>Jordan Cancels Development Plan in Occupied Lands</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> canceled a $ 1.3 billion development plan in the Israeli-occupied lands Thursday as part of what officials called a plan to give the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> responsibility for the 1.5 million Palestinians living there. <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> state radio said the announcement was made after a Cabinet meeting led by Prime Minister <PERSON> Zaid </PERSON> <PERSON> Rifai </PERSON>. The radio said <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> would continue its `` national role as a confronation state and a prime party in the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict.'' A rebellion among the 1.5 million Palestinians in the occupied territories began Dec. 8 and has come largely under <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> direction. More than 230 Palestinians and four Israelis have been killed. A senior <LOCATION> Jordanian </LOCATION> official confirmed reports in the Arab press that King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> is making broad changes in <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s relationship with the Palestinians, but the radio quoted <PERSON> Rifai </PERSON> as saying the new measures `` will not harm the national unity among Palestinians and Jordanians in the kingdom.'' The five-year <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> development plan was established in 1986, by agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, to finance health, education, housing, and cultural and Islamic affairs projects in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> was under Jordanian rule until <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured it in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. Although <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> occupied the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> continued paying salaries and pensions of many goverment employees there, and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> representatives sit in the <ORGANIZATION> Jordanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. The 60-member upper house now includes 30 from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. Two-thirds of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s 3.5 million people are of Palestinian origin, including the entire population of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. A senior <LOCATION> Jordanian </LOCATION> official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said of Thursday's action: `` This is part of King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s decision to free himself from representation of the Palestinian people and leaves the doors open for the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> to shoulder responsibility on its own. The king's decision also reflects the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s wish to take over all <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> affairs in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. According to the radio, <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> will `` urge friendly and brotherly countries to continue their support and financial assistance to the Palestinian uprising in the occupied territories.'' On Wednesday, the Saudi newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Al-Sharq </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> al-Awsat </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Rifai </PERSON> as saying `` decisive developments'' were planned to give Palestinians greater responsibility as an entity. Al-Qabas, a Kuwaiti newspaper, predicted Wednesday that <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> would dissolve <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and change the government, with <PERSON> Marwan </PERSON> <PERSON> Qassem </PERSON>, the royal court minister, the strongest candidate to succeed <PERSON> Rifai </PERSON>. It said <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> had decided to dissociate himself from the Palestinian question and let the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> take the responsibility. Al-Qabas, which usually is well-informed on <LOCATION> Jordanian </LOCATION> affairs, said <PERSON> Rifai </PERSON> would become <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s personal representative. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leaders said they expected no major change in <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s policy Prime Minster <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said: `` We still see the Jordanians as a partner in direct peace negotiations. ... This does n't change anything as far as we're concerned.'' Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, who has encouraged <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> to form a joint negotiating delegation with moderate Palestinians, said of <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s action: `` What he's doing is not a change in policy but a purely technical move.'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said it would have no effect as long as the king `` does not declare war on us and does not close the <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> bridges'' or prevent Palestinians from holding Jordanian passports.

 Two factions in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s civil war exchanged sharp words Thursday, indicating that major hurdles remain on the road to peace after four days of unprecented talks. Despite the differences, the informal talks resulted in a broad convergence of views on key issues and on the urgent need for a political settlement, said a closing statement from <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Alatas </PERSON>, who hosted the gathering. Participating were <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, its ally <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>, the Vietnam-backed Cambodian government, the three guerrilla groups fighting <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s occupation and the pro-guerrilla Association of Southeast Asian Nations: <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Brunei </LOCATION> Their representatives gathered at the old presidential palace in <LOCATION> Bogor </LOCATION>, 40 miles outside <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Khieu </PERSON> <PERSON> Samphan </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla faction, called <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s contention that the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> meeting had reached broad agreement `` a shameless lie'' aimed at perpetuating its occupation of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> `` forever through its puppet regime.'' He accused <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s foreign minister, <ORGANIZATION> Nguyen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thach </ORGANIZATION>, of rejecting all guerrilla peace proposals at the talks. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, he said, must unconditionally withdraw from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> instead of linking a pullout to demands that steps be taken to insure the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> does not return to power. <PERSON> Thach </PERSON>'s statements to reporters were aimed at `` deceiving the international community'' he added. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> leader, told a news conference that his party and the guerrilla resistance `` have made efforts to find common ground. It was a pity that the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> rejected our proposal.'' He said they proposed a national reconciliation council with the former guerrilla alliance leader, Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, in charge that would include political but not military participation by the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> invaded <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in December 1978 to halt bloody attacks on its western border by the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, who had killed hundreds of thousands of people in trying to transform <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> into a primitive agrarian society during its 1975-79 rule. The communist <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> is now allied in a guerrilla coalition with the forces of <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s former monarch, and <PERSON> Son </PERSON> <PERSON> Sann </PERSON> of the non-communist <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Thach </PERSON> said Wednesday the talks had resolved `` the most difficult problems'' and there was agreement in general terms though not on details. One agreement was the need for steps to prevent a <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> return, he said. On Thursday, <PERSON> Thach </PERSON> said he was `` half-happy'' with the talks and declared <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> was `` determined to have a political solution before 1990,'' its self-imposed deadline for withdrawing its more than 100,000 occupation troops. A desire to avoid a post-1990 civil war led the conflicting parties to the <LOCATION> Bogor </LOCATION> talks. The participants agreed to form working groups of senior officials of all sides to study issues of contention and, by year's end, make recommendations for another round of talks Even <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>'s hard-line foreign minister, <PERSON> Suppiah </PERSON> <PERSON> Dhanabalan </PERSON>, called the talks `` a very important psychological breakthrough,'' as the first meeting among all the warring parties. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON>, head of the Phnom Phen government, confirmed he would meet with <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> in October for a third round of talks. They met in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in December and January, and <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> canceled a planned third round. <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, who ruled <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> from 1941-70 and is widely considered essential to a future government, recently resigned as president of the resistance coalition, saying the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> was killing his men. <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> refused to go to <LOCATION> Bogor </LOCATION>, where the talks were held. But he reclaimed center stage by meeting Wednesday in <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION> with his guerrilla partners and Hun Sen. His son, Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Ranariddh </PERSON>, represented <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> at <LOCATION> Bogor </LOCATION>. The statement issued by <PERSON> Alatas </PERSON>, the host, said participants agreed the two key issues of the Cambodian problem `` are the withdrawal of Vietnamese forces from <LOCATION> Kampuchea </LOCATION>, to be carried out within the context of an overall political solution and the prevention of the recurrence of genocidal policies and practices of the Pol Pot -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- regime and to ensure the cessation of all foreign interference and external arms supplies to the opposing Kampuchean forces.'' They also agreed on the need for definite timetables and an international presence to supervise these processes, it said. <PERSON> Alatas </PERSON> said no official communique was issued because the talks were informal. Diplomatic sources said <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, the two hardest-line states on the issue, were upset by what they saw as <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> besting the others, and led opposition to a communique.

 Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said Thursday he finds acting Deputy Attorney General <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Christensen </PERSON>'s optimistic assessment of <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> morale `` somewhat incredible'' and said he is concerned <PERSON> Christensen </PERSON> `` is going over there with blinders on.'' <PERSON> Christensen </PERSON> was the third <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> nominee in two days to reject testimony by former Deputy Attorney General <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> that the department had been gripped in a `` deep malaise'' when he resigned March 29 to protest Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>'s continued tenure At his confirmation hearing before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Christensen </PERSON> said that when he came to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> early last month he quickly saw that its operations were running effectively. `` I think morale is high,'' <PERSON> Christensen </PERSON> testified. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., questioned <PERSON> Christensen </PERSON>'s portrayal twice during the hearing and repeatedly asked the nominee why he had n't met with <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> and former criminal division chief <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> about their protest resignations stemming from <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s refusal to step down in the face of an ongoing criminal <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> said he quit because he felt <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> had committed ethical violations and probably commited crimes as well. <PERSON> Christensen </PERSON> said he found it inappropriate to inquire since he might be in a position at some point of having to make judgments of his own. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said that should have prompted <PERSON> Christensen </PERSON> `` to ask more questions, not fewer.'' <PERSON> Christensen </PERSON> said he enjoys a close working relationship with <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, meeting with him usually two or three times a day, and that he has formed no judgments of his own about ethical or legal questions regarding the attorney general. Hours after independent counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> sent an 814-page report on <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s activities to a panel of judges on July 5, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> announced he would resign, and he plans to leave next month. <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> conducted a 14-month inquiry into <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s actions at the request of attorney <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> on behalf of scandal-plagued <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and a $ 1 billion Iraqi pipeline project, plus <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s tax filings and his stock holdings in <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> telephone companies <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> concluded <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> `` probably'' broke two tax laws and twice violated a federal conflict-of-interest statute. But <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> decided not to indict the attorney general. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> sharply criticized the findings and said he had been exonerated. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said he found <PERSON> Christensen </PERSON>'s comments `` somewhat incredible'' and added that he is concerned the nominee `` is going over there with blinders on.'' The acting deputy attorney general replied, `` I do n't think so, senator.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Professional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Responsibility </ORGANIZATION> is conducting an ethics inquiry of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s activities in the wake of the report by <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>, who decided against seeking an indictment of the attorney general. The office could issue a highly critical report of the attorney general's ethics. `` I would expect that office to discharge its responsibility,'' <PERSON> Christensen </PERSON> said. `` I would certainly not interfere with that office discharging its responsibility.'' At another point in the hearing he said, `` I would support what they are obligated to do.'' If confirmed as deputy attorney general, the 62-year-old <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> attorney almost certainly will be serving under <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, the former <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> GOP governor whose nomination for attorney general has been widely praised by Republicans and Democrats. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s confirmation hearing is set for Aug. 5. <PERSON> Christensen </PERSON>, who became acting deputy attorney general June 1 _ his first government job _ was president of the <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> in 1975-76.

 A millionaire businessman who promised to bankroll a new life for a welfare mother of five faces criminal charges and a $ 1.4 million judgment in a bank fraud and is not free to spend his money, attorneys said today. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Gisclair </PERSON> had offered to buy a house for <PERSON> Anita </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> and her family and provide her with a job, a college education, a car and a nurse to care for the children. But court records show that a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> won a civil judgment against him after alleging in state court that <PERSON> Gisclair </PERSON> defrauded the lender out of $ 1.3 million. The judgment includes interest on that amount. The criminal charges stem from the civil case, according to Chief Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregorie </PERSON>, who filed charges against <PERSON> Gisclair </PERSON> two weeks ago in federal court accusing him of making a false statement to a bank. Capital's attorney, <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Culverhouse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, said today that he understands <PERSON> Gisclair </PERSON> must satisfy any outstanding judgments before he can freely spend his money. The attorney added that in a deposition filed after the judgment, <PERSON> Gisclair </PERSON> said his businesses were worthless. <PERSON> Gisclair </PERSON> did not immediately return calls to this <LOCATION> Boca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Raton </LOCATION> office today. He said Wednesday that he made his promise to <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> because he felt like `` nobody was doing more than lip service to make a difference'' about poverty. `` I kept driving by and seeing the homeless,'' he said. `` It started to really bother me. ... I honestly became consumed by the urge to do something about it.'' For 28-year-old <PERSON> Anita </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>, struggling to raise her children, including a month-old son, in a drug-ridden inner-city <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> neighborhood dubbed `` The Hole,'' his offer is a `` fairy tale'' come true. `` I ca n't believe this is happening to me,'' she said. `` It's just a miracle from God I've struggled and hoped for so long to get my children out of this neighborhood and into a safe environment.'' <PERSON> Gisclair </PERSON>, a 43-year-old <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> native and principal owner of six <LOCATION> Boca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Raton </LOCATION> enterprises, including a real estate management company and a restaurant, found the family through <PERSON> Livia </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. He told her he wanted to help real people he could see and talk to. `` My idea is to see exactly where my money is going and be able to measure its success,'' said <PERSON> Gisclair </PERSON>, who has four children. `` The idea is to get <PERSON> Anita </PERSON> to become self-sufficient to the point where she can pay her own rent on the house, pay her own bills and do everything on her own someday. I plan to pay for everything until she reaches that point.'' He said he would find a home for the family in <LOCATION> Boca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Raton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Delray </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Deerfield </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, about 100 miles north of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> would work during the day and attend <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> at night so she could pursue her goal of becoming an accountant. It's not the first time <PERSON> Gisclair </PERSON> has tried the idea. An earlier effort to help a welfare mother with four children failed because `` she was totally unwilling to participate,'' <PERSON> Gisclair </PERSON> said. `` And then one day she asked me to pay half of her rent because her ex-husband did n't come through with the money. I volunteered to pay it directly to her landlord, but she said, ` No, send it to me.' That was enough for me to realize I was being connned.'' That's why <PERSON> Gisclair </PERSON>'s has attached some conditions. `` I just want Anita to be honest with me,'' he said. `` I want her to become self-sufficient, and she has promised to have no more children. I will see to it that she gets medical care as well to take care of that.'' Ms. <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> said <PERSON> Gisclair </PERSON>'s conditions are `` tiny'' compared to the chance he's giving her family. She said the neighborhood she lives now is so dangerous she does n't let her children _ <PERSON> Kentrail </PERSON>, 10, <PERSON> Krystal </PERSON>, 4, <PERSON> Grady </PERSON>, 3, <PERSON> Alex </PERSON>, 1, and <LOCATION> Antjon </LOCATION>, 1 month _ play outside. `` It's like a fairy tale,'' she said. `` These things do n't happen every day and they never happen to me. <PERSON> Gisclair </PERSON> said he was shocked by the family's poverty when he met Ms. <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> on a visit to her cramped, one-bedroom apartment Friday. `` There was one bed and a hot plate,'' he said. `` But the place is immaculate and so are the children. `` They're well disciplined; they're clean. If you took one look at their smiles you'd want to do the same thing.''

<HEAD>Chemical-Germ Weapons Research Could Endanger Nearby Communities</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Research into chemical and biological weapons could be dangerous to surrounding communities, according to a safety review, but the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday its safety precautions are enough to protect against accidents. The Pentagon has `` stringent and necessary safety precautions'' for its chemical weapons program, said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Welch </PERSON>, deputy assistant secretary of <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> for chemical weapons. <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> defended the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s safety standards in an appearance before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Governmental Affairs oversight subcommittee, which has been investigating the safety of the two programs. A subcommittee staff report earlier this year found that the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> lacked firm safety regulations for research into biological weapons and outlined safety lapses in both chemical and biological programs. The Pentagon last year began building chemical weapons for the first time since 1969 and research is conducted at government and private laboratories in about 150 locations throughout the country, according to the subcommittee. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has formally renounced the use of biological warfare since 1969, but the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spends an increasing amount of money to develop defenses for a variety of types of germ warfare that might be used against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces. Spending for biological and chemical research has increased sharply since President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> took office in 1981. In fiscal 1980, the total research was $ 63.5 million, compared with the $ 348 million figure for fiscal 1986. The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, in a report presented to the committee, said there are a number of potential dangers among the chemical and biological research sites scattered around the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Dr. <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON>, a former microbologist at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Detrick </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, told the panel that in 1981 the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> lost about two quarts of a potentially dangerous virus used as a vaccine against a highly infectious disease and has not been able to account satisfactorily for the missing virus since then. Military officials dispute Dr. <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON>'s contentions and said the virus vaccine had been sterilized by a technician. <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, in its chemical weapons program, `` applies stringent safety, storage, maintenance, use and accounting requirements for all internal and contractor facilities that use chemical agents.'' Those requirements included unannounced inspections and rehearsals for hypothetical accidents, he said. In <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, on Thursday, <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedersdorf </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegate to the Conference on Disarmament, named officially for the first time the location of five chemical weapons production facilities in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. They are located at: the <ORGANIZATION> Rocky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arsenal </ORGANIZATION>, in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>; the <ORGANIZATION> Pine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bluff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arsenal </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>; Muscle Shoals in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Newport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ammunition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Depot </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>; and <ORGANIZATION> Aberdeen </ORGANIZATION> Proving Ground in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>. However, an <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, Lt. Col. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapla </PERSON>, said chemical weapons currently are only produced or stored at Pine Bluff and Muscle Shoals. `` These are locations which are at present or were at one time involved in the production of chemical weapons,'' <PERSON> Chapla </PERSON> said of the five sites named by <PERSON> Friedersdorf </PERSON>. At <LOCATION> Rocky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION>, there is no chemical weapon production, testing or storage going on.'' <ORGANIZATION> Aberdeen </ORGANIZATION> is used to test some components of the current generation of chemical weapons, but is not used to produce, store or test the binary, or dual chemical weapons that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military now uses, <PERSON> Chapla </PERSON> said. `` Our focus now is the production of binary chemical, principally at Pine Bluffs,'' <PERSON> Chapla </PERSON> said. Some work is also done at Muscle Shoals on one of the chemicals used in the production of binary weapons, but the weapon is not deadly until the two chemicals are combined, he said. `` The binary program is such that you never have a complete weapon stored in any one place. The two chemicals are never kept together and they will not be mated until just before firing,'' <PERSON> Chapla </PERSON> said. As for biological weapons, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> has proposed building a $ 5.4 million biological aerosol test facility at the Dugway Proving Ground in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>. At Thursday's hearing, <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> said that in response to the subcommittee's report last May, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> will require that its biological research program comply with biosafety standards set by the federal <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>. Previously, that compliance was only a recommendation, not a requirement. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> noted that in addition to Pentagon requirements, the programs also must meet local and state safety standards. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> approaches safety for the programs in two different ways, the study said. For private companies doing research into chemical weapons, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> has `` developed and implemented a reasonably systemic and comprehensive approach for evaluating and managing risks,'' the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said. But it recommended that the Pentagon work harder at looking at potential accidents. No Pentagon safety requirements have been done for biological weapons research, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said. Instead, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> `` relies on an existing safeguards system that was developed by the biomedical'' establishment. `` Biological defense research and development poses recognized health and safety risks, thus adequate protective measures need to be implemented,'' the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> warned. The review noted that about `` 10 percent of the biological defense program contracts involve genetic engineering techniques to study disease processes. The use of genetic engineering and recombinant DNA molecules has been a subject of concern because of the risks associated with the possible creation of modified agents and their potential release into the environment.'' For that reason, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> noted, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> requires the contractors to follow <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> guidelines for research involving genetic engineering.

 Federal judges in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bridgeport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, today refused to unseal search warrant information on the Pentagon bribery probe, saying release of the documents might compromise the investigation. News organizations had requested the information, which consists of affidavits filed by prosecutors in order to gain warrants to search defense contractors' offices. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenyon </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> reversed a ruling by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Reichmann </PERSON> earlier this month that the documents from the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> portion of the investigation should be unsealed. `` On balance,'' <PERSON> Kenyon </PERSON> said, `` the public's interest in a complete and uninhibited investigation strongly outweighs its need for or right of access to the search warrant affidavits at this time.'' The government has released minor portions of some documents but fought for secrecy on more important information. Earlier this month in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, the government released 30 pages that showed federal agents wiretapped telephone conversations to gather information on <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Litton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Bridgeport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge T.F. <PERSON> Gilroy </PERSON> <PERSON> Daly </PERSON> said the documents sought by The <ORGANIZATION> Hartford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Courant </ORGANIZATION> `` are extremely detailed and contain information that would certainly endanger the ongoing grand jury proceedings.'' The newspaper had sought documents on searches at <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> offices of <ORGANIZATION> Norden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary. `` There is a right under the First Amendment of access to court documents,'' the judge said. `` But at this early stage, the right is a qualified and limited one.'' The government agreed, however, to unseal very limited parts of the documents that describe the person who swore out the affidavit and the premises searched, and the introductory section of the affidavit. <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Elliot </PERSON>, the Courant's attorney, said the ruling was `` more limited than other judges have made and it is disappointing.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> investigation centers on allegations that defense contractors and consultants, many of them former military men, bribed <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials for inside information useful in winning contracts worth billions of dollars. <PERSON> Norden </PERSON> is suspected of benefiting from inside information to build a battlefield communication system for the <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION>, according to other documents already released in the investigation. Earlier this month, <PERSON> Norden </PERSON> withdrew from the bidding for the communications system, citing the suspicions raised by the investigation. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Twardy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, said today, however, that a Norden program not disclosed so far is the only one under investigation. He declined further comment. <PERSON> Norden </PERSON> officials did not immediately return telephone calls. The Courant last week asked for release of documents related to the June 14 search of <LOCATION> Norden </LOCATION> offices in <LOCATION> Bridgeport </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Trumbull </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Norwalk </LOCATION> and a June 15 search of the <PERSON> Shelton </PERSON> home of <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rapinac </PERSON>, a senior vice president. The information released today said federal agents searched the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Norwalk </LOCATION> office of <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Kingston </PERSON>, <PERSON> Norden </PERSON> executive vice president, and other areas of the building where his documents are stored and his secretary sits. The documents also said agents went to <LOCATION> Norden </LOCATION> offices occupied by <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> and Vice President <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Engle </PERSON>, and other areas of the building where documents, calendars, files and other information they keep would be stored. It was n't known what position <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> holds.

<HEAD>Administration, Key Democrats Oppose U.S., Vietnamese Relations
Now</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and key <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democrats on Thursday voiced opposition to any move at this time to establish <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Vietnamese diplomatic interest sections in <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. But administration officials held out the promise of full diplomatic relations between the two former adversaries if Vietnamese troops are withdrawn from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. Principal support for establishing diplomatic interest sections in the two capitals came from a pair of Republicans, including Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, who spent years as a war prisoner during the Vietnamese war. `` It is a modest step,'' <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. `` It's sole purpose is to speed progress in a number of issues, including Americans missing in action, emigration of Amerasians through the orderly departure program, the release of Vietnamese in re-education camps and the continued Vietnamese occupation of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridge </PERSON>, R-Pa., contended the time is ripe for such a step because the Vietnamese have made it clear they will leave <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, because the <LOCATION> Vietnamese </LOCATION> economy is shattered, because a new generation is taking power in <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>, and because an opportunity exists to woo the Vietnamese away from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> `` Senator <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> and I agreed that the status quo was horribly unacceptable and unsatisfactory,'' <PERSON> Ridge </PERSON> said. `` The parents of our MIA's still wait for word on their missing heroes.'' An interest section is the lowest type of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomatic contact with another nation and does not involve the establishment of formal diplomatic relations of any kind. Officials of the two nations involved generally use office space in an embassy of a third nation. <PERSON> Gaston </PERSON> <PERSON> Sigur </PERSON>, assistant secretary of state for East Asian and <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> affairs, said the administration believes that establishing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Vietnamese interest sections now would harm <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interests, hand <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> `` a major political victory'' and perhaps rekindle <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>'s determination to stay in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. `` We have refrained from establishing normal diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> as a demonstration of our opposition to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s illegal occupation of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Sigur </PERSON> said. `` Were we now to agree to the establishment of interest sections in our respective capitals, this would represent a fundamental change in our policy of supporting the diplomatic isolation of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, deputy assistant secretary of <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> for <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> affairs, said that establishing a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomatic presence in <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> now `` would encourage hardliners in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> _ who do not wish to leave <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> _ by removing the pressure.'' `` We must keep the pressure on because it is working,'' he said. `` We must maintain the policy of ... no aid, no trade, no normalization.'' That policy will change eventually, but for the time being the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> position must be `` Normalization _ yes _ fine _ but not now,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. As Thursday's hearing concluded, Rep. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, the subcommittee chairman, said he agreed that the time has not come to establish diplomatic ties of any kind. `` I come away from the hearing even more convinced it would be potentially counterproductive to proceed with interest sections at this time,'' <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON> said. `` I think the downside is very clear. But the time will come, and I hope it comes soon.'' <PERSON> Sigur </PERSON> said progress is being made toward ending the Vietnamese occupation of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and that a full dialogue is under way on humanitarian issues. `` Given the current level of cooperation, we do not believe that more formal diplomatic structures are required,'' he said. But <PERSON> Sigur </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> opposition to setting up interest sections now `` should not be seen as a sign that the administration remains implacably hostile toward <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>.'' `` We hold no malice toward <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> as a result of the war in <LOCATION> Indochina </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` In fact we look forward to the time when we will be able to enter into normal diplomatic and commercial relations with <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and have made it clear we are prepared to normalize'' if there is a complete Vietnamese troop withdrawal from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>.

Rear Adm. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fogarty </PERSON>, who heads the team, was to report to the commander of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, Gen. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crist </PERSON>, at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Central Command headquarters in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Crist </PERSON>, in turn, will give classified and unclassified versions of the report to the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>, Adm. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON>, who will pass them, with his comments, to <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> for a final review. `` I understand that Adm. <PERSON> Fogarty </PERSON> is prepared to report to Gen. <PERSON> Crist </PERSON> next week,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>. `` The process involves review by Gen. <PERSON> Crist </PERSON> with his comments, then Adm. <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON>, and the secretary of <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION>, and nothing ensues until that review process is completed. We do n't go public until the process is completed. In short, do n't expect anything next week,'' <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> said. Pentagon officials have promised to release as soon as possible an unclassified report on why the USS Vicennes shot down the <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> A300 <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> with 290 aboard on July 3. At the time, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials said the officers on the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> mistook the airliner for an attacking F-14 fighter. The chief <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, told reporters Thursday that officials were trying to avoid a repetition of the delays experienced in releasing a report on the May 17, 1987, attack on the USS Stark by an Iraqi fighter. `` In the case of the Stark investigation, it was five months before the report was actually released. We'd like to do a better job of getting it to you earlier,'' <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said it was `` unlikely'' the report would be released before <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> returns Aug. 8 from a trip to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. `` I do n't have a timetable for release,'' said <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>. <PERSON> Fogarty </PERSON>, originally asked to complete his investigation by July 15, was granted an extension through the end of July.

<HEAD>Spurt In Consumer Spending Fuels Inflation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Consumer spending increased in June at the fastest pace in 10 months, the government said Thursday, fueling concern over inflation and whether the economy will have room for production of exports. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said personal consumption spending, which includes virtually everything except interest on debt, shot up a seasonally adjusted 1.0 percent in June, the steepest climb since a 1.3 percent gain in August, two months before the October stock market crash. The report was a disappointment to many economists who are looking for growth in consumer demand to slow in order to narrow the nation's trade deficit. Excessive consumer demand implies that imports will grow and that factories will have difficulty increasing production of exports if they also have to step up manufacture of goods for domestic buyers. This strain on factory capacity could add to inflation if buyers bid up the price of scarce goods. In another economic report adding to inflation concerns, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said import prices, one of the main inflationary threats facing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy because of the weaker dollar, rose 2.7 percent in the April-June quarter, the biggest increase in more than a year. The climb followed a 1.2 percent increase in the January-March period and was the steepest since the 4.1 percent jump in the first three months of 1987, which was attributed almost entirely to rising crude oil prices. Most analysts were expecting consumer demand to slow after the October stock market crash, but that has not happened. `` There's some real danger here that we will end up with too much of a good thing,'' warned <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Aubrey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lanston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a government securities dealer in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` This consumer spending is so strong it probably will trigger, at some point, <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> actions to push interest rates higher,'' he said, adding that the move most likely will come after Aug. 16 when <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> policymakers next meet to consider monetary policy. <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, appearing before a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Banking subcommittee on Thursday, repeated a warning delivered to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> two weeks ago that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> was likely to err on the side of tightening the money supply, rather than loosening. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said the 4.7-percent inflation figure released Wednesday as part of the report on the second quarter gross national product was `` somewhat larger than we would have expected.'' However, he said recent economic indicators have shown no evidence that would cause the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> to radically change its policy. `` There have been a lot of data ... but none has altered either my or, as far as I can judge, the board's general view as to where we are going and where we have been ... In a certain sense, it has been a period in which there have been fewer surprises than normal,'' he said. The report on consumer spending also showed that Americans' personal income jumped a healthy 0.7 percent to $ 4.04 trillion in June, the best showing in three months It followed a 0.5 percent rise in May, a modest 0.2 percent increase in April and a 1.0 percent jump in March. The gain in income in part reflected healthy increases in employment in June. The unemployment rate dropped to 5.3 percent last month, a 14-year low. With spending rising a bit faster than income, Americans' personal savings rate fell slightly to 4.3 percent, compared with 4.4 percent in May Still, the average savings rate for the first half of 1988, 4.1 percent, is up substantially from 3.2 percent in 1987. Americans' after-tax income increased a seasonally adjusted 0.8 percent in June after shooting up 2.4 percent in May. The department said tax payments declined in both May and June after higher-than-average payments in April. The department gave these details of spending: _ On durable goods, `` big ticket'' items expected to last three or more years, spending rose $ 8.6 billion in June compared with an increase of $ 2.7 billion in May _ On non-durable goods, spending rose $ 4.5 billion in June, compared with $ 4.6 billion the month before _ On services, spending rose $ 17.7 billion last month, compared with $ 11.3 billion in May <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaber </PERSON>, an economist with the <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> consulting firm, said the June increase in personal spending was not as alarming as it might have been because it was likely temporarily bolstered by heavy use of electrical power to run air conditioners. `` The trend in consumer spending is about 2 percent -LRB- annual -RRB- growth. Certainly it's not driving the economy,'' she said.

 Tamil rebels stabbed and hacked to death 14 Sinhalese farmers on Thursday, the military said. The killings occurred on the first anniversary of an accord aimed at ending the nation's civil war. The military accused a Tamil rebel group called the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> for killing the cinnamon farmers near <LOCATION> Padaviya </LOCATION> village in northeastern <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>. The slaughter occurred even though the military had placed soldiers on a nationwide alert to prevent violence on the anniversary. About 50,000 Indian troops also imposed a curfew in some Tamil strongholds in northern <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>. Two farmers escaped with stab injuries and alerted a nearby Sri Lankan army camp, said a military official who can not be identified under briefing rules. Sri Lankan troops who arrived at the scene found some of the victims tied to trees, the officials said. All the victims were males. A 24-hour curfew will be imposed beginning Friday morning in southern <LOCATION> Matara </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hambantota </LOCATION> districts, state radio announced. `` Stern action will be taken against those violating peace,'' the report said. Sinhalese extremists of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> have issued handbills and posters calling for two days of `` national resistance'' to protest the accord. The front called on people to stay indoors, stay home from their jobs and switch off the lights in their homes at night. Posters by the <ORGANIZATION> Patriotic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, the front's military wing, threatened to take unspecified action against people who ignore its orders Tamil rebel groups and the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> oppose the peace accord signed by Indian Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Junius </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> one year ago. The accord offers limited autonomy to Tamils living in northern and eastern sections of the country.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> demanded a formal peace treaty wih <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, not just a cease-fire, and asked the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday to guarantee its enforcement. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the Iranian <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> said: `` The policy of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> is to put obstacles in the way of the secretary-general's peace efforts. This whole Iraqi exercise is planned to sabotage the efforts upon which the international community is looking with hope.'' Both sides reported fighting at <LOCATION> Eslamabad </LOCATION>, 60 miles inside <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, which says it has withdrawn from Iranian territory, describes the invaders as Iranian rebels but <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> claims they are Iraqi troops. Iraqi television said <PERSON> Saadun </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, the acting foreign minister, summoned the ambassadors of the five permanent <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> members _ <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> _ and insisted on a peace treaty. `` This is the only way to secure a peaceful settlement'' of the 8-year-old war, he was quoted as saying. He added, however, that `` <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> is for an early, immediate cease-fire as a means to end the war within the framework of a comprehensive peace settlement.'' <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> negotiations are being conducted under <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> Resolution 598, the year-old proposal <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> says it will accept. It provides for a cease-fire followed by withdrawal to recognized borders, prisoner exchange, peace negotiations and an investigation of which side started the war. <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> secretary-general, said in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> responded positively to his proposals for implementing the resolution and was awaiting <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s reaction. He has met with the foreign ministers of the two countries, <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tariq </PERSON> <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> is <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s acting foreign minister while <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> is in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> also said he hopes <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> will consider `` at some stage'' holding direct talks with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, which insists on them. He said talks at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> were suspended for `` reflection'' Thursday. Iraqi television quoted <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> as telling the ambassadors: `` Lasting and comprehensive peace is the only way <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> will not change its position in the future. The peace treaty should be guaranteed by the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> member states. `` A cease-fire would not end the state of war and instability in the region.'' <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> also restated <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s position that it `` has no ambitions in Iranian territory.'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said its forces broke through the defenses of Iraqi troops and Iranian rebels at <LOCATION> Eslamabad </LOCATION> inside the central border, killing at least 4,000 Iraqis and `` mercenaries,'' according to a dispatch of the official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. Spokesmen of the <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Khalq </ORGANIZATION>, an Iranian rebel movement based in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, said units of its <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> were holding <PERSON> Eslamabad </PERSON>. A communique from <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s military said its warplanes were bombing Iranian military airfields in the area, indicating the Iraqis at least were providing air support. The rebels claim to have occupied Eslamabad and nearby <ORGANIZATION> Karand </ORGANIZATION>, but <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> says the invasion has been led by regular Iraqi troops. An Iraqi communique read on television reported continuing fighting on the border front, despite the claims that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s soldiers had withdrawn from Iranian territory occupied over the past week It said said warplanes flew 173 sorties and attacked helicopter landing strips east of <LOCATION> Eslamabad </LOCATION>. The comminique also said the jets destroyed an Iranian helicopter base in <LOCATION> Bakhtaran </LOCATION>, 30 miles from <LOCATION> Eslamabad </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> said Iranian fighter bombers and helicopters flew 175 sorties over the central and southern fronts. Dispatches from the official news agency said Iranian forces had regained more than 150 square miles in the central sector and two northern peaks. Iranian television, also monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, showed what it said were Iranian soldiers entering Eslamabad. Dispatches from the news agency said the bodies of many Iranian rebels were found, including young women. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said the `` terrorists, known as the Munafiqeen -LRB- hypocrites -RRB-, were also equipped with anti-chemical masks, first aid kits, Iraqi cigarettes and alcoholic drinks brewed in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>.'' Islam forbids the drinking of alcohol. `` Among other things found in the pockets of slain ... women terrorists were contraceptive pills, which show the widespread promiscuity in the ranks of both the Munafiqeen and the Iraqis,'' it said.

 Police who shot and wounded an escapee recognized him as the man they shot and wounded five years ago in the arrest that sent him to prison. Both shootings came at the end of wild chases that resulted in wrecks after the man fled across the same bridge. Before the latest incident, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reichman </PERSON>, 37, was handcuffed to other inmates in a van taking them to court appearances Wednesday at the <ORGANIZATION> Escambia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judicial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Reichman </PERSON> apparently used a paper clip to unlock his handcuffs and then fled. Officer <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Ogle </PERSON> fired two shots at the escapee but missed, said Capt. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> McFann </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Escambia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION>. While <PERSON> Ogle </PERSON> guarded the other inmates, security officers gave chase on foot. The escapee fled through an alley and pulled courthouse employee <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Smiley </PERSON> from her parked car. `` Ma'am, I got to use your car, I got to use your car,'' Ms. <PERSON> Smiley </PERSON> said the man told her. <PERSON> Reichman </PERSON> then drove across a three-mile-long bridge over <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> and into Gulf Breeze, authorities said. Gulf Breeze police joined the chase. A tire was blown out when the car hit a curb and the vehicle then skidded into a guide wire on a utility pole, said <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Breeze </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. He said Detective <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnwell </PERSON> fired three shots when <PERSON> Reichman </PERSON> jumped from the car. Two of the bullets struck him. <PERSON> Reichman </PERSON> was in stable condition Thursday at <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION>. He was admitted with gunshot wounds in the left leg and buttock. In November 1983, <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Breeze </ORGANIZATION> Officer <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> <PERSON> McFee </PERSON>, who now works elsewhere, tried to stop <PERSON> Reichman </PERSON> for a traffic violation. <PERSON> Reichman </PERSON> fled across the same bridge but in the opposite direction and wrecked his car. He exchanged gunfire with <PERSON> McFee </PERSON>, who wounded <PERSON> Reichman </PERSON> in the eye and leg. <PERSON> Reichman </PERSON> was then convicted of bank robbery, attempted second-degree murder of a police officer and other crimes. He was being taken to court Wednesday for resentencing after an appeals court overturned his original 25-year term on technical grounds. <PERSON> Reichman </PERSON> now faces additional charges of escape, grand theft of an automobile, fleeing police officers and resisting arrest.

 Polish Foreign Minister <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Olechowski </PERSON> met Thursday with Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and said both sides are determined to work toward further improvements in Polish-American relations. <PERSON> Olechowski </PERSON>, the first Polish foreign minister to visit <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in nine years, said he invited <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> to visit <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. The response was one of `` general approval,'' he said but no details were discussed. Polish-American relations hit bottom after <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> imposed martial law in 1981 and outlawed the independent trade union Solidarity. The reconciliation process began about two years ago, highlighted by a visit to <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> last October by Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the lifting by last year of the economic sanctions that had been imposed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` We have normalized our relations,'' <PERSON> Olechowski </PERSON> told reporters after a two-hour meeting with <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and other senior officials from both sides. Although progress in bilateral relations has been made, `` we certainly hope it's not the end of the road,'' <PERSON> Olechowski </PERSON> said. He said the `` ambitions, the interests and the intentions'' of both countries are extensive and there is `` a determination on both ends to go ahead.'' There is room for increased political contacts and economic and cultural cooperation, he said. `` In all areas, there are possibilities.'' One source of friction between the two countries is <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s claim that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been providing financial support to Solidarity Polish authorities also believe that the West has been too slow in extending credits that would enable <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> to overcome its economic problems, which include a $ 40 billion foreign debt, the largest in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Olechowski </PERSON>'s visit was his first trip outside <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> since he became foreign minister several weeks ago. It occurred a day after <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Karoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> met with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> during an official visit. <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>'s visit also was seen as a breakthrough because no Hungarian leader of that rank had visited <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> since <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> became communist 40 years ago. Both <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> are members of the Soviet-led <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION>. Asked why he was visiting <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> instead of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on his first foreign trip, <PERSON> Olechowski </PERSON> said the visit had been planned by his predecessor, <PERSON> Marian </PERSON> <PERSON> Orzechowski </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 The price of imported goods, one of the main inflationary yardsticks in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy, rose 2.7 percent in the April-June quarter, the largest increase in more than a year, the government reported Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the second quarter rise followed a 1.2 percent increase in the January-March period and was the steepest since the 4.1 percent jump in the first three months of 1987, which was attributed almost entirely to rising crude oil prices. Higher oil prices were also a significant contributor to the second quarter gain this year. Imported fuel and related products jumped 6.7 percent from the first quarter. However, over the past year, they were down 12.7 percent. Excluding the effects of the jump in imported oil, second quarter prices rose 2.3 percent, in line with the average quarterly increase over the last three years. Sharp rises in metals and natural rubber led the climb. Iron and steel prices soared 35 percent in the second quarter, while other metals rose 16.5 percent. The price of imported nickel, a key ingredient in steel manufacturing, shot up 55.8 percent for the quarter and more than doubled in price over the past year. The price of natural rubber climbed 32.8 percent for the quarter and was up 60 percent from a year ago. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Alterman </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> analyst, said the worldwide acquired immune deficiency syndrome epidemic is driving up natural rubber prices by increasing the demand for condoms and rubber gloves. For the past year, import prices were up 6.3 percent. That compares with a 4.4 percent annual rate of inflation in overall consumer prices since the beginning of 1987. The fall of the dollar from highs in early 1985, while improving the price competitiveness of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goods overseas and helping to lower the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit, also has the effect of boosting the price of foreign goods in American markets. However, according to the report, the dollar played a substantially smaller role in driving up import prices than in previous quarters. The dollar declined in value against foreign currencies by only 0.2 percent in the second quarter, compared with drops of 1.1 percent in the first quarter and 5.8 percent in last three months of 1987. In recent weeks, the value of the dollar has been rising. On the export side, prices of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goods sold overseas also rose 2.7 percent, the largest increase since the government began tracking the figures in September 1983. Rising metal costs, as well as the first drought-caused jumps in grain prices, were responsible for much of the export rise in the second quarter. The price of exported grain was up 9.3 percent in the April-June period, led by a 30.1 percent hike in wheat prices. Iron and steel prices rose 4.4 percent while other metals were up 7.2 percent.

 Teen-agers who spent two weeks with <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> families said they are happy they went, but glad to get home to food they can identify and parents who let them go places on their own. `` I enjoyed visiting and they're ready to have me and my whole family back, but I do n't know if I'd want to live there,'' said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON>, 17. `` I guess because it's so different and I'm used to everything here.

She gave me tons and tons of big coffee table books about the state of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. `` My Georgian grandmother came downstairs one day _ she did n't speak any English _ and gave me a ring off her finger,'' she said `` I'm sure it's a family heirloom. I'm totally scared I'm going to lose it. <PERSON> Heather </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON>, 17, said the only money she spent was on a chocolate ice cream cone in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. `` It was the only thing I put in my mouth that I knew what it would taste like,'' she said. `` I think I ate stuffed eggplant every single night. It was n't very good. I ca n't tell you what the food was because it was completely different.'' Miss <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON> said she got along well with her 13-year-old host, <PERSON> Maia </PERSON> <PERSON> Tsintsadze </PERSON>. `` It was this little girl's dream to come to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and she treated me with a lot of respect,'' she said. Miss <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON> said she was n't impressed with the clothing styles in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, but neither was her host. `` Their clothes were kind of old fashioned,'' she said. `` Not hoop skirts, not that old. It was n't trendy like our clothes. We'd go shopping and she'd say, ` You do n't want to go to our clothes stores They're ugly. Even we do n't like them.''' <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Bird </PERSON>, 16, said he cherished the few opportunities he had to meet people on his own. `` Although <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> is supposed to be a classless society, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> has a very strict class system and our hosts were the creme de la creme of Georgian society,'' he said. `` We did n't get to mix much with the lower classes.'' On one visit to a nearby small town, <PERSON> Bird </PERSON> said, `` people in the street starting gravitating toward us, so we started giving out our cards and some trinkets and sticks of gum.'' `` I felt great that the people from this place who were supposedly our enemies were so loving and kind to us,'' he said. `` They followed us around. The kids were shy, but they were giving me these things out of the blue because I was there and I was American.''

 A Canadian jetliner with 246 passengers aboard had to climb sharply to avoid colliding with Soviet military planes that were intercepted by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Canadian fighters over the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>, officials said Thursday. `` It was a fairly close call,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> Pascoe </PERSON>. The incident happened Wednesday at 12:40 p.m. EDT about 250 miles off the coast of <LOCATION> Newfoundland </LOCATION> and involved a Worldways <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> DC-8 airliner, said Worldways Vice President <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Doucette </PERSON>. He said the passenger jet was flying from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Gatwick </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Doucette </PERSON> said the pilot reported seeing two Soviet planes and two fighters within 500 to 1,000 feet of his flight path. He `` pulled up and pulled right'' to avoid collision, <PERSON> Doucette </PERSON> said. No one was hurt and the plane landed safely at <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION>. The DC-8 was cruising at 31,000 feet and had no warning of military traffic in the area, <PERSON> Doucette </PERSON> said. Capt. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> F-15 fighters based in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> and two Canadian CF-18 fighters from <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> had been sent to intercept two Soviet Bear-H reconnaissance aircraft in what he termed a `` normal intercept.'' The Soviet planes were in international airspace, but <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Canadian jets intercept Soviet aircraft that close to the coast `` to let them know we know they're there.'' It was the 16th intercept this year. He said it was up to civilian air traffic control to inform the DC-8 of any military traffic in the area. The Canadian <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> was expected to investigate why there was an apparent breakdown in communications.

 A witness testified Thursday that <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s older brother bragged in a West German bar shortly after a 1985 <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> hijacking that <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> was involved in seizing the jetliner. Another acquaintance of <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> testified that the defendant was `` crazy about <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'' -LRB- <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s revolutionary patriarch -RRB-, and a third said <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> admitted belonging to <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, the pro-Iranian radical Shiite Moslem group linked to kidnappings in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> is accused of being one of the hijackers of <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> flight 847, which was seized on June 14, 1985 and diverted to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The gunmen killed <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> and held 39 Americans hostage for 17 days. A West German court convicted <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s older brother, <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON>, in April of kidnapping two West Germans in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in an attempt to force <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to free <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gaazi </PERSON> <PERSON> Yazbeck </PERSON>, a Lebanese man who lives in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and knows the two <LOCATION> Hamadis </LOCATION>, was asked in court if <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> ever mentioned the hijacking to him. `` No, <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> said nothing. But his brother, <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> had something to do with the hijacking,'' <PERSON> Yazbeck </PERSON> replied. `` He just said it, he was sort of bragging.'' <PERSON> Yazbeck </PERSON> said the conversation occurred `` a few weeks after the airplane was hijacked'' at a bar in <LOCATION> Saarland </LOCATION> state, where <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> was then living. Another witness, <PERSON> Elfriede </PERSON> <PERSON> Akcura </PERSON>, said she befriended <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> while he lived in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> from 1982-1984 and they frequently discussed religion. `` He was crazy about <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>,'' she said. `` He is a <LOCATION> Khomeini </LOCATION> follower.'' Witness <PERSON> Reinhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmid </PERSON>, who shared a cell with <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> for six months in 1987, said that at one point <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> admitted to being a member of <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Schmid </PERSON>, who was in prison for a drug offense but is now free, said he asked <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> what <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>'s goals were and quoted <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> as replying, `` The goal of the <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> is to wipe out the Zionists even if it takes generations.'' He said <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> told him <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>'s enemies were <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, `` <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and those supported by the Americans.'' <PERSON> Schmid </PERSON> told the court that during their conversations <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> insisted he had nothing to do with the hijacking.

 Elderly small-town <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> blues singers are being tapped as historians by a new <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> series in which they share their memories and music to help young blacks understand their rural roots. `` Blues is not entertainment only,'' said <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Liniger </PERSON>, whose 10 interviews with local blues lovers are woven together in the oral history and music series, `` The Original Down Home Blues Show.'' `` Blues players have often been compared to the ` griot' in the African tribal system. The ` griot' was the storyteller, singer and historian of the tribe,'' <PERSON> Liniger </PERSON> said. `` In a sense the blues player once had a similar function: He-she processed and voiced in his-her own way the emotional undertows of the black community,'' said <PERSON> Liniger </PERSON> of the Blues Archive at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION>. Syndicated by <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> in January, the program already has aired on 12 stations around the country, said <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Koon </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Productions </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, which covered the project's $ 23,000 and provided technical assistance. Thirty-four other stations are scheduled to begin broadcasting the series soon, <PERSON> Koon </PERSON> said. His company, based in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, is negotiating with an underwriter to fund additional interviews with aging blues men and women. <PERSON> Liniger </PERSON>, a Swiss-born musician, said he did n't interview any well-known musicians. He was interested in the everyday men and women, ages 60 to 80, from the rural <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>. `` If you go back to the early part of this century where the idiom of blues begins to sort of take shape, then the -LRB- blues -RRB- records or people's memories are the only thing we have to document a certain aspect of the black experience in this country,'' <PERSON> Liniger </PERSON> said. `` I do believe that even if we read black intellectuals of the time, they were concerned with other topics than the rural South. They were much more concerned with the black experience in urban settings. `` The feeling I got from talking with a lot of older black people is they are living in a social context that is not documented either by blacks or whites.'' Each program in the series features an interview with a single musician. The musicians do n't always perform, but sometimes choose from the Archive's selection songs that they enjoyed in younger years. <PERSON> Liniger </PERSON> then talks with them about what life was like when that song was popular _ exploring the educational, social, religious and moral aspects of the day. For example, 70-year-old <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferies </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Holly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> describes in one program her grade school memories. `` I went to the ` rag school,' to the ` bush hollow' ... just some posts nailed in the ground with some limbs and things cut off of trees and piled up around ` em and also over the top of it the same way. And that's what we went to school in _ the <PERSON> bush </PERSON> hollow. We toted our water from the spring down at the bottom of the hill,'' she says. About 10 children would gather at the <PERSON> bush </PERSON> hollow for class _ unless they were needed in the fields or elsewhere to help the family get by, <ORGANIZATION> Jefferies </ORGANIZATION> said. Many rural black women of her day did n't have the luxury of a doctor's or hospital's care when their children were born, she said. `` I never went to no hospital. I had my children myself,'' <PERSON> Jefferies </PERSON> recalls. `` I had a midwife to come see me once or twice. But whenever they'd get there my childrens was born. I ai n't lying. I had my childrens my own self. Me and the good Lord together, I say it like that.'' Five of her seven children died, <PERSON> Jefferies </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jefferies </PERSON> said she's particularly proud of her son who lives in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> _ a much different world than her <LOCATION> Holly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Liniger </PERSON> said he hopes the radio program's use of blues tunes as historical benchmarkers will help the children of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and other urban areas better understand the lives of their grandparents. In another interview, <PERSON> Liniger </PERSON> asked 76-year-old <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> `` Cotton'' <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Holly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>: `` What does the blues offer you today?'' <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> replied: `` It helps me along. It brings up stories and memories with my friends. We'd be sittin' and talkin', you know. Ai n't that many left.''

<HEAD>Senators Offer Plan to Combat Greenhouse Effect</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Sixteen senators, including the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> chairman, unveiled a comprehensive plan Thursday to combat the global overheating that scientists say threatens the planet in the 21st Century. Their legislation, with proposals ranging from developing safer nuclear power to minimizing destruction of Third World forests, represents the broadest <ORGANIZATION> Capitol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hill </ORGANIZATION> response yet to warnings from scientists about the so-called greenhouse effect. `` The greenhouse effect is the most significant economic, political, environmental and human problem facing the 21st Century,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wirth </PERSON>, D-Colo., the principal author of package Joining him at a news conference was <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-La </LOCATION>., the energy chairman who has over the years been identified more with energy development and production than with environmental protection <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, who recently held a hearing on the greenhouse effect, said that `` the evidence of global warming is virtually undeniable. It is so much more comprehensive, dangerous and life-changing than anything we've ever seen.'' Aides said that <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> has become convinced that global action is necessary to combat the production of carbon and other greenhouse gases that scientists say trap heat in the atmosphere, threatening major changes in climate and higher ocean levels. <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, who said he would hold more hearings in coming weeks, stopped short of endorsing a key element of <PERSON> Wirth </PERSON>'s proposal: requiring new car fleets to average 55 miles per gallon by 2010, or double the 1985 fuel efficiency standard. The legislation would force this country to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 20 percent by 2000. Scientists estimate that carbon dioxide, coming mostly from fossil fuel combustion, produces about half the greenhouse effect. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is said to be responsible for 20 percent of the world's carbon dioxide emissions. The proposal would require administration officials to draft a national energy plan emphasizing least-cost ways of reducing fossil fuel use and increasing use of renewables such as solar energy. The package would authorize about $ 1 billion through 1992 for research and development of non-fossil energy sources and a new generation of safer and cheaper nuclear reactors. It also calls for greater reliance on cleaner-burning natural gas for heating and transportation. On the international front, the secretary of state would be urged to hold an international meeting aimed at getting other nations to commit to a 50 percent cut in greenhouse gas production by 2015. The legislation would authorize this country to spend more than $ 1.5 billion in the early 1990s to provide birth control information in an effort to slow the demand for fossil fuels in burgeoning nations. It also calls for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to work through international lending and development agencies to slow the destruction of forests, which consume carbon dioxide when alive but which emit huge amounts when they are cut down. <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> said that to slow pollution in the Third World, `` we're going to have to pay for their non-development in some way, and it's going to be expensive. He said that in 1989, `` we'll have to begin the serious process of legislating. We'll act as fast as the public's willing to support us.'' <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> said that economic interests like automakers and coal producers `` must understand that this is not a passing fad, that it's not going to go away. This will not change with administrations. It's not a Democratic-Republican issue. It's not a liberal-conservative issue. And I'm not sure we can solve it.'' Joining as cosponsors were <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Baucus </PERSON>, D-Mont.; <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Bingaman </PERSON>, D-N.M.; <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Bumpers </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ark </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Chafee </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-R.I. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON>, R-Mo.; Wyche <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON>, D-Ga.; <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, D-Tenn.; <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON>, R-Pa.; <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Hawaii </LOCATION>; <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Melcher </PERSON>; <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Spark </PERSON> <PERSON> Matsunaga </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Hawaii </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanford </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.C. </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stafford </PERSON>, R-Vt. The package was introduced a day after <PERSON> Stafford </PERSON>, <PERSON> Baucus </PERSON>, <PERSON> Chaffee </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Minn </LOCATION>., submitted legislation to end all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> production and use of chlorofluorocarbons by 1999 These chemicals contribute to global warming as well as destroying the ozone layer that shields the Earth from the sun's cancer-causing ultraviolet rays. Their bill would also force power plants to reduce emissions of the pollutants that cause acid rain and require new homes to contain the most efficient heating and cooling systems available.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> passed 368-29 on Thursday a $ 5.8 billion relief package for drought-stricken farmers after scaling back a heavily debated price-support increase for the dairy industry. `` Hold on,'' <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman E. `` Kika'' de la <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, declared as the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved the measure. `` Help is coming in a sensible, rational, compassionate way.'' Approval came after dairy-state lawmakers responded to a drumroll of criticism by compromising on a plan to increase the price-support level for milk. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> adopted 217-181 a scaled-back version that still would leave the cost of the benefit above the $ 100 million level. `` This offers stability for our dairy farmers,'' Rep. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Gunderson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Wis </LOCATION>., declared as the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved his plan to impose a 50-cent increase in the milk price-support level, but only for three months The action resolved the most heavily debated issue in the House version of the drought aid package. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> was expected to rush the measure through with equal dispatch, possibly before the night was out. Both <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> were working on highly similar versions of the bill with an eye toward putting the bill before the president at least by Aug. 11, when lawmakers are set to flee <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s summer heat `` This bill is the most generous disaster relief package ever considered by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>,'' <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, D-Vt., said as debate began in that chamber At the core of both bills is a provision that would pay drought-stricken farmers 65 percent of lost earnings from crop damage in excess of 35 percent of the harvest expected before blazing sun and a shortage of rainfall hammered the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. Key provisions also would streamline and expand government programs to aid livestock and dairy producers forced to pay escalating feed costs because the drought has burned away a substantial quantity of hay and feedgrains. <PERSON> Gunderson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Penny </PERSON> offered their plan to scale back the dairy provision after the original version came under criticism from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration as excessively costly. Sponsored by Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeffords </PERSON>, R-Vt., the original version would have imposed an increase in the dairy price support level of 50 cents on Oct. 1 to $ 11.10 for each 100 pounds of milk That would cost consumers, at most, a few cents per gallon in increased milk prices. Dairy-state lawmakers said the cost to the government would be $ 145 million, while <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> said in a letter to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman E. `` Kika'' de la <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, on Wednesday night that the actual cost would be $ 300 million. Lawmakers said that the <LOCATION> Gunderson-Penny </LOCATION> plan, limiting the increase to a three-month period from April through June next year, would reduce costs by perhaps $ 30 million. Dairy-state lawmakers have been saying that the increase is warranted to avert a milk shortage looming over the country next spring and because milk producers have faced greater feed costs while not receiving the disaster payments that the bill allocates for crop producers. But the increase has come under fire not only from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration but from an array of business groups and even farm organizations that most often ally themselves with dairymen in matters involving farm-subsidy legislation. `` This is a most dangerous and wrongheaded precedent,'' Rep. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Kan </LOCATION>., told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in urging it to slash any price-support increase from the legislation `` Should those in the cattle business, in the sheep and the poultry business, be asked to pay the same high feed costs without some similar subsidy _ that's not fair. Before taking up the dairy issue, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved an amendment sponsored by de la <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> that would bring the estimate cost to $ 5.8 billion. When the measure came to the floor, the price tag was placed at $ 6.9 billion by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> staff. The reason was because of a provision that would have required the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to pay half of the cost of reseeding and other seeding of drought-burned pastures in 20 states. The measure sponsored by Rep. <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, D-Ala., was harnessed to the bill when the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> was racing to wrap up work and later estimated to have a $ 1.2 billion cost <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>'s amendment reduced the overall cost of the bill by shrinking the seeding provision. Even then, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, acknowledged Thursday morning that there was no way to be perfectly sure of exactly how much the drought bill would cost. Farm lawmakers have been saying that fiscal watchdogs worried about the spending level have nothing to complain about because it would be less than federal savings realized because of the drought. But <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said there was no certainty. `` The art of economics is not a precise one,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said.

 Top Soviet and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> officials will meet in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> starting Sunday to exchange views on the prospects for a negotiated withdrawal of all foreign forces from southwestern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON> will lead the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation and Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamyshin </PERSON> will head the Soviet side. The two days of talks will take place on the eve of a new round of negotiations aimed at achieving the withdrawal of foreign forces from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and Namibian independence from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The negotiations, also set for <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, involve <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> playing a mediating role. The talks will be held from Aug. 2-4 with <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON> representing the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He has spent seven years attempting to arrange a settlement but, with five armies involved in the conflict and the negotiations plagued by mutual distrust among the participants, the task has not been easy. During the last round of talks, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> reached agreement on a statement of principles governing future negotiations. The next round is expected to include discussions on a timetable for the withdrawal of the estimated 50,000 Cuban forces from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, where <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> also has several thousand troops deployed in support of a U.S.-backed rebel group. The Soviets also play a key role in the conflict because of their extensive military support for <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s Marxist government. In the talks starting Sunday, <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON> is expected ask <PERSON> Adamyshin </PERSON> about <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> willingness to encourage a final settlement. In discussions over the past year, the Soviets have indicated a positive attitude toward the negotiations and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> has been sending out similar signals. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> also said <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Adamyshin </PERSON> also will discuss the situation in the <LOCATION> Horn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, where there has been continued civil strife in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, insisting on anonymity, said the Soviet-backed government in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> has been supporting insurgents in both the <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 A state law signed Thursday requires most residents to separate their trash within three years, making <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> the largest state with a mandatory recycling program. In a brief ceremony in the rose garden at the Executive Mansion, Gov. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> signed the trash bill before a handful of lawmakers and several representatives of groups who had worked for the bill's passage. The law mandates that 407 communities with 7.8 million people establish the recycling plans to help cope with a growing trash problem and dwindling landfill space. `` All over our state and all over our nation it's as plain as the eye can see or the nose can smell that we have to change our ways,'' <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> said. The state's remaining 77 landfills have a combined capacity of only three to five years, he said. Pennsylvanians each year generate nine million tons of trash, 95 percent of which goes into landfills, <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> said. Only 1 percent of the state's trash is recycled. `` Whether it floats up on beaches or seeps out of landfills, we can see that our garbage does not disappear,'' <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> said. The governor said the recycling program would reduce the state's volume of solid waste by 25 percent by 1997 Under the law, municipalities with more than 10,000 residents must set up curbside recycling programs within two years and those with 5,000 or more face a three-year deadline. Counties will choose three of eight materials to recycle including glass, colored glass, aluminum, steel and bimetallic cans, high-grade office paper, newsprint, corrugated paper and plastics. All communities must recycle leaf waste.

 The most comprehensive banking bill since the <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Depression </ORGANIZATION> cleared a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee Thursday after 16 -LCB- grueling hours of debate, but it faces an uncertain future with little time left in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' legislative year. The bill, approved by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on a 30-20 vote, grants banks broad new securities powers but restricts their ability to enter real estate and insurance and imposes new obligations on them to serve the poor. The bill now is headed for the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, where the chairman, Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mich </LOCATION>., is known to be skeptical of letting banks into the securities business Depending on how long House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, allows for <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>'s review, the powerful <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Democrat could kill the bill through delay or exact concessions by threatening delay. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is preparing to leave town for its summer recess on Aug. 12 and wo n't be back until Sept. 6. Then, it plans only a month-long session before adjourning for the fall election campaign. `` There's a real question whether this bill is going to pass the House. It's a very controversial bill and there just is n't much time,'' said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Yingling </PERSON>, chief lobbyist for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the industry's largest trade group. Aides to <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> has not yet decided on a deadline for the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, but they indicated that <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON> is not inclined to act quickly. The Banking Committee, after a session that began 10 a.m. Wednesday and ended 2:30 a.m. Thursday with only short breaks, approved the measure with all but three Democrats in favor and all but three Republicans opposed. The hodgepodge of compromises struck to get it through has created some odd political coalitions. The banking industry and the securities industry, normally bitter opponents, are both opposing it for different reasons. Consumer groups are supporting it, along with the real estate and insurance industries. But, the alignment could change _ with banks on one side and all of the other groups on the other _ if <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, as expected, tightens the restrictions on how banks are permitted to exercise the new securities activities. `` The likelihood of the bill being improved by the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> is very small,'' <PERSON> Yingling </PERSON> said. Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, D-Mass., whose Energy and <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on finance gets first crack at the securities provisions, said Thursday his panel needed to make `` major changes'' in the bill `` There simply are not adequate safeguards for the banking system,'' he said. The bill would, if enacted, represent the first crack in the barrier between investment and commercial banking that was erected as part of the reforms stemming from the 1929 stock market crash. It allows bank holding companies to underwrite virtually every type of security except corporate stock. The securities industry had unsuccessfully sought to keep underwriting of corporate bonds, mutual funds and corporate debt convertible to stock away from banks. But, the House bill includes those powers as well as the underwriting of commercial paper, municipal revenue bonds and securities backed by mortgages and other consumer debt such as auto loans. Other sections require banks: _ To serve poor people by providing low-cost `` lifeline'' checking services for accounts between $ 25 and $ 1,000 _ To offer special accounts for the cashing of government checks such as Social Security and welfare checks, with a cashing charge of no more than $ 2 _ To have a good record of serving poor communities in their lending area before getting permission from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> to exercise new powers _ To cease further expansion into the real estate business for two years _ To stay out of insurance underwriting and to limit the number of additional institutions that can sell insurance underwritten by other companies The chairman of the banking committee, Rep. <PERSON> Fernand </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> St </PERSON> <PERSON> Germain </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, in a statement Thursday, hailed the bill as `` a major step forward in providing a sane restructuring of the financial industry and establishing a solid framework of protections for consumers.'' Republican opposition to the consumer sections had threatened committee passage of the bill until an hour-long negotiating session behind closed doors after midnight. Democrats agreed to accept some watering down of the consumer provisions and, in exchange, three Republicans _ <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hiler </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridge </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> _ voted in favor of the bill. Rep. <PERSON> Chalmers </PERSON> <PERSON> Wylie </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, the ranking Republican on the committee, had argued that the consumer provisions would, in effect, give the federal government the power to allocate credit. Also, because of their expense, they could impair the soundness of the banking system, he said.

 <PERSON> Cher </PERSON> and her boyfriend angrily denied Thursday that he tried to run down a photographer with her sports car, blaming the resulting crash on frustration with being constantly dogged by the media. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Camilletti </PERSON>, live-in boyfriend of the singer-turned-actress, told reporters he lost control of the car while swerving into the driveway of <PERSON> Cher </PERSON>'s home in hopes of ducking photographers camped outside. `` I never had any intention of ever hurting anyone at any time,'' he said. The wreck outside <PERSON> Cher </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Benedict </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canyon </LOCATION> home Wednesday heavily damaged <PERSON> Cher </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Ferrari </ORGANIZATION> and the photographer's car, but no one was injured. <PERSON> Camilletti </PERSON> was arrested and booked for investigation of felony assualt with a deadly weapon on free-lance photographer <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Brandt </PERSON>, 35. No charges have been filed. `` He tried to kill me. He tried to run me over at a high rate of speed,'' <PERSON> Brandt </PERSON> said after the incident. `` I was within my rights. I would never do anything illegal.'' <PERSON> Cher </PERSON>, 42, and <PERSON> Camilletti </PERSON>, 24, have been companions since meeting at a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> nightclub on her 40th birthday. A former <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> bagel maker, pizza chef and bartender, <PERSON> Camilletti </PERSON> is pursuing an acting career and recently completed shooting of `` Loverboy'' with <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kirstie </PERSON> <PERSON> Alley </PERSON>. At a news conference closed to most free-lance photographers and representatives of the tabloid press, the couple discussed a litany of grievances stemming from the spotlight on their relationship. <PERSON> Cher </PERSON>, known for her revealing costumes, wore black pants, tunic and jacket. <PERSON> Cher </PERSON> directed most of her anger at the tabloid press, but said inaccurate stories about her had also been carried by the media in general. `` I know that I have to give up lots of my rights, that people can write in a magazine that I, you know, do n't have my rib cage, or that this is not my chin, or these are not my cheeks,'' she said. Since <PERSON> Cher </PERSON> won an Academy Award for her role in the movie `` Moonstruck,'' various publications have reported that the couple is due to marry, that she is pregnant, which she denied, and that she has undergone drastic plastic surgery to maintain her willowy figure and high cheek bones, she said. `` I've been doing this for 25 years, and so I'm pretty much used to having my private life destroyed and lies told about me,'' said <PERSON> Cher </PERSON>, who began her public career in the 1960s as half of the husband-wife duo <ORGANIZATION> Sonny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Cher </PERSON>. `` It's something that you pretty much have to get used to. After a while it really bothers you and disrupts your family life. ... I'm usually pretty good about it. I'm getting really, really angry,'' she said. <PERSON> Cher </PERSON> said she did n't believe her boyfriend was capable of intentionally hurting anyone. `` I know <PERSON> Robert </PERSON>. He is not a violent man. This is not <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Penn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Cher </PERSON> said, referring to the pugnacious actor who's had a number of well-publicized run-ins with photographers She hastened to add that <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION> is `` the sweetest boy I've ever known'' and that his outbursts were also triggered by intense media scrutiny. The couple refused to talk about possible legal action against the photographer, whom they claimed was harassing them, and they left the news conference without addressing media reports that marriage was imminent. In a statement prepared by the couple's lawyer, <PERSON> Camilletti </PERSON> called the crash the culmination of weeks of frustration. When <PERSON> Brandt </PERSON> and another photographer stepped into the road to photograph Camilletti, he said he swerved toward the driveway, the brakes of the Ferrari locked and the car slid into <PERSON> Brandt </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Camilletti </PERSON> acknowledged that he smashed <PERSON> Brandt </PERSON>'s camera in frustration after the two photographers fled. <PERSON> Camiletti </PERSON> was released on $ 2,000 bond.

While they rode the White House elevator to the East Room to meet the press, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> told <PERSON> Fortas </PERSON> that in a few minutes he would be announced as the nominee to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. Four years after he joined the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Fortas </PERSON> resigned for accepting a $ 20,000-a-year salary to work for a foundation set up by millionaire industrialist <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfson </PERSON> while he was a member of the court. <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> justices made $ 39,500 at the time.

 Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has called more than a dozen prospective running mates, aides said Thursday, while <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> himself said merely that his selection effort has been orderly and that public speculation is inevitable. Widening the list of prospects, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and aides have been in contact several times this week with Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, R-Ind., whose name did not figure in earlier speculation <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Nesbit </PERSON> said that the vice president had called <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> on Monday, and that the call was followed up by a visit to <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s office on Tuesday by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kimmitt </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lawyer who is overseeing the screening process of potential candidates. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aides further contacted <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> on Thursday, <PERSON> Nesbit </PERSON> said. `` He would accept it if asked,'' <PERSON> Nesbit </PERSON> said. Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.M. </LOCATION>, also confirmed on Thursday that he had been approached by the vice president, saying he was proud and honored to be on the list. `` I know it will be a difficult decision for the vice president to make,'' he said in a statement. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who says he will not make his final choice until the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> next month, has now all but completed calls to prospective candidates on his so-called `` long list,'' said an aide who spoke only on the condition of anonymity. `` He's only talking to people he's considering,'' said the aide. `` I would suspect that process is complete,'' the aide said. `` That does n't preclude some new calls tomorrow or the next day. The process is fluid and he's controlling it.'' Campaign sources said the vice president had earlier placed similar calls to _ or contacted personally _ his strongest primary-campaign rival, Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kans.; <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s wife, former <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, and Sens. <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON>, <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Wyo </LOCATION>., <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Colo </LOCATION>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON>, R-Mo., and <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kassebaum </PERSON>, Also already contacted, the sources said, were Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, Governors <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, and former Governors <PERSON> Lamar </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburg </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, who recently was nominated by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to be attorney general One on the list, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, was n't acknowledging his call, at least publicly. He joked that he and his wife had been `` waiting for the phone to ring at home. I ca n't get <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> to leave the house.'' Speaking at a fund-raising breakfast, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> minority leader joked that he hoped <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s choice of a running mate would be narrowed to just him and his wife, `` and I drop out.'' However, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> himself told reporters last week that <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> would be on `` any list'' of potential running mates. Calls from the vice president were an early stage of the selection process. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had said he hoped to have a tentative list completed by week's end. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kimmitt </PERSON> is overseeing the screening process, including the distribution of questionnaires seeking financial and personal background information from prospective candidates. The vice president told reporters outside his <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> office on Thursday that speculation over his running mate was inevitable. `` You ca n't avoid speculation,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` The process is going along in an orderly fashion. Hopefully, it wo n't be demeaning to anyone,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who had no public events scheduled on Thursday, was to visit a child-care center Friday morning in a northern <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` He wanted to follow up on his child-care initiative,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spokeswoman <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Sunday proposed a $ 1,000 tax credit for child care primarily aimed at low-income working mothers. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign manager <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> said that recent polls showing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> trailing <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> by as much as 18 points coming out of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> had been expected. `` I figured it could go up to 20 points,'' <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> said in an interview. `` Polls right after a convention do n't mean anything.'' `` As <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> said in l984, ` Where's the beef?''' <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> said, referring to the 1984 Democratic presidential candidate's use of a fast-food advertising slogan to refer to then-rival <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> primary theme of `` new ideas.'' `` There's no substance whatsoever in <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' campaign,'' <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> said. `` We're going to point out over and over again that <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign is one of issues and substance.''

<TEXT>
 Here, at a glance, are the key provisions of far-reaching bank deregulation legislation approved, 30-20, Thursday by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Banking Committee:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>SECURITIES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 The bill grants bank holding companies the power, through separately capitalized subsidiaries, to underwrite corporate bonds, mutual funds, commerical paper, corporate debt convertible to stock and securities backed by mortgages and other consumer loans. A bank would not have to form a holding company to underwrite municipal bonds or to sell shares in a mutual fund underwritten by another company. Securities firms retain exclusive rights to the biggest area of securities underwriting: corporate stock.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>SAFEGUARDS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Affiliated banks and securities firms are barred from sharing the same name, logo, advertising or premises. The securities subsidiary will be required to inform customers they are not dealing with a federally insured bank.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>INSURANCE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 The legislation limits banks' ability to expand into insurance. National banks and state-chartered banks owned by holding companies, which are regulated on the federal level, will not be allowed to underwrite insurance, unless they already do so. Free-standing state banks remain governed by state laws. If state law permits, state banks will be allowed to sell insurance, unless they are owned by an out-of-state holding company. There is an exemption for national banks serving communities of 5,000 population and less.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>REAL ESTATE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 National banks and state banks owned by a holding company will be banned for two years from entering the real estate business. Banks currently engaged in real estate activies may continue.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>CONSUMERS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Banks will be required to demonstrate a good record of lending to poor neighborhoods before receiving <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> permission to engage in new powers. Agricultural banks with assets of less than $ 50 million and all commercial banks with assets less than $ 25 million are exempted Banks will also be required to offer low-fee, low-service `` lifeline'' checking accounts to poor customers. They can be opened for as little as $ 25 and can have a balance as high as $ 1,000. However, customers will have to pay extra to write more than 10 checks per month. Special checking accounts must be offered to poor people who only want to cash government checks up to $ 1,500 such as Social Security and welfare payments. No more than $ 2 may be charged per check for the cashing service.

<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official made the first disclosure of the location of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> production facilities for chemical weapons in an attempt Thursday to speed talks aimed at banning the manufacture and use of such weapons. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, an <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said chemical weapons were being produced or stored at only two of the five sites named by <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedersdorf </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegate to the 40-nation Conference on Disarmament. <PERSON> Friedersdorf </PERSON> told the conference his announcement was an unprecedented step toward greater openness. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> previously declared the location of its stockpiles and the types of chemicals contained in them, but not the amount or the location of the production facilities. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has declared the amount of its stockpiles, but not their location, nor the location of production sites. <PERSON> Friedersdorf </PERSON> said his delegation hoped the declaration would `` contribute both to greater confidence and to the negotiation of related provisions'' of a convention banning the production, stockpiling and use of chemical weapons. The <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> conference has been negotiating such a convention for 20 years. This year's summer session began July 7. `` The declaration we are making today is unprecedented,'' <PERSON> Friedersdorf </PERSON> said, adding that no other conference member had provided information on chemical weapons production facilities. `` We urge other countries that possess chemical weapons production facilities to declare the locations of their facilities and to outline how the facilities would be destroyed,'' he said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> are the only two members of the conference who have acknowledged possessing chemical weapons. Many conference members have declared that they do not possess chemical weapons, but <PERSON> Friedersdorf </PERSON> indicated in his speech that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> does not believe some of them. He declined to say which countries. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has said previously it believes about 15 nations possess such weapons, but it consistently declines to identify them. In December, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> said its chemical weapon stocks total 50,000 tons, but Western experts have estimated the total is much higher. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> also said it had no stocks outside its borders, a contention that also has been challenged by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The production facilities declared by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are <ORGANIZATION> Rocky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arsenal </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>; the <ORGANIZATION> Pine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bluff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arsenal </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, which produces the new binary chemical weapons; <ORGANIZATION> Muscle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shoals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Newport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ammunition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Depot </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>; and <ORGANIZATION> Aberdeen </ORGANIZATION> Proving Ground in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>. At the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, Lt. Col. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapla </PERSON> said chemical weapons currently are produced or stored only at Pine Bluff and Muscle Shoals. `` These are locations which are at present or were at one time involved in the production of chemical weapons,'' <PERSON> Chapla </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Friedersdorf </PERSON>'s list. `` At <LOCATION> Rocky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION>, there is no chemical weapon production, testing or storage going on.'' <PERSON> Chapla </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Aberdeen </ORGANIZATION> is used to test some components of the current generation of chemical weapons but is not used to produce, store or test the binary, or dual chemical, weapons the military now uses. `` Our focus now is the production of binary chemical, principally at Pine Bluff,'' he said. Some work is also done at Muscle Shoals on one of the chemicals used in binary weapons but the weapon is not deadly until the two chemicals are combined, <PERSON> Chapla </PERSON> said. `` The binary program is such that you never have a complete weapon stored in any one place,'' he said. `` The two chemicals are never kept together and they will not be mated until just before firing.'' At the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> conference, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> also submitted to the conference ideas for methods to destroy chemical weapons under an eventual ban. Delegates have drafted many parts of a chemical weapons ban. The main unresolved issue is how to guard against cheating. Other problems include ensuring that the maximum number of countries joins the ban, maintaining a military balance while stocks are gradually destroyed, and precisely defining chemical weapons. <PERSON> Friedersdorf </PERSON> said in his speech that `` an agreed definition -LRB- of chemical weapons -RRB- is within reach'' and the conference has made `` significant progress'' toward resolving some issues in the past months. He did not elaborate.

 Democratic vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> told a union audience Thursday that the only time the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration cares about <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> workers is `` when they want to put 2 million of them on polygraph machines.'' Later Thursday, in a speech in <LOCATION> Reno </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> criticized <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration drug-fighting efforts. He also planned to visit <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Amarillo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, on his first solo campaign trip since being nominated last week in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> and Commercial Workers convention gave a noisy welcome to <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. Many of the 3,500 members in the audience were wearing `` I Like Mike'' T-shirts and waving union-prepared signs for presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. Earlier this year, the union was credited by lawmakers with helping with compromise language in legislation that barred most polygraph tests of job applicants by private businesses. Administration officials had opposed the separate versions passed by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, but President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> signed the compromise final version last spring. The congressional <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assessment </ORGANIZATION> has estimated that about 2 million polygraph tests are given each year, most of them by private businesses. Four years ago, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> received nearly half the votes of the traditionally Democratic members of the union, said spokesman <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Zack </PERSON>. But he released a poll _ taken prior to last week's Democratic National Convention _ showing the 1.1 million-member union was 2-to-1 in favor of the Democrats this year `` Those union members who were hoodwinked by <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> are coming home, in droves,'' said <ORGANIZATION> UFCW </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wynn </PERSON>. The convention was to hear from <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> later by satellite television hookup. After that, <PERSON> Wynn </PERSON> scheduled action on a resolution putting his union on record in favor of the ticket and requesting the parent <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> to make a formal endorsement. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> made the most of his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> record before the crowd, citing this year's fights with the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration over the trade bill and the sixty-days notice for plant closings. The <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator said administration officials have `` dragged their feet for eight years'' when action was needed to help American industry compete. `` Their indifference has cost <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> more than a million manufacturing jobs and caused trade deficits that will cripple growth,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. `` Sure, the Reagan-Bush administration occasionally pays attention to working men and women in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> _ like when they want to put 2 million of them on polygraph machines,'' he said. He said the Reagan-Bush record for women and minorities amounted to a `` speed bump on the path to equality in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' Later, in <PERSON> Reno </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> blasted the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration for `` chaos that exists in drug control.'' He told the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislators </ORGANIZATION> that `` our war against drugs lacks a commander.'' He said a Bentsen-Dukakis administration would appoint a single drug czar to oversee the battle. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' experience in state government gave him an affinity with local officials, and he said the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> would recognize the costs to state government when the federal government cuts back on its programs.

<TEXT>
 Investigators have blamed the fatal 1985 <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> bombing on <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON>'s terrorist group and found a possible <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> connection, a newspaper reported Thursday. The Frankfurter <ORGANIZATION> Neue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presse </ORGANIZATION> said a special commission of law enforcement officials had identified the attackers and authorities were seeking arrest warrants for <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> and three alleged accomplices. <PERSON> Hans-Juergen </PERSON> <PERSON> Foerster </PERSON>, spokesman for the chief federal prosecutor's office in <ORGANIZATION> Karlsruhe </ORGANIZATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> the commission had `` firmed up'' suspicions against <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> and his supporters but denied warrants were being sought. For more than three years, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> investigators have tried to pin down who planted the bomb that exploded in crowded passenger terminal at <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> on June 19, 1985, killing three people and wounding 42. They had expressed suspicion of the Palestinian terrorist group before. Foerster's office is represented on the commission and acts as its spokesman, but also is conducting its own inquiry. Hesse state officials established the commission a few months after the bombing. <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> is a former <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> school teacher and his real name is <PERSON> Sabry </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Banna </PERSON>. He is based in <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>. Israeli, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> and Western intelligence agencies have accused him of directing scores of terrorist attacks since he broke in 1976 with <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION>, the mainstream guerrilla faction led by <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> has been blamed for coordinated assaults at <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> airports Dec. 27, 1985, in which 20 people were killed. His group also was linked by Greek authorities to the terrorist attack July 11 on the City of <LOCATION> Poros </LOCATION> cruise ship, in which nine people were killed and 98 wounded. According to the newspaper, the West German panel also decided agents of Col. <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> leader, may have played a role in the attack. `` The investigations have shown that the <ORGANIZATION> Libyan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, as the embassy is called, had knowledge of the attack,'' it said. `` Whether it was involved in the preparation and execution still can not be proven.'' <PERSON> Foerster </PERSON> did not say when <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Rebmann </PERSON>, the chief federal prosecutor, might be ready to file criminal charges.

 Authorities have equipped <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s intelligence listening post with a system that works like a computer detective to ferret out software sabotage, the domestic news agency reported. <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said the new equipment will help avert sabotage by computer amateurs known as hackers and by enemies who use `` computer viruses,'' alien coding that insinuates itself into a system. The detecting system was installed at the Government Communications Headquarters in <LOCATION> Cheltenham </LOCATION>, about 110 miles northwest of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the agency reported. The listening facility sifts through radio and other airborne messages, seeking military and other secret communications. `` The nation's enemies have almost certainly tried to place damaging software within our systems,'' <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON> <PERSON> Soames </PERSON>, managing director of <ORGANIZATION> GPT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION>, was quoted as saying. His company developed the system. A computer virus is a small piece of code inserted into a system to corrupt data. It can infect other computers through networks or exchanged software, or can lie dormant until a pre-determined command activates it. `` One of the main concerns with the Strategic Defense Initiative in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is its vulnerability to viruses and logic bombs which would only trigger under war conditions,'' <PERSON> Soames </PERSON> was quoted as saying. The SDI space-defense project, commonly called `` Star Wars,'' program, would use computer-guided lasers to shoot down enemy missiles. <PERSON> Soames </PERSON> told the news agency several American companies have expressed interest in the detecting system.

 A federal drug agent testified Thursday he was told that a White House aide leaked details of one of the government's most sensitive cocaine investigations _ thus ending it prematurely _ in order to expose drug smuggling by the Nicaraguan government. <PERSON> Ernst </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON>, an undercover agent of the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, said that following the leak in July 1984, `` I heard from my superiors the leak came from an aide in the White House.'' While <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON> did not name the official, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Judiciary subcommittee on crime released pages from <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s diary showing the former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide made frequent references to the operation in the weeks before the leak. And the diary shows he was aware of photographs from the investigation showing cocaine being loaded at a Nicaraguan airstrip. A purported Nicaraguan government official who aided the smuggling operation was in the pictures. <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON>, testifying from behind a screen to hide his identity, also said that shortly before the leak, a <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> agent in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> told him the spy agency planned to leak the material to the news media to show Sandinista involvement in smuggling. The hearing was the first in a series by the crime subcommittee into whether <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration officials condoned drug smuggling and other criminal activities to further its Central American policy _ especially winning aid for the Contra rebels. The panel is particularly interested in whether administration officials obstructed law enforcement operations, as may have occurred in the 1984 nvestigation. Panel Chairman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, said a vote on aid to the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration-backed Contra rebels in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> was moving through <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> when the story was leaked on Sandinista drug smuggling. <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON> said the leak ended `` one of the most significant cocaine investigations in <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> history,'' which he said could have led to the arrest of the entire leadership of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s cocaine cartel. The cartel was operating inside <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> at the time, <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON> testified that convicted drug pilot <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Seal </PERSON> was working for the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> in the sting operation, and had made contact with the cartel and <PERSON> Federico </PERSON> <PERSON> Vaughn </PERSON>, whom <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON> described as a Nicaraguan interior ministry employee. However, the subcommittee also released information that cast doubt on <PERSON> Vaughn </PERSON>'s connection with the Nicaraguan government. <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> said the subcommittee staff recently called <PERSON> Vaughn </PERSON>'s number in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, and spoke to a `` domestic employee'' who said the house belonged to a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy employee The employee, who was not named, was among a group of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials expelled recently by <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist government, <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> said his investigators were told the house has been `` continuously rented'' by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since 1981. He later told reporters that <PERSON> Vaughn </PERSON>'s name never surfaced before the drup operation, `` and no one knew about him afterwards.'' <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON> said, `` To our knowledge, <PERSON> Federico </PERSON> <PERSON> Vaughn </PERSON> had no association with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> or anything related to the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. government.'' North's diary, however, had several references to `` <PERSON> Freddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Vaughn </PERSON>'' including a July 6 entry that said, `` Freddy coming in late July.'' In the undercover operation, Seal had flown to a <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> airstrip in a plane that had cameras installed by the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON> said. The agent said the pictures had been developed at <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> headquarters near <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and then `` taken to the White House.'' `` The <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> wanted to release them to the press, to show the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> were dealing in cocaine,'' <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON> said. The agent said <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> officials initially persuaded the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> to change its mind, but shortly afterwards, the story on the operation appeared in The <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Times. He said that story caused the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> to frantically make all the arrests possible at that point, but the operation was over. A second DEA official who testified after <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON> said he met with <PERSON> North </PERSON> about the operation before the news story was leaked, and the former <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> aide `` asked when the operation could go public.'' <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Caffrey </PERSON>, who was in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> cocaine desk at the time, said <PERSON> North </PERSON> `` did indicate to me there was a vote coming up on an appropriation bill to aid the Contras. I told him public disclosure would come from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney or the attorney general ... but we had a lot of goals left in the investigation.'' <PERSON> Caffrey </PERSON> added that <PERSON> North </PERSON> came up with a plan to use the investigation to aide the Contras. The agent said he told North that the chief <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> operative in the sting planned to fly $ 1.5 million into <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> to pay for drugs already brought back from that country. `` Colonel <PERSON> North </PERSON> asked why we could n't land the plane outside <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> and turn the money over to the Contras,'' <PERSON> Caffrey </PERSON> said, adding he told <PERSON> North </PERSON> that plan would jeopardize the operation. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Monastero </PERSON>, former assistant administrator of the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION>, told the subcommittee that the day the news story appeared, an irate <PERSON> North </PERSON> called him to deny that he was responsible for the leak. <PERSON> Monastero </PERSON> said that <PERSON> North </PERSON> accused the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> of telling a reporter that <PERSON> North </PERSON> was the source of the information. `` He called to say he did not leak the information and the proof was the facts -LRB- in the story -RRB- were not accurate,'' <PERSON> Monastero </PERSON> said. `` My response was, ` That's the standard way to cover your tracks.' I did n't accept that.'' <PERSON> Monastero </PERSON> said at another point, `` I thought the leak came from the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> because of the Contra vote that was coming up.''

 The fire that destroyed her home Thursday was one of many hardships that have beset <PERSON> Winnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> since her husband <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> leader, was sent to prison 26 years ago. She has spent 17 months in solitary confinement, lived in isolation, been arrested several times and passed virtually her entire adult life under stringent police restrictions and public scrutiny. Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> is 54 and was trained as a social worker. She has become a leading campaigner against apartheid and black activists often call her `` Mother of the Nation.'' Her commanding presence, controversial statements and willingness to confront authorities has made her one of the most visible symbols of opposition to white domination in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Another result of her prominence is that some of her personal hardships become public events. When she visits her husband at <LOCATION> Pollsmoor </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prison </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>, journalists are there. By the time she reached her burned-out home Thursday it was surrounded by firefighters, police and journalists who already had wandered through the smoldering remains. Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> saw the crowd, stayed in her car and went directly to an office she maintains nearby. Friends said the house held all her belongings, including wedding photographs, family documents and the piano her husband used to play. Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> moved into the modest four-room bungalow in <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>'s huge black township, after she married <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> in 1958. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> had owned the house and lived in it since the 1940s. It has been shot at and stoned by attackers who have not been identified. Police visit it regularly. After <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s arrest in 1962, Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> began receiving banning orders that prohibited her from addressing public gatherings, meeting with more than one person and entering places ranging from schools to printing houses. They applied from 1963 to 1986 except for one 18-month period. From May 1969 to September 1970 she was held in solitary confinement, tried twice under the Terrorism Act and acquitted both times. Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> was imprisoned for six months in 1974 for violating the banning order and detained for four months in 1976 after riots in <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>. A banning order issued in 1977 forced her to leave the <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> house and move to <LOCATION> Brandfort </LOCATION> in the rural <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>. Her home and office there were burned down in 1985 and she was allowed to return to the home in <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> a year later. Her defiance undimmed, Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> declared on her return: `` I should never have been away from home in the first place. I am grateful to no one. It was my right to be at home.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Mandelas </ORGANIZATION> have two daughters. <PERSON> Zindzi </PERSON>, 27, lives with her mother, and <PERSON> Zenani </PERSON>, 29, is studying at <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> with her husband, a member of <LOCATION> Swaziland </LOCATION>'s royal family.

 The home that has belonged to <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> and his family since the 1940s was gutted in an arson attack Thursday that apparently involved a teen-gang dispute and was not aimed at Mandela himself. Police said no one was hurt and no arrests were made. Capt. <PERSON> Ruben </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloomberg </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> that 30 to 50 black high school students stoned the home of the imprisoned leader of the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, doused it with gasoline and set it afire. Neighbors and black journalists said some attackers wore jackets of <PERSON> Daliwonga </PERSON> high school in <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>, and were involved in a dispute Wednesday with the young <PERSON> black </PERSON> `` comrades'' who guard the home. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Winnie </PERSON>, a prominent anti-apartheid activist, was bound for a news conference concerning detainees when she learned of the fire, which broke out about noon -LRB- 6 a.m. EDT -RRB-. Her daughter, <PERSON> Zindzi </PERSON>, 27, and her two grandchildren, who also live at the four-room home, were away at the time. But neighbors and journalists said some of the `` comrades'' who often travel with Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> and guard her home were at the house when the fire began. State of emergency regulations restrict reporting about unrest, security force action, treatment of detainees, some forms of protest and a range of statements classified as subversive. The Rev. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON>, general secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION>, said leaders in <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> and other black townships had been asked `` to call upon the community not to act emotionally so they do not create a situation where there is a spiral of violence.'' He said an attempt would be made to talk to the principal and the students of the school involved to ease the situation. He said young men who congregate around the Mandela home were told `` not to act without thinking or with revenge.'' Although the dispute is local, he said, `` when it is <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s house that is attacked, that makes it a national issue Anybody who attacks a well-known leader's house like that one would know they would anger the people in the community and cause them to take action.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> arrived by car about an hour later and viewed the blackened windows and burned furniture in the yard from inside the car. She then was driven to her nearby offices where she conducts social welfare projects. The `` comrades,'' some wearing jackets of the <ORGANIZATION> Mandela </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> soccer club, sponsored by the family, pushed journalists away from the office. One threatened to burn a photographer's car. Later, attorney <PERSON> Amrichand </PERSON> <PERSON> Soma </PERSON> told reporters <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> was reached at <LOCATION> Pollsmoor </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prison </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>, where he is serving a life term for sabotage and plotting to overthrow the white-dominated government, and said no statement should be made. However, <PERSON> Aubrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Mokoena </PERSON>, a family friend and head of the <ORGANIZATION> Release </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mandela </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION>, said: `` The community must ... put an end to this. Anyone who would think of attacking <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s house represents the forces of darkness.'' Journalists were allowed to enter the still-smoking home in the <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> section of <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>, while black police with shotguns kept a crowd of 300 neighbors away. A sodden carpet of hot, black ash covered everything. Flames flickered in a side room. The house was filled with steam from the heat and the water. Firemen pushed clothes out a bedroom window, pulled a smoldering mattress outside, shoved smoking cabinets and chairs onto the lawn. All the contents, including framed wedding pictures and the family piano, were destroyed. Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> has lived in the house periodically since she married <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> in 1958. Last year she built a mansion on a hill overlooking this huge black township outside of <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, a few blocks from the burned home. But <PERSON> Mokoena </PERSON> said the new house is not habitable and she would spend the night with friends. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> moved into the house with his first wife, <PERSON> Evelyn </PERSON>, in the 1940s and raised his two sons and his oldest daughter there. <PERSON> Evelyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> lives in the Xhosa tribal homeland of <LOCATION> Transkei </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Court Orders FEC to Respond to Dukakis-Bentsen Campaign Fund Suit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal appeals court late Thursday ordered the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to respond to a request that the presidential campaign of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> be barred from spending federal campaign funds until a dispute over the financing is resolved. The court order said the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> must respond by Monday to a motion to block the spending of the money, and the court invited lawyers for the Dukakis-Bentsen campaign to respond as well. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senatorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> opponent for the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat, Rep. <PERSON> Beau </PERSON> <PERSON> Boulter </PERSON>, are seeking to block the federal campaign money. They charge that by running simultaneously for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and for vice president _ as <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> law allows _ <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> gains an unfair financial advantage over Republicans. The <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> rejected that argument on Tuesday when it released $ 46 million in federal campaign money for the Democratic ticket. Republicans appealed the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> decision to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>, and a three-judge panel decided late Thursday to solicit arguments in the case. The appeal contended that the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> action was arbitrary and contrary to federal campaign financing law and asked that the Democrats be barred from spending any of the $ 46 million until the matter is resolved. `` The court has found this a serious enough issue to require its review,'' said <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Ginsberg </PERSON>, legal counsel for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> campaign committee. `` They are asking the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> to say why it acted properly.'' The three-judge panel was made up of Chief Judge <PERSON> Spottswood </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, Judge <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> Silberman </PERSON>, and Judge <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ginsburg </PERSON>. Republicans say <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> has some $ 4 million in private funds set aside for his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> campaign which he can spend in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> but which will also benefit the party's presidential ticket, in effect violating the $ 46 million spending ceiling for presidential campaigns and the use of private money for the general election race.

 Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> turned up the heat on the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> on Thursday, saying if the Democratic ticket is elected `` the ethics office will be in the Oval Office, not some place down the hall.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also began wooing local supporters of former rival <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> as he campaigned across the industrial <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, holding meetings with former <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> delegates and local elected officials who backed <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in the Democratic primaries. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor hammered at <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> and the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration in a speech at an outdoor shopping mall in <LOCATION> Secaucus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, in the <LOCATION> Meadowlands </LOCATION> area, and kept up the attack at a rally before 2,000 people in downtown <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>. `` I want to tell you that in 1989, we're going to have a president and vice president who wo n't sit by and do nothing when they're told by high-ranking officials in the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> that the attorney general of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been violating the law,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. His remarks included a dig at Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal this week to create a White House ethics office He was referring to two former top <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials, former assistant attorney general <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> and former deputy attorney general <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>, who told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> earlier this week that they had voiced concerns about <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s actions before resigning. `` I hope I never have to listen to that kind of briefing,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` But if I do I can tell you I wo n't sit there and do nothing. We'll take action.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> departed from the text of his prepared speech, devoted to calling for investment in jobs and economic opportunity, to comment on <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> and the broader subject of impropriety by some serving in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. He repeated lines from his nomination acceptance speech delivered at the Democratic National Convention last week when he said in his administration those who violate the public trust will be fired and `` if you violate the law you'll be prosecuted.'' In <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> praised, but was not accompanied by, the state's two Democratic senators: <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, whom he passed over in selecting <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> as his running mate, and <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, who faces a tough re-election fight this year. In an interview with a local television station, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he picked <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> after deciding the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator `` had the right stuff'' _ a phrase that recalled the title of the book and movie that depicted <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>'s life as astronaut. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> met privately with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> supporters in <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, and in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, and spokesman <PERSON> Dayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> said he would meet with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> supporters Friday in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> _ the state where <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> stunned <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> with a two-one victory in the March caucuses. <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Sharpe </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON>, who had been a Jackson delegate, said some in the group had been disappointed by <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' selection of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> as his running mate but that all seemed pleased by their 20-minute discussion with the nominee. `` Now we're ready to support <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> _ he won,'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> said, pointing to the new <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>'88 button he had just put on his lapel. `` I have now replaced my <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> button,'' he said in an interview. `` ... The alternative is to support <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> or to do nothing and allow <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to win.'' <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Payne </PERSON>, a member of the <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> city council and Democratic nominee for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> showed `` a very good grasp of urban issues'' but made no commitment for more federal spending. <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiley </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> senior adviser who sat in on the meeting, said one purpose of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' campaign trip was to meet with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> supporters in cities where he is stopping. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also stopped at a day-care center where he was photographed talking with small children. In his speech, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spoke about his call for a `` new era of greatness'' made in his acceptance speech. `` It begins with the recognition that a strong economic future needs three fundamental things _ investment, innovation and teamwork,'' he said. He called for more investment in research, including by business leaders, to keep up with research and training by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and other countries. `` I want to restore some balance to our federal research and development programs, and we'd better not forget that our military strength can not be sustained without economic strength _ a lesson the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has finally learned, and we must too,'' he said. As <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spoke, about a dozen anti-abortion protesters stood a short distance away and chanted `` Civil Rights for Unborn Babies.'' The nominee walked close by them as he left.

<HEAD>Government Suspends Journalist Registration Plan Temporarily</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GREG MYRE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government ordered a temporary suspension Thursday of rules that would require some journalists to register or face penalties, including jail. The regulations were to take effect Sunday. Media groups in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and abroad accused the South African government of attempting to make further inroads on press freedom. <PERSON> Stoffel </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, home affairs minister, said registration of journalists `` remains a matter of grave concern for the government,'' but the regulations were suspended temporarily because of `` practical considerations.'' He said they would be reviewed, but did not indicate when a decision would be made. The broadly worded rules now say anyone carrying out `` news-agency'' business must register or face a 10-year prison term or a $ 8,500 fine. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s largest news agency, the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, and such major international agencies as The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> are exempt. Local journalists who work part-time for some of the world's large news organizations would be required to register if, as many do, they had more than one employer Lawyers say the definition of a `` news agency'' is so broad that major newspapers that exchange stories, church and political groups that publish newsletters, and businesses that issue regular press statements on their operations could be included if the government wished. Under the regulations, <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> could remove journalists from the registration list and prevent them from working if he objected to their reporting. He already has broad censorship powers that allow him to close publications and expel foreign journalists. The latest regulations appear aimed at small, local news agencies but most news organizations operating in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> would be affected because they get reports from those agencies. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> has said local agencies endanger public safety by reporting unfavorably on police activities, forced removals of poor blacks and labor disputes in rural areas that other news organizations do not cover regularly. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correspondents </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has said even journalists not required to register would be compromised because they would be seen as having favored status with the government. State-of-emergency regulations already in force restrict reporting about unrest, security force actions, treatment of detainees, some forms of protest and a broad range of statement the government considers subversive. Under the official apartheid policy, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s 26 million blacks have no voice in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate residential districts, schools and health services.

 Aides to Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> traded barbs Thursday over an assertion by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> Campaign Manager <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had `` commuted the sentences of 58 violent criminals'' while governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> Campaign Manager <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Estrich </PERSON> immediately denied the claim, saying, `` Poor <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>. After his candidate failed in his attempt to promote a positive message on either ethics or day care, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> is returning to the well-traveled low road preferred by political muggers.'' In a statement, <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> said that among the 58 criminals whose sentences he claimed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had commuted were `` 28 first-degree murderers and a convicted heroin dealer.'' `` Dukakis ... also commuted the sentences of 25 convicted second-degree murderers, some of whom had served sentences of as little as two to five years,'' <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> said. `` It appears that <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> just ca n't stand the thought of violent criminals spending time behind bars,'' <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> said.

He said the figures the likely Republican nominee used were taken from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> state records. `` The only reason crime has gone down in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> is that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has let all the criminals out of jail and they've gone to other states,'' <PERSON> Goodin </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has repeatedly criticized a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> prison furlough program that allowed passes for first-degree murderers. The program was later amended, but not until after one of the prisoners escaped from a furlough and raped a <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> woman.

 <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernsen </PERSON> learned of his Emmy nomination in a long-distance wake-up call from his mother; <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Jillian </PERSON> heard when she punched the telephone message playback button; and <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> heard it on the radio. Nominations for the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> coveted Emmy Awards were announced Thursday. <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` L.A. Law'' swept the bulk of nods with 19. `` L.A. Law'' producer-creator <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Bochco </PERSON> furiously hunted for the telephone numbers of his far-flung cast to congratulate them. Because of the 21-week <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> strike, the actors were hard to find. `` Normally everybody is hard at work so you just walk on stage and tell them. Now we're looking for telephone numbers,'' said <PERSON> Bochco </PERSON>, adding, `` We're very excited.'' The on-screen and real life husband-wife duo <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jill </PERSON> <PERSON> Eikenberry </PERSON>, called the `` Tucker-Berrys'' by the `` L.A. Law'' crew, were out of town. <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> was doing a film in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> and his wife was in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. `` We will find them somehow,'' said <PERSON> Bochco </PERSON>. `` Steve called me. I'm thrilled,'' said <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rachins </PERSON>, another of the show's nominees, and `` L.A. Law'' star <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dey </PERSON> was especially taken with surprise at her nomination, wondering aloud what she would wear to the ceremony. <PERSON> Bernsen </PERSON> got a wakeup call in <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> from his mother, actress <PERSON> Jeanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, who told him of his nomination. She was nominated last year for her `` L.A. Law'' guest role playing <PERSON> Bernsen </PERSON>'s mother. `` She just said, ` I'm sorry I woke you up, but congratulations.' I said, ` What for?' and she told me I got a nomination,'' he said. <PERSON> Bernsen </PERSON>, who has just begun filming the the movie `` Major League'' with <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Berringer </PERSON>, was then read a list of his competitors and exclaimed `` Great!'' when he learned co-star <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> was nominated. `` Pretty good guys to be with, I'd say. Now I'll see who my friends are,'' he said. <PERSON> Bernsen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bochco </PERSON> said the key to `` L.A. Law's'' success could be a sophistication that appeals to audiences young and old. `` It has the serial thing people like to follow and it's got sophistication. As I've always said, I think we acknowledge the intelligence of the viewing audience,'' <PERSON> Bernsen </PERSON> said. `` We like to think we do n't insult them,'' <PERSON> Bochco </PERSON> said. `` We have good stories and that great ensemble group. We draw inspiration from their ability.'' Miss <PERSON> Jillian </PERSON> was overwhelmed by the two nominations for the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> movie `` The <ORGANIZATION> Ann </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jillian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Story </ORGANIZATION>'' _ leading actress in a miniseries or special and best drama-comedy special. It dealt with her battle with breast cancer. `` I woke up, stumbled into the living room and I pushed the -LRB- telephone -RRB- message unit and a voice said, ` Congratulations on your Emmy nomination.' I just could n't believe it,'' she said. `` I'm very honored and very thrilled, but the nomination is n't for me It goes for all those ladies who had to go through this. I tried to do this with dignity and above all hope. I'm so grateful.'' Actor <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Busfield </PERSON>, nominated for supporting actor in the drama series `` thirtysomething,'' was acknowledged for an episode dealing with a marriage counseling session. `` I owe this to all the women I've ever had fights with,'' he said. Miss White was putting on her makeup when she heard about her third nomination for `` The Golden Girls.'' `` Is n't this exciting? I ca n't believe it,'' she said. Asked if an Emmy nomination meant much this third time, she said, `` Sure, I do n't take it lightly. It's your peer group saying they like you.'' Miss White and `` Golden Girl'' <PERSON> Rue </PERSON> <PERSON> McClanahan </PERSON> have won past acting Emmys, so both are now rooting for wins this time by co-stars <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON> <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> and <PERSON> Estelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Getty </PERSON>. All four are nominated, Miss Getty in the supporting actress category.

 The designer of the Vietnam War Memorial said Thursday she hopes her latest work, a somber monument to the civil rights movement, will make people remember the bloody struggle for racial equality. `` The Vietnam Memorial has an impact on the immediate family. This is about the importance of not forgetting the civil rights movement,'' said <PERSON> Maya </PERSON> <PERSON> Lin </PERSON>, whose black wall in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> bearing the names of dead American soldiers has prompted emotional outpourings. Ms. <PERSON> Lin </PERSON> said the planned civil rights monument will bear the names of about 30 people killed during the civil rights era of the 1950s and'60s. `` The name is one of the most magical ways to bring back a person,'' she said. `` It's more real than any one image can be.'' The $ 350,000 memorial will be located on a slope in front of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poverty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, a Montgomery-based, public-interest law firm specializing in civil rights issues. The memorial will be a short walk from the church where a young Rev. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> gained prominence by leading the <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> bus boycott, often cited as the start of the contemporary American civil rights movement. Ms. <PERSON> Lin </PERSON>'s design calls for an upper plaza with a quiet pool and water that cascades down the face of a curved, black wall 40 feet long. Inscribed in gold leaf on the wall will be a section of King's `` I Have a Dream Speech,'' saying: `` We will not be satisfied until justice rolls down like water and righteousness like a mighty stream.'' In the lower plaza, a circular stone table 12 feet in diameter will be inscribed with time lines and the names of people killed during the civil rights movement from 1955 to 1968. Water emerging from the center of the table will flow evenly across its surface. The time lines will begin with the Aug. 28, 1955, murder of <PERSON> Emmett </PERSON> <PERSON> Till </PERSON> in Money, Miss. Till, a black man, was lynched after saying `` Bye, baby,'' to a white woman. The historical review will end April 4, 1968: the day King was assassinated in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn </LOCATION>. In addition to Till and King, among those listed will be <PERSON> Medgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Evers </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> official gunned down in front of his home in 1963; four children killed in 1963 when a bomb exploded at the 16th Street Baptist Church in <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>; and three men shot to death in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, during the `` Freedom Summer'' of 1964. Construction of the memorial will begin later this year, with completion scheduled for May 1989. The project will be funded by proceeds from the recent sale of property adjacent to law center.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Thursday his search for a Republican running mate is proceeding in an `` orderly fashion,'' but offered no clues about the outcome. Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> renewed his attack on the vice president's handling of Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s legal difficulties `` The process is going along in an orderly fashion,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters. `` Hopefully, it wo n't be demeaning to anyone.'' Sources said that <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republican Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> had been notified by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> that he was under consideration, among about a dozen prospects. Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> also is under consideration, at least in a preliminary way, said one source, speaking on condition of anonymity. Three Republicans are known to have received <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign requests for background information, including Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, who has figured prominently in speculation, and Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, who have not. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> embarked on a hectic campaign swing through seven Eastern and Midwestern states, combining fresh criticism for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> with a renewed effort to reach out to <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s primary-campaign supporters He said that if the Democrats win the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> this fall, `` the ethics office will be in the Oval Office, not some place down the hall.'' That was a jab at <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who said in a speech earlier in the week that he would appoint a special counselor on ethics to work in the White House and other agencies of the federal government. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also said that beginning next year, `` we're going to have a president and vice president who wo n't sit by and do nothing when they're told by high-ranking officials in the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> that the attorney general of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been violating the law.'' The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor's comment was a reference to congressional testimony earlier this week by two former top <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> aides, who said they had told President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> last spring that they had concerns about <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s legal difficulties. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also met privately in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> with about two dozen local officials, most of them black, who backed <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s drive for the Democratic presidential nomination. <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Sharpe </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> said the group was `` ready to support <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. ... The alternative is to support <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> or to do nothing and allow <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to win.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' post-convention high in the polls continued Thursday, as a <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> poll gave him an 18-point lead over <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. But pollster <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said such a wide margin was likely to be `` very temporary.'' <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>' survey of 1,268 likely voters found 57 percent support for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to 39 percent for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. It was the fourth national poll since the Democratic convention last week to find a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> lead of that magnitude. The new <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> poll was done July 22-25 and had a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points. Topic No. 1 in Republican circles was <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s search for a running mate _ and the campaign signals were anything but clear. One senior adviser, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the vice president had personally telephoned about a dozen prospective running mates to notify them they are being considered. Aside from <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, the names that have surfaced most consistently in speculation include <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> and Sens. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kassebaum </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s wife, former <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, also has been mentioned as a possible contender. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> joked during the day that he and his wife have been `` waiting for the phone to ring at home. I ca n't get <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> to leave the house.'' The Republican guessing game flourished while <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> convention in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> that the Reagan-Bush record for women and minorities is a `` speed bump on the path to equality in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' Meanwhile, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he has asked the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> secretary-general to ask Iranian officials for assistance in freeing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hostages held by Iranian sympathizers in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said `` no meeting has been set, and no meeting has been sought'' for him to negotiate personally with Iranian officials. `` We've simply talked through Secretary-General -LRB- <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>, who did meet with the <LOCATION> Iranian </LOCATION> foreign minister,'' he said in a telephone interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in an interview published in <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION>, called <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> a `` loose cannon'' and said he should stay out of the hostage affair. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he was unfamiliar with the facts about <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s effort, `` but as a general matter private citizens should not try to conduct foreign policy. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the dispute over $ 46 million in federal campaign money for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> entered a new phase as a federal appeals court ordered the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elections </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to respond to a request that the funds be held up. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senatorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> opponent for his <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat, Rep. <PERSON> Beau </PERSON> <PERSON> Boulter </PERSON>, are seeking to block the money. They charge that by running simultaneously for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and for vice president _ as <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> law allows _ <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> gains an unfair financial advantage over Republicans. The <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> rejected that argument on Tuesday when it released $ 46 million in federal campaign money for the Democratic ticket.

 Two Israeli border policemen were stoned and two <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> residents were wounded as troops battled demonstrators in the occupied territory on Thursday, the army said. Meanwhile, in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> seized an Arab-owned house after the High Court of Justice ruled the army could evict residents and set up a command post. The house sits on the strategic Jerusalem-Hebron road. `` The military government said ... they must do something to stop the throwing of stones,'' <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Abuy </PERSON> <PERSON> Riad </PERSON>, who lived in the house, told Israeli television. `` But the stones were n't thrown by me ... I am innocent.'' A military representative, speaking on condition of anonymity, said violent protests broke out in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s Sheikh Radwan neighborhood on Thursday. Two military border policemen were hit by rocks, and two Gazans were shot in the legs and slightly wounded, the official said. Also Thursday, a <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> man, 37-year-old <PERSON> Hadel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> el </PERSON> <PERSON> Toruk </PERSON>, died after he was shot four times last Friday in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The shooting occurred at the same time that soldiers fired at a group of Arabs after one threw a firebomb in central <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, the army said. The military spokesman said the army was checking to see if <PERSON> Toruk </PERSON> was shot by the troops. If so, he would be the 235th Palestinian killed in the eight-month revolt against Israeli rule in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, the territories captured from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> in the 1967 Middle East War. Four Israelis have also been killed. In politics, Israeli Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said Thursday that he welcomed meetings between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION>, as long as they do not belong to the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> has said he wants to meet again with Palestinians in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, something he had done in the past. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official is scheduled to travel to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> during the first week in August for a peace mission that will take him to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Anita </PERSON> <PERSON> Stockman </PERSON> said Thursday she was unaware of any concrete plans for <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> to talk to Palestinian leaders. She also said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy of refusing to meet <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leaders remained in place. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said he did not care if the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> that might meet with <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> supported the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> ideologically, as long as they were not members. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> refuses to talk to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, calling it a terrorist group. `` We do not censor ideas ...'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said. `` They should come without rocks, without knives, without fire bombs.''

<HEAD>35 Percent Crop Damage Would Trigger Disaster Payments</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Producers of any commercial crop would be eligible for disaster payments under drought aid legislation passed by both houses Thursday if they lost more than 35 percent of their 1988 harvest due to drought. Under the House version, they also would be eligible if the damage was caused by hail, floods or other natural disasters. Producers of crops covered by federal farm programs and those that are not would be equally eligible for the payments, which would equal 65 percent of their losses over the 35 percent threshold. Growers whose crops were very severely damaged would be eligible for supplemental payments. Under the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> bill, this would amount to an additional 30 percent of losses over 75 percent of expected harvest. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> version would provide an additional 20 percent of losses over 75 percent of the yield that farmers had anticipated. Under the House bill, farmers would be required to buy federal crop insurance for the next two crop years to be eligible for disaster payments. Livestock producers already eligible for existing government feed programs and those in areas where <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> determines a feed emergency exists would be eligible for a new program that begins 15 days after the measure becomes law. It would reimburse up to 50 percent of the cost of replacement feed purchased during the emergency, allow sale of government-owned feed at reduced rates, donate government feed to producers unable to purchase it, pay up to 50 percent of some feed transportation costs and provide up to half the cost of deepening wells and certain other steps needed to water livestock.

 The Iranian foreign minister will not meet the Rev. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> to discuss the possible release of Americans held hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> by pro-Iranian factions, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> ambassador said Thursday.

However, Iranian Ambassador <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ja'afar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahallati </PERSON> said Thursday that his country's foreign minister, <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON>, was focusing on ending the Iran-Iraq war, not on releasing hostages, while in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` He does n't have a mandate to embark on anything other than implementation of the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> Resolution 598'' on a cease-fire and peace plan to end the war, <PERSON> Mahallati </PERSON> said in answer to questions. `` Indeed, not,'' <PERSON> Mahallati </PERSON> said when asked if <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> would meet <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. Earlier Thursday, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> telephoned <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> about the hostages and asked him to convey a message to <LOCATION> Velayati </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials said. They said the secretary-general did so. But <PERSON> Mahallati </PERSON> said his mission had not yet received a communication from Perez de Cuellar. `` I do n't think the minister -LRB- <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> -RRB- had intended in this visit to make any effort in this line, and we do n't have any mandate to embark on any such discussion,'' <PERSON> Mahallati </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> told reporters Wednesday night that he had raised the problem of American hostages `` very, very specifically'' with <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> during a meeting that day. `` I can confirm that the Rev. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> telephoned the secretary-general early today about the fate of the American hostages and asked that this message be conveyed to the foreign minister of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>,'' the secretary-general's spokesman, <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>, said in answer to reporters' questions. `` This was conveyed by the secretary-general to the foreign minister.'' <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> did not elaborate. Earlier Thursday, the Iranian Mission's counselor, <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Javad </PERSON> <PERSON> Zarif </PERSON>, said there had been no approach from the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> camp and said, `` I do not think that there are any specific issues that we'll have to talk about.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said Wednesday in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> that he had sought a meeting with <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> through the secretary-general to discuss obtaining release of the American hostages. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has said it could intercede to obtain their freedom if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> agreed to release Iranian assets frozen in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has said it is willing to discuss the issue but has rejected any deal or payment of ransom. Nine Americans are among 18 foreigners being held hostage by pro-Iranian extremists in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Longest held is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 40, was abducted in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on March 16, 1985.

 A news leak on a covert plan to undermine Panamanian military ruler <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> came from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and was a `` set-up deal'' to make it look like the disclosure came from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Boren </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., chairman of the panel, and the committee's ranking Republican, Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, said they believed the leak was a `` heavy-handed'' attempt to derail a bill that would tighten congressional oversight of covert operations, and also to enhance Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s political `` I think the matter was handled in such a way as to set up members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to make them appear the source of the leak,'' said <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>. `` I am offended by it.'' `` I think the <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> was used, in this case,'' added <PERSON> Boren </PERSON>. <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> said the whole matter had been handled in highly unusual fashion, including a much wider dissemination than is normal for information about presidential covert action authorizations, which are known as `` findings.'' `` I have a feeling it's much broader. More people than normal knew,'' <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> said, possibly including members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> outside the 15 senators and 17 <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members who are on the intelligence panels. `` If they've briefed other people, we ca n't be responsible for that,'' said <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>. <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> said reporters already were calling the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and waiting outside its secure hearing room on Tuesday even before the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> briefing began. <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said he expressed suspicions about the possibility of a leak before any information was given in the briefing. In <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> on Thursday called reports of the covert action plan `` intolerable'' and `` terrorist'' and said the Panamanian government would take a complaint to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. `` It is intolerable and irritating that in the highest spheres of power in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> they talk of possible terrorist actions in <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> territory,'' the government news agency <PERSON> Panapres </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> as saying. He added that `` the Panamanian authorities are maintaining a state of alert to reject any type of terrorist action.'' On Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had signed a finding authorizing unspecified covert activities aimed at undermining <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s rule. The military ruler has clung to power for months despite previous <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> efforts to weaken the Panamanian economy, and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> inability to budge him has become a political liability for the administration. Later reports said the covert action authorization included support for the country's internal political opposition, but stopped short of direct military or paramilitary action. Legislation is due to come to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor within the next two weeks which would require notification of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> intelligence committees within 48 hours of any covert action plan signed by the president. The measure, prompted by last year's Iran-Contra investigation, is designed to tighten current law, which requires only that unspecified `` timely notice'' be given to <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> overseers. The administration strongly opposes the bill, calling it a strait jacket on the president's ability to conduct intelligence operations and arguing that in cases of extremely sensitive covert acts the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> must be free to withhold notification from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> said he did not believe the administration action would have any significant impact on future <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy decisions, and added that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> would be unaffected by any threat from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> does n't put much stock in words,'' said <PERSON> Boren </PERSON>. `` I think it's time we went back to <PERSON> Teddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>'s admonition. We've talked loudly and carried a small stick I do n't think hurling more words at him is going to work.''

 Black parents and students are boycotting white businesses in a campaign to oust the white superintendent of the mostly black school district. The controversy began in the spring when 87 of the system's 9,200 students failed a new standardized test needed to pass to the next grade <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON>, who heads the protest for the group, called Save Our Children, said the test issue is now a `` dead horse.'' He said, however, that the test encouraged parents to join the protest as their anger grew. Protesters said Wednesday they would expand their action to pressure the <ORGANIZATION> Greenville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schools </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trustees </ORGANIZATION> to fire Superintendent <PERSON> Nolan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vickers </PERSON> and his assistant, <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Sweatt </PERSON>, who also is white. Protesters accuse <PERSON> Vickers </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sweatt </PERSON> of being insensitive to the needs of blacks, who comprise more than 90 percent of the school system's students. <PERSON> Vickers </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sweatt </PERSON> were in meetings Thursday and unavailable for comment, said Assistant Superintendent <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Peyton </PERSON>, who is black. When asked if he has any problems with the current school administration, <PERSON> Peyton </PERSON> replied, `` No I do n't because I'm instrumental in running it In the things that are coming out, I'm as much responsible for it as anyone else. School Board President <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON>, who is black, declined to comment on the boycott, but said board members probably would discuss it at their Aug. 11 meeting. Parents and students marched Wednesday in groups as small as four and as large as eight in front of department stores, a shopping mall, two fast-food restaurants and a car dealership. `` We're definitely making an impact,'' said <PERSON> Long </PERSON>, who teaches biology in the school district. `` Our being out here is against the will of the white business community.''

 Negotiators for scriptwriters and television and film producers agreed to resume contract talks Friday to try to end the 21-week walkout that has idled <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> production, a federal mediator said Thursday. <PERSON> Floyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, district director for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mediation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conciliation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, asked negotiators to return to the bargaining table Friday afternoon.

The network had planned to replace `` The Magical World of Disney'' with a recast version of `` The Hardy Boys,'' using old scripts. `` The Hardy Boys'' will now move to another weeknight. The Disney series, set to debut Oct. 9, will be filled with feature films, old <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> specials and compilation programs until an end to the writer's strike provides original programming. The union has been on strike since March 7. Issues in the impasse are payments for reruns of one-hour television shows rebroadcast domestically and all shows rebroadcast overseas.

 Bodies found in a charred home have been identified as those of child actress <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Barsi </PERSON>, who died at the hands of her actor father in the movie `` Fatal Vision,'' and her mother, the coroner's office said Thursday. A man's body found in the house after the fire Wednesday previously was identified as the child's father, <PERSON> Jozsef </PERSON>, 55, who apparently shot his wife and child to death, set the family home afire and then killed himself. The bodies of <PERSON> Judith </PERSON>, 11, and her mother, <PERSON> Maria </PERSON>, 48, were positively identified at the scene by physical characteristics, said coroner's investigator <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Riddle </PERSON>. The family's nearest relatives were in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and no funeral arrangements had been made, he said. Miss <PERSON> Barsi </PERSON> made her film debut in 1987 in `` Jaws IV: The Revenge,'' in which she played the role of <PERSON> Thea </PERSON>. Her television appearances included roles in `` St. Elsewhere,'' `` <PERSON> Cagney </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lacey </PERSON>'' and `` Growing Pains,'' said <PERSON> Bonnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Gold </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for an acting agency that managed her career. She also played convicted killer <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>'s daughter in the movie `` Fatal Vision.'' She, her sister and pregnant mother were killed in the movie, which was based on a true story. Neighbors said <PERSON> Barsi </PERSON> was an overprotective father and abusive husband who had threatened to kill his 48-year-old wife and burn their home. Next door neighbor <PERSON> Eunice </PERSON> <PERSON> Daly </PERSON> said Mrs. <PERSON> Barsi </PERSON> told her last week that her husband became abusive and threatening when he drank. She said Mrs. <PERSON> Barsi </PERSON> told her she was considering divorce but was afraid to move out. `` She said, ` I ca n't because he'll come after us and kill us and he's threatened to burn the house down,''' Ms. <PERSON> Daly </PERSON> said. Mrs. <PERSON> Barsi </PERSON> said she planned to cash her daughter's $ 12,000 federal tax refund check that day, before her husband could get it, the neighbor said. The child's body was found in her bed and the woman's in a hallway, police Lt. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Knowles </PERSON> said. He said both had been shot once in the head. `` The child was not allowed to go anywhere, very few places alone,'' neighbor <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. `` Even when she came to our home, it always had to be OK'd by Dad.''

Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> told members of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> in the elected lower chamber: `` If more people came with an open mind and looked at what is happening on the ground, we would have many others making similar remarks.'' `` I admire Mr. <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>'s forthrightness and I am glad he took time to come to <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>,'' she added. In <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> was described as one of the few <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> politicians of stature who have had anything positive to say about <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s role in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. `` His comments after his factfinding visit to <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> are as refreshing as they are surprising'' the <ORGANIZATION> Belfast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s independent evening newspaper, commented editorially on Thursday. `` Compare his statement ` My impression is that the British are trying to play a constructive role' with the attack launched by Congressman <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> after his visit earlier this year'' the newspaper said, refering to the Democratic <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> representative from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. `` Mr. <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> has shown an attitude uncommon in <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> politicians when dealing with the Irish problem _ a willingness to view the situation with an open mind. `` He is also honest enough to admit that his vision of Ulster from across the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> did not square up with what he found here: ` I do not believe that they -LRB- the British -RRB- deserve the castigation that many of us, myself included, have heaped upon them,''' the <ORGANIZATION> Belfast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> as saying. `` Too many people in the international community mistake the myths and propaganda emanating from these shores for facts and believe a British withdrawal is the simplistic solution to all our ills. Mayor <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> realizes the problems are much more complex than other ` green-tinted' visionaries understand,'' the newspaper said. `` Of course, the hardline Irish-American lobbyists will attempt to make political capital from his comments but those Americans who are willing to listen will learn much more about the reality of life in <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> today from Mayor <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>. `` They should, as must the people of <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION>, learn that harboring grievances for past errors or wrongs will not further the quest for peace here,'' the newspaper said. `` There have been historical mistakes in <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, on all sides, but acknowledgment should also be given, as Mayor <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> does, for the positive contributions made in areas like housing, jobs and electoral representation. We can build on gains not divisions.''

 The Sandinista newspaper <PERSON> Barricada </PERSON> saluted a convoy of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> veterans that is bringing food, medicine and clothes to the capital with a banner headline Thursday reading, `` Veterans Break <PERSON> Boycott </PERSON>.'' The Veterans' Peace Convoy was expected in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> Friday and would turn over the supplies to the government at a ceremony at the Revolution Plaza downtown. <PERSON> Barricada </PERSON> said thousands of people greeted the convoy of 20 vehicles and 44 activists when it crossed the Honduran-Nicaraguan border Wednesday after months of opposition from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> initially refused to let the convoy cross the U.S.-Mexico border, saying taking the vehicles to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> would violate a 1985 trade embargo. Humanitarian aid is permitted under the embargo, but the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> says the vehicles must return to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The convoy people oppose <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> backing of the rebels, known as Contras, in their almost 7-year-old war against <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist Sandinista government. <PERSON> Barricada </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> police `` brutally repressed'' the group in its attempt to bring `` medicine, food and clothes for Nicaraguan children butchered by the war action of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration.'' Eight members of the group were arrested July 9 when they refused to leave the road leading to a toll booth at a <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> bridge crossing in <LOCATION> Laredo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The convoy finally crossed the Mexican border at <LOCATION> Nuevo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Laredo </LOCATION> on July 14.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military experts left the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> on Thursday after a 3 -LCB- - week investigation of the destruction of an Iranian airliner by an American warship, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials said The team led by Rear Adm. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fogarty </PERSON> arrived July 5, two days after missiles fired by the cruiser <ORGANIZATION> USS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vincennes </ORGANIZATION> hit an Iran Air Airbus flying over the <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION>, killing all 290 people aboard. <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials said officers of the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> mistook the Airbus A300 for an Iranian F-14 jet fighter on an attack course. <PERSON> Fogarty </PERSON>'s team worked in secret and made no statements before leaving. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials said the report would `` work its way up the chain of command'' to <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>. Because <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> is in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> until about Aug. 8, they said, the report could not be released until mid-August. Investigators compiled data from computer tapes on the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> and two other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships that were in the area, the frigate USS <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> and missile frigate <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sides </PERSON>. They also took sworn testimony from the commander of the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION>, Capt. <PERSON> Will </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, and other officers of the three warships. An initial 15-day deadline for the investigation was extended at <ORGANIZATION> Fogarty </ORGANIZATION>'s request. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials would not give details of the investigations and said contact with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> for information would have to be through diplomatic channels. The <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> has been assigned to the <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, just outside the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, and is expected to complete its tour at the end of summer. In <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION>, Iranian diplomat <PERSON> Gholamreza </PERSON> <PERSON> Behtashi </PERSON> said a five-member team from the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> is expected to arrive Friday in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s capital, to pursue its own investigation into the disaster. <PERSON> Behtashi </PERSON>, third secretary at the <ORGANIZATION> Iranian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, said the team is made up of technical personnel from the Montreal-based <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> agency. `` They will go from <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> and investigate the various aspects of the incident,'' <PERSON> Behtashi </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> asked the governing council of the agency to meet in special session to condemn the attack, but members refused to censure the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The 33-nation governing council ordered the inquiry on July 14. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegate <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON> <PERSON> Stohr </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will offer the investigating team whatever help it can. He said the team had not asked to board the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION>, and he did n't know if such a visit would be possible considering the military situation in the gulf. <ORGANIZATION> ICAO </ORGANIZATION> is a technical body composed of 159 nations. It sets standards for civil aviation and airline safety.

<HEAD>`Road,' A Play By Jim Cartwright, Opens Off-Broadway</HEAD>

 `` Road,'' a gritty, grimy and thoroughly fascinating journey through industrial <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, puts most of the audience where the action is _ right in the middle of an unnamed <ORGANIZATION> Lancashire </ORGANIZATION> town dying during <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s boom times. This provocative play, which opened Thursday at off-Broadway's La Mama Annex, lets theatergoers wander a dismal thoroughfare and mingle with the town's citizens The less adventurous can perch along a three-sided balcony and observe the action, but the distance would seem to dilute the drama. To get the full effect of <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON>' masterful direction, it's better to be right down on the road, a depressingly realistic environment designed by <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> does a remarkable job, not only with the actors but with the audience which follows the flow of the play across the playing area with minimal instruction from the performers. The setting reflects the dead-end dreams of its inhabitants. The hulk of an abandoned car sits on one corner of the playing area. Squat, dilapidated homes line one side of the street. Other open spaces become the oppressive parlors and bedrooms of these people who have lost all hope. Playwright <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Cartwright </PERSON> has written some bitter yet often very funny vignettes about their threadbare existence and stitched them together by creating a scruffy master of ceremonies named Scullery. The character is played with a roguish charm by <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON>. Scullery introduces the residents of the road, all of them in the process of going out for the evening. `` Going out'' for most of them means getting drunk. Several of the scenes are etched in despair. Audiences meet the middle-aged <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> who, in a poignant soliloquy, laments the days long ago when people had jobs, good times and felt `` safe.'' `` I ca n't get away from the past,'' he says. `` But no matter what they say, I ca n't see how that time could turn into this time.'' The hopelessness of today is reiterated throughout the play and <PERSON> Cartwright </PERSON> offers several variations on that desolation. In another sketch, a young man named <PERSON> Joey </PERSON> is on a hunger strike. `` They rush you from the cradle to the grave. But now we've come to a standstill, no job, no hope,'' he murmurs to his good-natured girlfriend who joins him in the starvation pact. There's also a defiance in the desperation, particularly in the play's powerful last scene when two young men pick up two girls and bring them home for booze and sex. The quartet is moved by <PERSON> Otis </PERSON> <PERSON> Redding </PERSON>'s recording of `` Try a Little Tenderness,'' and as they become progressively drunker, they chant fiercely, `` Somehow _ might escape.'' You get the impression that if they do n't, something terrible is going to happen. <PERSON> Cartwright </PERSON>'s play is overtly political and his message occasionally becomes heavy-handed. There are references to <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> and what kind of country <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> has become under <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> rule. But his characters are immensely human _ often humorous, often repugnant and completely believable. The play's seven actors portray a variety of characters and their versatility is a marvel. <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bacon </PERSON> gets the most difficult workout. He must switch from the impassioned hunger striker to a drunkenly catatonic soldier. As the striker's simple-minded girlfriend, <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cusack </PERSON> projects a delicacy that shines through all the despair. She radiates a sweetness that is captivating. Equally fine work comes from <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bamman </PERSON> as the nostaglic <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON>; <PERSON> Betsy </PERSON> <PERSON> Aidem </PERSON> as an old hag trying to get dressed to go out for an evening of fun; <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Wincott </PERSON>, an unnerving and menacing Skinhead, and <PERSON> Jayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON> as a sassy tart. `` Road'' is a joint production of <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theater </ORGANIZATION> and La Mama. For <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, it is another feather in an already crowded cap of shows that includes `` Anything Goes,'' `` Sarafina!'' and `` Speed-the-Plow.''

 War enemies <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> traded recriminations during a one-day suspension of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peace talks Thursday. The talks at an impasse over <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s insistence on direct talks and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s reluctance to agree. However, <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said the impasse did not mean peace talks were collapsing. He said he was working on a formula for breaking the disagreement. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> demands a face-to-face meeting before a truce and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> insists on a truce before it will consider a direct meeting at a later stage. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> accused <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> Thursday of stalling, sabotaging <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peace talks and blocking a truce in the 8-year-old Iran-Iraq war. Pressure was increasing on <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> in the 15-member <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> to drop its direct talks demand and other proposals that could prolong the fighting, according to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity. Foreign ministers <PERSON> Tariq </PERSON> <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> did not visit <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> headquarters Thursday after <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> called a one-day suspension in his revolving-door diplomacy aimed at ending the war. Iranian Ambassador <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ja'afar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahallati </PERSON> told reporters who asked about direct talks, `` We will maintain our position. We will not accept any preconditions -LRB- for direct talks -RRB-. No step can be taken before a cease-fire ... `` Accepting -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> cease-fire -RRB- Resolution 598 has been the last flexibility by the <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said he hoped Iranian officials `` are reflecting on the possibility of having direct talks at some stage,'' but said he can not compel the two sides to do so if <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> is unwilling. Later Thursday, he assumed a more positive tone, assuring reporters that talks were still under way. `` I reject the idea of any collapse absolutely. I reject it emphatically. I have to keep waiting,'' <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said, adding he believed `` at some stage, direct talks are indispensable.'' He acknowleded there was an impasse and, when asked if he had a formula for breaking it, said: `` I'm working on that.'' Also Thursday, <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> announced he would meet Friday with the wife of an American <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official kidnapped in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> last Feb. 17, Marine Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>. He said he would meet <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' wife, at <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> headquarters at her request. The Iraqi Mission insisted that `` given the Iranian duplicity and bad faith, peace can only be achieved through direct face-to-face negotiations'' under <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> auspices. It said that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s goal was lasting peace and not just a cease-fire. The deadlock over direct negotiations has complicated <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> efforts to end the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> conflict. Fighting continued Thursday, with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> saying it crushed an Iraqi force in two days of fighting around the western Iranian city of <LOCATION> Eslamabad </LOCATION>, 60 miles from the Iraqi border. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> suspended talks for a day to study his exchanges with the Iraqi and Iranian envoys since Tuesday. Meetings were to resume Friday. <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Javad </PERSON> <PERSON> Zarif </PERSON>, counselor at <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION>, told reporters direct talks would not promote peace at this time. He commented one day after <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> accepted all of <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>'s proposals on implementing the resolution's peace plan. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has not yet responded. Details of the proposals have not been disclosed. On Wednesday, <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> insists on direct talks with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> before a cease-fire and will not be `` stampeded'' into a truce without guarantees from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The Iraqi Mission accused <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> on Thursday of `` a malicious campaign to sow confusion in diplomatic efforts to achieve peace by flooding the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> and media with statements alleging that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> is fighting inside <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>.'' The mission said <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s recent military operations were carried out `` to liberate remnants of occupied <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> territories.'' It said troops only entered Iranian territory to liberate <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> land, and added: `` Iraqi forces have long since withdrawn. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has no territorial ambitions inside <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> accused <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> of `` simply seeking a hasty truce without giving any commitments that it will comply honestly and sincerely to the full implementation of the resolution as a plan for comprehensive and durable peace.'' `` The policy of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> is to put obstacles in the way of the secretary-general's peace efforts,'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Zarif </PERSON> said. `` This whole Iraqi exercise is planned to sabotage the efforts upon which the international community is looking with hope.'' The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> chief summoned both foreign ministers to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> this week for intensive consultations on setting a timetable for a U.N.-supervised cease-fire, a troop withdrawal, prisoner exchange, formal peace negotiations and creating a panel to determine which side started the war, all points contained in the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> resolution.

<HEAD>British Airways Grounds Top Concorde Pilot For Rest of Career</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday it grounded the most senior pilot of its supersonic Concorde jetliner division for the rest of his career because he broke company rules about fuel levels during a flight from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> in May. The airline said in a statement that it banned Capt. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Walpole </PERSON>, 54, from flying and confined him to his desk job as general manager of the Concorde division until he retires on his 55th birthday in December. Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> had honored <LOCATION> Walpole </LOCATION> just this year on the advice of the government by making him an officer of the Order of the British Empire. <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> said the Concorde that <LOCATION> Walpole </LOCATION> had been flying developed an hydraulic fault, forcing him to reduce speed and so use more fuel than normal. But it said that despite having the option of stopping at <LOCATION> Shannon </LOCATION> airport in <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> to take on more fuel, he flew on to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> airport. It said air traffic controllers at <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> responded to a request to clear the Concorde for a priority landing. The plane was found to have enough fuel for 25 more minutes flying instead of the minimum 30 required by <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> rules. `` A rule had been broken. Capt. <LOCATION> Walpole </LOCATION> has ceased flying duties and will carry on his managerial duties as general manager of the Concorde division until his time -LRB- for retirement -RRB- comes,'' the statement said. It said the 49 passengers on the flight were not endangered. <LOCATION> Walpole </LOCATION> was the first pilot to fly Concorde across the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on its inaugural supersonic flight from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, in 1977, after helping test-fly the plane. In 1985, he flew Queen <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> in a Concorde as a treat for her 85th birthday.

 Federal officials who have taken over an abandoned chemical plant in which a roof collapsed on already leaking drums warned worried residents Thursday night that they may face an emergency. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> spokesmen told about 300 residents who crowded into a school auditorium for a town meeting that the agency does not know what is in more than 1,000 decaying drums at <ORGANIZATION> Artel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` So the bottom line is, we're in danger?'' asked one woman in the audience after the two-hour question-and-answer session. `` We would n't be there if you were n't,'' answered Dr. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lafornara </PERSON>, with the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Response </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Team </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Edison </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> `` But the hazard has been there for years. You've been living with it. What we're saying is, in three or four months, it wo n't be there anymore.'' <PERSON> Lafornara </PERSON> characterized the site as one of the three most critical among hundreds he has worked with under the federal Superfund program, which draws money from the chemical industry to help clean up hazardous dump sites. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Yates </PERSON> said the plant had a long history of `` legal maneuvering'' and safety violations. He said the plant manufactured `` small batches of exotic chemicals'' that cleanup workers now are having trouble identifying. Former <ORGANIZATION> Artel </ORGANIZATION> employees attacked the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> for not hiring them to identify substances in the unmarked chemical drums, while some residents harshly criticized the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> for not stepping in years ago. <PERSON> Yates </PERSON> said the most pressing problems at the closed plant include at least 60 drums of highly volatile metallic sodium and a large tank containing 9,000 gallons of methyl mercaptan, a chemical that is mixed in with natural gas to give it an odor. <PERSON> Yates </PERSON> said the threat of a `` severe explosion'' had been created over the weekend when rain triggered a roof collapse at the plant's main warehouse `` There are drums that are rupturing as we speak,'' he had said Wednesday. `` We're talking about a major accident that could happen there.'' But <PERSON> Yates </PERSON> said Thursday an engineer determined that the building was structurally safe, and <ORGANIZATION> Kanawha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> Coordinator <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> played down the danger. `` I do not think the potential is any greater than it has been in the last five years,'' <PERSON> White </PERSON> said. `` The roof's been leaking for years. The barrels have been leaking for years.'' <PERSON> White </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> told him that Saturday's roof fall had punctured several barrels of acid and that water or moisture had reacted with the chemicals `` and they started fuming.'' But he said there was little environmental danger. The Artel plant is one of several chemical plants along a strech of <LOCATION> Kanawha </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> in western <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. Nitro, with about 8,000 residents, is about 12 miles west of <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>. The plant has been closed since 24 employees walked off the job June 6 in a pay dispute. They contended that they were being paid below minimum wage. Operations then were shut down after the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> obtained a federal court injunction against <ORGANIZATION> Artel </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has stepped in to clean up the unidentified chemicals at <ORGANIZATION> Artel </ORGANIZATION>, and an <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> company is finishing the first step of taking test samples from the containers. <PERSON> White </PERSON> said the chemicals will be moved for disposal, increasing the risk of spills and leaks at that time. The plant was owned and operated as <ORGANIZATION> Fike </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> for about 25 years by <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> <PERSON> Fike </PERSON>, who was retained as a minority owner and consultant by <ORGANIZATION> Artel </ORGANIZATION> when he sold the plant in 1986. <PERSON> Fike </PERSON> could not be reached at home Thursday and former plant manager <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Beal </PERSON>, <PERSON> Fike </PERSON>'s son-in-law, was out of town, a family member said.

 <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Messer </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> was executed in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>'s electric chair Thursday night for beating and stabbing his his 8-year-old niece to death when she fought his attempts to molest her <PERSON> Messer </PERSON>, 34, was pronounced dead at 7:23 p.m. Thursday, said <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Siler </PERSON>. Warden <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Zant </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Messer </PERSON> if he had any final words, and he said he did not. <PERSON> Messer </PERSON> did ask for a prayer, and prison Chaplain <PERSON> Nolan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lavelle </PERSON> placed his hands on <PERSON> Messer </PERSON>'s left forearm and gave about a one-minute prayer. At the conclusion, <PERSON> Messer </PERSON> said, `` Amen.'' Fourteen people witnessed the execution, including one of <PERSON> Messer </PERSON>'s attorneys. <PERSON> Messer </PERSON> did not ask for any personal witnesses to the execution, <PERSON> Siler </PERSON> said. His mother, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Messer </PERSON>, and an aunt visited him at the prison Wednesday. Outside the prison, 12 death penalty protesters sang, while about 20 pro-death penalty demonstrators, including one man wearing a white <PERSON> Ku </PERSON> <PERSON> Klux </PERSON> Klan robe, carried signs in favor of the execution. The execution came just over an hour after the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, in a 7-2 vote, refused to halt it. Justices <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> dissented, but there was no immediate elaboration from the court. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> order followed a similar action Thursday by the <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pardons </ORGANIZATION> and Paroles, which had been asked to commute <PERSON> Messer </PERSON>'s death sentence to life in prison. Chairman <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Snow </PERSON> said the panel concluded `` there are insufficient grounds for further consideration'' of the commutation request. Snow said the board rejected a psychiatrist's testimony that <PERSON> Messer </PERSON>'s `` explosive'' behavior may have been caused by brain damage. <PERSON> Messer </PERSON> was convicted of the Feb. 13, 1979, slaying of <PERSON> Rhonda </PERSON> <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON>. Prosecutors said he abducted her from her school in <LOCATION> Cedartown </LOCATION>, tried to molest her and then killed her when she fought him. Her parents, <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cedartown </LOCATION>, came to the prison Thursday with 28 friends and neighbors carrying signs with slogans like `` Ten Years Too Long'' and `` <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON> Family Finally Gets Justice.'' After the execution, <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON>, 47, tearfully said the death was `` a big relief. He finally paid.'' `` We feel we can finally put our baby to rest,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON>, 45. <PERSON> Messer </PERSON> was the 13th person executed in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>'s electric chair since the state resumed executions in 1983. He was the 101st person put to death in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> allowed states to retore capital punishment in 1976. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> rejected <PERSON> Messer </PERSON>'s appeal for a stay Wednesday, and the <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> denied a stay Monday <PERSON> Messer </PERSON> was sentenced to death in 1980. Prosecutors said he abducted his niece after telling school officials her father had been hurt. The girl's body, clad in a shirt, was found the next day. Testimony in <PERSON> Messer </PERSON>'s trial showed he had led her into the woods and tried to molest her. When she resisted, he kicked her, slashed her stomach five times, beat and stabbed her, then left her to die. <PERSON> Messer </PERSON>'s lawyers contended their client was mentally incompetent and thus, under a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling, could not be put to death. The attorneys also have argued that <PERSON> Messer </PERSON>'s civil rights were violated when state prison officials refused to allow neurological tests for a possible brain tumor. <PERSON> Messer </PERSON> came within 15 hours of execution two years ago, but won a stay from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. The case later went back to the <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, which voted 7-5 to uphold the death sentence.

 The administration on Thursday projected the federal deficit for the upcoming budget year at $ 140.1 billion _ short of the trigger for across-the-board spending cuts _ but warned that a hefty drought-relief bill could cause the automatic reductions to kick in. The new deficit estimate, covering the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1, is $ 5.9 billion below the $ 146 billion level that would force politically painful cuts under the Gramm-Rudman budget law. However, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION>, said that the drought relief bill and several other spending proposals could quickly wipe out the cushion and trigger the spending cuts, which would take effect right before the November elections. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> supports drought relief, a popular initiative in an election year, but he said the president does n't want to `` use the plight of the farmers as an opportunity to make a Christmas tree out of that bill'' by loading it up with provisions that have little to do with drought relief. Later Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved a drought bill providing up to $ 5.8 billion in assistance for farmers, while the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> passed a drought relief measure estimated to cost between $ 5.85 billion and $ 6.55 billion. The administration is also fighting to hold down spending on other measures pending before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, including anti-drug legislation, trade legislation and aid for the hungry and homeless. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said if all of those measures were adopted, the 1989 deficit would increase by between $ 6.4 billion and $ 8.7 billion, enough even at the low end of the estimate to trigger the spending cuts. `` We ca n't do all the things that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has on its list right now,'' he told reporters during a White House briefing. `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has got to pare down and make sure it does n't go over these limits.'' <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, D-Pa., agreed that the administration's mid-session budget review showed `` we may be moving uncomfortably close'' to automatic spending cuts `` It is clear from this report that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the administration will have to make difficult choices in the months ahead. All of the urgent needs of the nation can not be funded at the levels most of us would support in less difficult times,'' <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> said. Under the Gramm-Rudman act, the administration is required to estimate the coming year's fiscal budget deficit by mid-August. The White House budget office must then adjust that estimate in October to take into account any new legislation. If such legislation pushes the deficit past the trigger amount of $ 146 billion, automatic spending cuts of more than $ 10 billion automatically take effect in October, right before the fall elections, with half of the cuts taken out of domestic spending and half out of military spending. The administration's new budget estimates, which are based on updated economic and spending projections, predicted that the deficit in the current fiscal year would be $ 152.3 billion. This is slightly higher than the $ 146.7 billion deficit estimate the administration made in February, but it is still well below the deficit estimates of $ 160 billion or more that were being made by many private economists at the time. Better-than-expected economic growth, which has pushed the unemployment rate down to a 14-year-low and boosted government tax revenues, was credited for lowering the shortfall. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a private consulting firm, said his current estimates were close to the administration's forecasts for this year and next year. The 1987 budget deficit was $ 150.4 billion as a one-time windfall from tax overhaul resulted in a big improvement from the $ 221.1 billion record deficit suffered in 1986. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, noting that the administration's original forecast was scorned as a `` rosy scenario,'' blamed higher spending in such areas as deposit insurance for missing the administration's February target The budget review said that the bank and savings and loan insurance funds would pay out $ 4.6 billion more this year than had been originally budgeted because of high failure rates at financial institutions in the depressed <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION>. The deficit target under the Gramm-Rudman legislation for the upcoming fiscal year is $ 136 billion, but the legislation says automatic spending cuts can be avoided if the government's deficit projection is within $ 10 billion of that figure. Thus, for 1989, any estimate below $ 146 billion would avoid the need for spending cuts.

 An arson forest fire that has burned into the western edges of this city expanded and switched direction Thursday and more subdivisions were ordered evacuated, officials said. `` It's out of control. It has expanded drastically since I was there last evening,'' Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mickelson </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, efforts to block a fire burning toward Old Faithful geyser in Yellowstone National Park were hampered by what normally would be good firefighting weather _ cool, damp conditions slowed a backfire intended to head off one of seven major fires. Fires also burned in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state. Three subdivisions in western <LOCATION> Rapid </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> were ordered evacuated Thursday as a precaution as wind whipped a fire in the heavily forested <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>. Later Thursday, officials suggested that residents leave another rural housing area. Reports that the fire was arson brought strong reaction from residents. `` I ca n't believe there's people that sick,'' said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Norton </PERSON>, who could n't return home after a dental appointment because of the evacuation order. `` It floors me to think that someone could cause that much destruction and devastaton to so many people. Fire officials did not know how many homes were involved but said the number was in the hundreds. `` It's almost being defended totally by air at the present time because it is in those canyons and the ground crews simply can not fight the fire,'' <PERSON> Mickelson </PERSON> said in an interview from his office in <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON>. The wind switched from the southeast to the north during the morning and gained speed, he said. That combined with a forecast high of 100 degrees `` does not bode well for fighting the fire,'' the governor said. The fire had been declared 70 percent contained by late Thursday after burning an estimated 2,800 acres. Fifteen homes, 32 outbuildings, 14 vehicles and a bridge had been destroyed. Earlier Thursday, about half of the 1,000 people who were told to leave their homes Wednesday were allowed to return. <PERSON> Mickelson </PERSON> was at the scene Wednesday and saw a barn and a house catch fire no more than 200 yards away. The buildings were engulfed in seconds. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Kopp </PERSON>, the fire incident commander, said Wednesday that the fire was the work of an arsonist. And he said authorities have been investigating a series of about 50 fires dating back to May that are believed to have been started by the same person. A 14-year-old boy was arrested in <LOCATION> Rapid </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> after a small fire was reported on a ridge overlooking the town. But police said they did not think he was responsible for setting the main fire on Tuesday. Fires inside <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> had charred 95,135 acres by Thursday evening, about 4 percent of the park's 2.2 million acres. Although cooler temperatures, higher humidity and scattered showers aided fire control efforts, the conditions created problems for firefighters attempting to start a 6-mile backfire along the eastern edge of the 8,500-acre North Fork fire that was within six miles of Old Faithful. But the same conditions helped firefighters outside the park and officials in the <LOCATION> Bridger-Teton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION> prepared to release some of the 690 firefighters battling the 24,400-acre Mink Creek fire in the forest's <LOCATION> Teton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wilderness </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldapfel </PERSON>, fire information officer. The seven major fires in the park have not discouraged tourists from visiting the famous Old Faithful geyser, as hundreds have been gathering to watch its regular eruptions. Officials continued to stress Thursday that the Old Faithful complex around the geyser was in no danger from the fire. The complex consists of three lodges providing 521 rooms, including the Old Faithful Inn, which is on the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION>'s list of national historic landmarks Other services at Old Faithful include a general store and two service stations. Controversy continued over the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s so-called `` let it burn'' philosophy. The <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> prefers its action to be called fire management, saying fires are a natural part of a healthy forest. Park naturalist ranger <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Buss </PERSON> said the last time the park burned `` very badly was back in the 1600s.'' Tons of fallen timber, fast-growing brush, trees killed by pine beetle and nearly 100 years of fire suppression have kept an elderly forest intact as a likely fire victim, park officials said. `` A forest that is 200-to-300-years old is more or less preparing its own funeral pyre,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Varley </PERSON>, a park scientist. Five more families left their homes early Thursday in western <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> when the Madison Gulch fire grew to about 900 acres in the <ORGANIZATION> Lolo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>. About 50 people left their homes in the area Wednesday as a precaution from areas near <LOCATION> Alberton </LOCATION>, a town of 300 on the <LOCATION> Clark </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fork </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> about 35 miles west of <LOCATION> Missoula </LOCATION>. There were 51 wind-whipped fires burning across <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>; firefighters were battling only 16 of them. <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockwell </PERSON> said fires this summer have blackened 1.4 million acres in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. Ten families remained out of their homes in the area of the 3,000-acre <LOCATION> Willis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulch </LOCATION> fire northeast of <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, and the state imposed strict fire restrictions, due to go into effect at midnight, on government land throughout the dry southern part of the state. In <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, firefighters were working on scores of small fires throughout the <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, most of them caused by lightning. But a fire that burned about 30 acres Wednesday near <LOCATION> Coulterville </LOCATION>, destroying four structures and forcing the evacuation of up to 70 homes, was blamed on a careless 13-year-old smoker.

No immediate reaction came from South Korean officials. Last week, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> proposed that legislators from the two Koreas meet in <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION>, the North's capital, to discuss a non-agression pact. In a second letter Tuesday, it said it was ready to consider ending its boycott and entering the Olympics if the South would consider its demand to act as host at the Games. South Korean officials have said they were studying the letters and would respond `` affirmatively,'' but they want to meet in the truce village of <LOCATION> Panmunjon </LOCATION> in the Demilitarized Zone that divides the two Koreas. Said <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>: `` These days, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is reinforcing massive armed forces in and around <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> on the plea of guaranteeing ` Olympic safety,' and at the instigation of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> authorities are maneuvering more blatantly than ever to keep our nation divided forever. `` What is needed ... is a dialogue for great national unity and reunification ... and the co-hosting of the Olympics,'' <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> said. The International Olympic Committee has rejected <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s demand to act as co-host at the Games, saying they are awarded to only one city The <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> was divided into communist North and pro-West, capitalist South in 1945 at the end of World War II. The two halves fought the bloody Korean War from 1950 to 1953 and remain bitter rivals. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> added without elaborating that `` the standing committee of our <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> has decided to send a letter of proposal to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for negotiations.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> approved a reshuffled Cabinet on Thursday to help Premier <PERSON> Branko </PERSON> <PERSON> Mikulic </PERSON> fight <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s worst economic crisis. During the parliamentary session, Vice Premier <PERSON> Janez </PERSON> <PERSON> Zemljaric </PERSON> defended a government austerity program introduced in May. The program has set off a wave of workers' protest strikes nationwide over wages and inflation. <PERSON> Mikulic </PERSON> survived calls for his resignation in May when <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> decided against voting on no-confidence motions submitted by the nation's two most economically developed republics, <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Croatia </LOCATION>. He promised then to reconstruct his Cabinet to promote more capable people. Mikulic picked <PERSON> Radoslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Bohinc </PERSON>, a former deputy economy minister of <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>, as federal minister of economy, a new Cabinet post. Franc <PERSON> Horvat </PERSON>, also from <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>, replaced <PERSON> Miodrag </PERSON> <PERSON> Mirovic </PERSON>, from <LOCATION> Montenegro </LOCATION>, as new minister of tourism. <PERSON> Dragi </PERSON> <PERSON> Donev </PERSON>, minister without portfolio from the southern republic of <LOCATION> Macedonia </LOCATION>, was elected as minister of transport.

<HEAD>Wedtech Prosecutor: Defense Attacks on Meese are a Smokescreen</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A federal prosecutor ridiculed defense tactics at the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> corruption trial Thursday, saying they were a bid to cloud the case with allegations against Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. Rep. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, and six others on trial since mid-March are charged with a racketeering conspiracy that allegedly turned <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> into a vehicle for bribery and kickbacks. Prosecutors claim <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>, a now-defunct military contractor, grew into a multimillion-dollar concern by committing fraud against a government program that set aside contracts for minority-owned businesses. A key element of the defense case, however, was the claim that corrupt <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> executives had connections to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> White House insiders like <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> and did not need to buy <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>'s influence to obtain the no-bid defense contracts. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, in a day-long rebuttal of the defense's closing arguments, compared the so-called `` Meese defense'' to a squid that `` squirts black ink into the sea, eveything gets cloudy, everything gets muddy. `` It's impossible to see the creature and he escapes,'' said <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, adding that his admittedly `` silly parable'' showed `` what so much of the defense in this case has been.'' He compared it to `` a squid under attack. Talk about something else. Do n't talk about the facts. Create a diversion and a smokescreen so there's a lot of ink and muddy waters.'' In his closing argument Thursday, <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> LaRossa </PERSON> said <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> was `` at the core of the conspiracy'' and accused the attorney general of orchestrating corruption by investigating <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>'s competitors while allowing the company to pay his legal fees during his confirmation hearings in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Another prosecutor, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. Little, shocked the courtroom last week when he conceded in his summation that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> `` was a sleaze'' but said his activities had no bearing on the guilt or innocence of <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> and his co-defendants. In his rebuttal argument, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> hammered at that point. `` The biggest smokescreen or diversion in this case _ to protect them -LRB- the defendants -RRB- from the truth _ is <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> was under scrutiny for some time because of his <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> connections, but a special prosecutor in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>, determined there was insufficient evidence to charge <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> with wrongdoing. However, <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> questioned the attorney general's ethics on several issues <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> has said he will leave office later this summer. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Constance </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> Motley </PERSON> was to instruct the jury on the law governing its deliberations Friday, before it began weighing evidence in the four-month-old trial. <PERSON> Motley </PERSON>'s charge to the jury was expected to last all day.

 <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> appealed to <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> on Thursday to investigate reported massacres of hundreds of civilians by government forces fighting rebels. The London-based human rights group also called on Prime Minister <PERSON> Sadek </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON>'s government to repeal amputation and flogging as legal penalties. In a 10-page report, <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> urged <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> to `` take firm measures to assert the rule of law'' and establish independent inquries into reported massacres in the southern part of the East African nation. The report followed a letter the group sent to <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> in May outlining its concerns over reported human rights abuses. Amnesty said it received no reply. The Sudanese People's <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, based in the Christian and animist south, has waged a guerrilla war against Moslem-dominated governments in the northern capital of <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> since 1983. The rebels oppose Islamic law, introduced by ousted President <PERSON> Gafaar </PERSON> <PERSON> Nimeiri </PERSON>, which imposes amputation and flogging for certain offenses, <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said. No amputations have been carried out since the military toppled <PERSON> Nimeiri </PERSON> while he was visiting <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in 1985, but floggings continue and courts still pass amputation sentences, the report said. Massacres of unarmed civilians have taken place `` apparently because they belonged to an ethnic group regarded as sympathetic to or supportive of the -LRB- rebels -RRB-,'' it said. Soldiers and militiamen reportedly massacred 1,000 to 2,000 <ORGANIZATION> Dinka </ORGANIZATION> tribesmen in the town of <LOCATION> Wau </LOCATION> in August and September 1987, it said. Hundreds of other <LOCATION> Dinka </LOCATION> civilians were burned to death by mobs in the town of Ad-Daien when police failed to intervene, the report said. Relief agencies have estimated that fighting has displaced up to half the 6 million residents of the south, the report said. Hundreds of thousands of them fled to neighboring <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, where the government is fighting its own civil war against rebels in the north.

 The morning after someone burned down <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartford </PERSON>'s home, friends and neighbors came by to offer help and sympathy. Standing in the ashes of all he'd lost, he found himself wondering if any of them had lit the match. `` People are coming by and you think, ` I wonder if it's Jim or <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> or <PERSON> Bill </PERSON>,' `` <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> said. Fifteen unsolved arsons since May 5 have reduced the town of 850 to waves of rumor and fearful speculation about everyone. Knowing that most of the fires have been set around midnight or 1 a.m., many residents do n't leave their houses after dark. In most homes, someone keeps watch through the night. In many, there's a gun near the door. Morning talk in the Old Corner Store drifts to how many days have passed since the last fire. `` People in town have changed,'' said <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON>, whose family escaped its burning house when her husband heard something in the yard and smelled smoke. `` Everybody used to be very happy and smiling, laughing, talking. Now it's long faces, tired, nervous.'' The town, 125 miles north of <LOCATION> Concord </LOCATION>, is `` on the defensive now,'' <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> said. `` People are staying pretty much to themselves because no one knows who it is.'' `` It could be one of your best friends, someone you've known for years and never suspected,'' <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON> agreed. By daylight, <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON>'s 100 square miles of fields, forests and back roads nestle in the shadow of the <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>' Presidential Range Tourists on their way from <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> pass through the village's three blocks, where they find the Old Corner Store, three gas stations, a post office and public library and little more. With no local industry, most residents commute to nearby towns for work. About 30 volunteers make up the fire department. <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> has no police force. The town depends on state police in <LOCATION> Twin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION>, about 12 miles away. `` You see someone who looks haggard and drawn in the corner store on Sunday morning and you know it's because they were up all night,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON>, a state senator. `` We're not unlike the hostages in a hijacking. It's a feeling of helplessness.'' The fires that began in fields and brush escalated to barns, unoccupied houses and two occupied homes. Back roads and main routes alike are dotted with blackened shells and foundations. One of the burned homes is 1 -LCB- blocks from the fire station. No one has been injured in the fires. Authorities have said most of the fires began at the back of the buildings and most were set late at night. They've refused to divulge other details. Finding patterns is the key to finding the arsonist, according to experts. `` There is always a pattern. It may be as illogical as you can imagine,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, who after 23 years with the the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> Fire Department began his own fire investigating firm. <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahart </PERSON>, executive secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigators </ORGANIZATION>, said patterns can be found in the time of day, the day of the week, the location, the method and other details. `` A serial arsonist will progress,'' <PERSON> Ahart </PERSON> said. `` He'll work his way up the ladder. Little fires become bigger fires and bigger fires become yet bigger fires. As they get bolder and more accustomed to what they're doing, whatever drives them to do this becomes a bigger need or addiction.'' Plainclothes state policemen driving unmarked cars now patrol <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON>, and investigators have asked the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> to try to develop a psychological profile of the fire starter. A member of the state fire marshal's office has moved to town. At least 200 people attended a recent town meeting called by state police to calm residents' fears. The <ORGANIZATION> Jefferson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firemen </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> has offered a $ 5,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of whoever is responsible. At <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>'s burned-out house, the reward poster sits amid flower pots that stood in what was the dooryard. He and his wife, son and stepdaughter scrambled out a bathroom window onto a roof and down a ladder to escape the fire that broke out at about 1:15 a.m. They lost everything. A 5-month-old <PERSON> Springer </PERSON> spaniel and a cat did n't make it out. <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>'s wife, <PERSON> Donna </PERSON>, and her daughter wo n't sleep at night unless someone is awake, he said. Blueprints already are drawn for another home on the site, but the new house will be only one story _ easier to escape. `` It's tough to live this way right now,'' said <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, 43, who manages a building materials store in nearby <LOCATION> Littleton </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON>, `` before this started, was a very cohesive town, a traditional, small town where everyone would look out for each other,'' said <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, a local innkeeper. While closeness remains, `` you look over your shoulder, you are suspicious of your neighbor. It may break some bonds.'' State police Lt. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said people `` are attempting to protect their own property, and we have word that people are establishing their own citizen patrols late at night to identify this individual.'' He has encouraged residents instead to call police with anything unusual. Mrs. <PERSON> Hartford </PERSON> told a story about a man who got a flat tire while driving late at night, but was afraid to leave his car until daylight. Another resident recounted how a plainclothes policeman emerged from the woods near a barn and was met by three people with guns trained on him. `` I would n't walk this street when it starts getting dark,'' <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON> said. It's difficult to convince people who feel their lives are threatened not to take action, Mrs. <PERSON> Hartford </PERSON> said. `` We're all frightened to death,'' she said. `` We do n't want to hurt anyone, but we want to protect what's rightfully ours.'' Perhaps the intensity of the investigation will drive the arsonist to leave or to stop setting fires for a time, leaving residents with only their fear. `` I've heard many people say they are not going to sleep again until this person is caught,'' said innkeeper <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>.

 You know how you'll be standing in the grocery checkout line and you'll pick up one of those tabloids with the screaming headlines? And the story inside never lives up to the promise on the cover? <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> has turned that kind of an idea into a television show, `` The Reporters,'' making its debut Saturday. True, there are no stories, at least in the premiere, about aliens from outer space or two-headed babies. But the first installment does tease with the promise to `` answer the nagging question _ is <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> a homosexual?'' Never mind that no one who screened the show at the TV critics' convention here could recall ever hearing the `` nagging question,'' what seemed immediately more interesting than the answer was what happened to the person who asked Reporter <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunleavy </PERSON> did put the question to <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>, after a fashion, but the program never gives the promised answer, other than <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>'s mumble about such rumors being typical when you have all the money and women. Otherwise, <PERSON> Dunleavy </PERSON>'s piece is a rambling profile that reveals little that is new about the heavyweight champ. `` The Reporters'' begins with a dramatic, fast-paced opening similar to <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` West 57th.'' What follows is n't really a news show, though the reporters from `` The Reporters `` defended it as such during a heated presentation to television critics. Earlier in the week, the same critics got a peek at <ORGANIZATION> GTG </ORGANIZATION>'s syndicated magazine show, `` USA Today: The Television Show. Questions about its `` Entertainment Tonight'' - style of happy talk paled next to `` The Reporters,'' which makes `` USA Today: The Television Show'' look like `` CBS Reports'' by comparison On `` The Reporters,'' the reporters make less-than-subtle statements of their own conclusions about their stories. Getting the other side _ or at least presenting it to viewers _ seems an alien concept. <PERSON> Dunleavy </PERSON> even suggested there was no difference between his editorializing in the Tyson piece and the commentary written by the TV critics who were questioning his tactics. He did n't seem to grasp the difference between clearly labeled opinion and something presented as objective reportage. For instance, after <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> tells <PERSON> Dunleavy </PERSON> he'd do something `` irrational'' to anyone who threatened his wife, <PERSON> Dunleavy </PERSON> gushes in voiceover, `` And believe me, he means it!'' <PERSON> Dunleavy </PERSON> is a veteran of <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON> <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON>'s tabloids in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and more recently worked at the Star and the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> owns <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Dunleavy </PERSON> is also seen on <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>'s syndicated news show, `` A Current Affair. `` The Reporters'' is from the same people who do `` A Current Affair,'' but that show somehow has an edge of wink-wink, nudge-nudge, thanks in part to host <PERSON> Maury </PERSON> <PERSON> Povich </PERSON>, that is lacking in the deadly serious and self-important `` The Reporters.'' <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Abramovitz </PERSON>, another of `` The Reporters'' who is also a veteran of `` A Current Affair'' became angry at the TV critics, at one point explaining his cracking voice _ `` I'm trembling, because I'm offended!'' Besides the Tyson piece, critics took exception to a story in which reporter <PERSON> Krista </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON> helped a Taiwanese student legalize her alien status and avoid deportation. In the final scene, <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON> shows the girl a tape of an interview with a government official agreeing to let her stay in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

CBS' Dan Rather had some emotional encounters with traumatized <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans for a recent network documentary and the network took the veterans to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. But somehow it all served to illustrate the issue without becoming embarrassingly self-conscious. <PERSON> Abramovitz </PERSON> disagreed. `` If you think they -LRB- the networks -RRB- work a story any differently than we do, they're a lot better at pulling the wool over your eyes than we are, `` he said. `` I think we can display emotion without commenting on the issues,'' said <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON>. `` I agree it's a fine line, and I'm happy with where I have placed it.'' <PERSON> Abramovitz </PERSON> called the show `` first-rate journalism.'' `` We used to have a trick. We used to hide all these things and make it look like ` objective journalism,''' he said. `` I think it's time to come out in the open and tell it like it is ` We're going to be doing stories about real people in a real way and we're not going to confuse people about what's on the screen or what's in our minds.'' The critics did n't get to screen <PERSON> Abramovitz </PERSON>'s piece for the premiere show; the story, called `` The Actress and the Dwarf,'' was still being edited. The reporters on `` The Reporters'' might have a point about elitism. Low-brow entertainment has its place, and who does n't have a guilty pleasure? Viewed as unintentional spoof of the `` 60 Minutes'' genre, `` The Reporters'' is not bad entertainment. But calling it an objective news show is a little scary.

 The story appeared in the sports section. But like many a modern sports story, it was about finance and economics, too. After a prolonged negotiation, <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Cadigan </PERSON>, the first round draft choice of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jets </ORGANIZATION> football team, had signed a $ 2 million contract. The sticking point, according to news accounts, had been that <PERSON> Cadigan </PERSON> and his lawyer wanted most of the $ 850,000 signing bonus paid in 1988, while the maximum income tax rate is 28 percent. `` <PERSON> Cadigan </PERSON> wanted to receive a larger portion of his overall bonus this year, as the maximum rate could go up in succeeding years,'' the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported. There is a lot of that going around these days _ a sense that some long-outstanding bills will soon come due for many Americans as individuals and the country as a whole. When analysts listen to campaign promises from either party this year, they react with more than the customary skepticism. How, they ask, is anybody going to pay for these goodies when the government is already shoulder-deep in debt? `` Stop kidding us,'' says the current issue of Fortune magazine, chastising the presidential candidates for playing down the question of a tax increase. `` Everybody knows that for the deficit to come down, taxes must go up.'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, who publishes the newsletter Brennan Reports on tax and investment planning, is giving advice very similar to what <PERSON> Cadigan </PERSON> got from his attorney. Normally, <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> says, savvy taxpayers begin around this time of year figuring out how to defer as much income as possible past New Year's Day, in order to reduce the tax bills they will face. `` In the past, planning was usually concentrated on deferring income _ that's no longer true!'' he observes. `` There may be cases where income should be accelerated into 1988, while tax rates are low. In the future, a 28 percent or 33 percent rate may be pretty appetizing when we look back to 1988.'' It is less than two years since <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> overhauled the income tax system, curbing or eliminating many tax deductions. The legislators were able to sell the bill to the public by lowering tax rates. So you might expect cries of outrage at talk of raising those rates again. But there are other forces at work as well. One is the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings bill, also enacted in 1986, that mandates across-the-board cuts in spending for government programs unless specific goals are met toward balancing the federal budget. In this election year, says <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON> <PERSON> Pecarich </PERSON>, director of tax policy at the accounting firm of <ORGANIZATION> Coopers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lybrand </ORGANIZATION>, policymakers probably can dodge the Gramm-Rudman ax with some imaginative maneuvering and optimistic assumptions. `` Next year will be a different story,'' she says. Then there are the stirrings of inflation that lately have troubled Wall Street _ and that <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, has spoken of with unusually candid concern. These inflation worries arise out of a vibrant economy in which industry is enjoying a renascence and unemployment has fallen to a 14-year low. But that near-boom has been financed to a great extent with other people's money _ in many cases, money borrowed from foreign investors to pay for goods made by foreign manufacturers. `` There is very good momentum in the economy right now,'' says <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Boltz </PERSON>, financial economist at the investment management firm of <ORGANIZATION> T. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rowe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Price </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>. However, he adds, `` We have n't started to pay for this party. And we wo n't until we have a trade surplus.''

 They stood on their heads and yodeled. They smushed marshmallows in their mouths and chanted, `` Chubby bunny, chubby bunny, chubby bunny.'' They dressed as Uncle <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> and tapped danced on stilts. They were weird. But they had a purpose. More than 100 people staged their weirdest acts last week for a chance to be seen on the big screen with a guy who proudly bills himself as `` Weird Al.'' His real name is <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Yankovic </PERSON>, a 27-year-old Southern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> native who hit the big time in 1983 with a song called `` Another One Rides the Bus.'' It was his way of laughing at pop culture _ the song is a parody of the rock group Queen's hit song, `` Another One Bites the Dust.'' He's been laughing his way to the bank ever since. Five albumns later, Weird Al is on the radio and video music stations again laughing at pop culture, this time with `` I'm Fat'' from his `` Even Worse'' albumn. The song and LP is a takeoff on <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s `` I'm Bad'' from the `` Bad'' album. `` Most of the songs I do are about food or TV _ two of the things that have shaped my life most,'' <PERSON> Yankovic </PERSON> said. Five years later, Weird Al is still, well, weird. And he's making a full-length feature film to prove it called `` U H F,'' due for release next summer Shooting was to begin in early August in <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION>. `` It feels kind of cold and clammy,'' said the former college disc jockey. `` It's a lot harder to be funny for an hour and a half than it is for three or four minutes,'' he said, referring to his work with music videos. Ten years ago, <PERSON> Yankovic </PERSON> was an architecture student at <ORGANIZATION> Cal-Poly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Obispo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. He left with a degree and moved on to develop Weird Al. Now he has a movie deal to film the screenplay he and longtime friend and manager <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Levey </PERSON> finished in 1983. `` The character that I play is going to be somewhat like Weird Al,'' <PERSON> Yankovic </PERSON> said. `` But this is n't going to be ` Weird <PERSON> Al </PERSON>'s Big Adventure.''' `` The movie is a cross between ` It's a Wonderful Life,' ` The <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chainsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massacre </ORGANIZATION>' and ` Purple Rain,''' said <PERSON> Levey </PERSON>, who is directing the film. `` It's a love story.'' OK, not really. <PERSON> Yankovic </PERSON>'s character, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>, owns a UHF TV station and turns it into the hottest thing around by putting on nice, wholesome, weird programming. <PERSON> Levey </PERSON> began managing <PERSON> Yankovic </PERSON>'s career `` from his inception.. when he was an embryo.'' He also has directed the Weird Al videos, a change of pace from directing `` U H F,'' his first feature film. `` I just kind of fell into directing. Shooting music videos is kamikaze work. You have two days to do four days of work,'' <PERSON> Levey </PERSON> said. `` The pacing is not quite so deadly in film.'' The Tulsa auditions were an open call for acts that may be used later during the eight-week filming schedule when staging a telethon to save <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>'s station, <PERSON> Levey </PERSON> said. `` They came at us for five hours. They were all so strange,'' he said. `` It's hard to describe them without sounding ridiculous. But they were all great.'' The movie is being filmed in <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION> because it's `` the perfect <LOCATION> Anytown </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Levey </PERSON> said. `` And that's meant as a very affectionate compliment to <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION>.'' Executive producer <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> <PERSON> Frederickson </PERSON> suggested <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION> as a film location after his experience here in 1982 while shooting `` The Outsiders.'' And having a chance to come back home makes working in the state more desirable, he said. `` This is repeat business, so that's great,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Nell </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Oklahoma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>. `` U H F'' is the fourth motion picture filmed in the state this year. `` The Killing Device'' was filmed in <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION> in April, `` The Bounty Hunter'' in <LOCATION> Sand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> in May and portions of `` Rainman'' in <LOCATION> Guthrie </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hinton </PERSON> and <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Reno </PERSON> in June. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said she is able to sell the state to film companies because of the varied location work that is available. `` I always tell them about the varied terrain. I've hyped that so much now that I think they believe me.'' Television, video and full-length feature filming in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> brought in about $ 50 million last year, <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Drought Bites Into Cherry Pies and Bean Soup, Too</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Drought has taken its toll on beans, peas and other food crops as well as chewing away at big-ticket items like corn, soybeans and spring wheat, says the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` The drought's greatest impacts on fruit and vegetable crops are likely to be on dry edible beans, tart cherries, green peas, sweet corn, and snap beans for canning,'' says economist <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Zepp </PERSON>. `` <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> produce about 50 percent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sweet corn and green peas, much of which is on non-irrigated acreage,'' he says. `` <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> produces about 40 percent of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> snap bean output, about half of which is grown on non-irrigated acreage.'' The production of vegetables grown for the fresh market tends to be concentrated on irrigated land, so the drought impact has not been so great. <PERSON> Zepp </PERSON>, writing in the August issue of Agricultural Outlook magazine, provided an appraisal of how the hot weather and drought has affected several high-value crops. Here's a summary of his analysis:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>CANNED VEGETABLES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Midwestern output of green peas is about 50 percent below normal. Sweet corn and green beans are harvested later in the summer, and production depends on rainfall in the remainder of the season. Canners expect Midwestern sweet corn and green bean production to be only 70 percent to 75 percent of what had been planned, and carrot and beet production is expected to be 60 percent to 65 percent. Canners boosted prices of peas, sweet corn and snap beans by 10 percent to 20 percent in June because of anticipated production shortfalls. Most of the corn, peas and beans grown in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> are for canning. Vegetables for freezing are concentrated in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION>, where water for irrigation generally has been adequate for vegetable production this summer.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>POTATOES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Hot, dry weather in June hurt development of potatoes across the Northcentral states, reducing stands and stressing plants. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> estimates 1988 total potato acreage at 1.27 million acres, down 2 percent from last year. The area for fall harvest is estimated at 1.06 million acres, down 3 percent from last year. The large 1987 fall crop resulted in generally lower prices, causing farmers to reduce acreage this season.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>SWEET POTATOES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Growers planted 93,900 acres of sweet potatoes for 1988, down 3 percent from last year. The biggest change was in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, where acreage dropped nearly 11 percent from 1987. Dry soils delayed planting.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>DRY EDIBLE BEANS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Drought appears to have contributed to a 36 percent cut in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s dry bean acreage this year, since most of the crop is on non-irrigated land. Dry weather delayed plantings in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, which increased the chance of frost damage this fall before the crop is mature. Also, some growers shifted dry bean acreage to soybeans, hoping for higher returns. <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> grows mainly navy beans, accounting for about 60 percent of last year's navy bean harvest nationwide. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> bean prices rose nearly 40 percent during the third week of June because of anticipated drought losses and smaller supplies. The July estimate of area for harvest for all types of dry beans was 1.51 million acres, down 13 percent from last year. In addition to the decline in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, large acreage reductions were reported for <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, on the other hand, reported 21,000 acres more for harvest than in 1987.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>APPLES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Production is forecast at 8.07 billion pounds this year, down 23 percent from the 1987 apple harvest. All regions expect smaller production. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state, the stress on trees from last year's record crop and this year's varied bloom and set contributed to reduced prospects. Trees in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION> region suffered from some winter damage, and <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s crop is expected to be smaller because of spring freezes and drought.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>GRAPES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> total grape harvest is forecast at 4.7 million tons, up 1 percent from last season. Raisin-type grape output is forecast at 2.15 million tons, down 2 percent from last year. Some irrigators have had water allocations scaled back, and many have switched to costly pumping of well water. Production of table-type grapes in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> is forecast at 600,000 tons, up 18 percent from last year. Tight water supplies have not affected table grape production, and growers are reporting heavy yields. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> wine grape production is forecast at 1.95 million tons, the same as last year. Drought has had little effect so far, but some acreage may undergo stress as irrigation water runs out.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>TART CHERRIES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Production is forecast at 207 million pounds, down 42 percent from 1987. Production in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, the largest cherry producer, was off 43 percent. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s output is down 34 percent from last year.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>TOBACCO</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 The total <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tobacco area for harvest in 1988 is estimated at 624,000 acres, up 6 percent from last year. Both flue-cured and burley showed increases, reflecting higher effective quotas for 1988. Moisture has been adequate for plant growth in much of the flue-cured belt, and yield prospects look good. But dryer conditions prevailed in the burley area, so yields likely will be reduced.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>SUGAR BEETS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Estimated plantings of sugar beets were put at 1.32 million acres, up 4 percent from last season. The acreage was up in all major growing areas except <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. However, dry conditions resulted in poor germination, requiring growers to replant some fields several times. According to industry sources, more than 250,000 acres, mostly in the <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, had to be replanted. In some cases, farmers may have switched to other crops having a shorter growing season or requiring less soil moisture for seed germination. According to <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> analysts, sugar beet production will be substantially below last year's near-record harvest, while cane output may equal or exceed last year's level.

 Investors who jumped into the agricultural commodity markets when the Midwestern drought became apparent last spring have been scrambling for the exit doors since the weather changed for the wetter, experts say. With crop conditions either static or improving, prices for future delivery of grains and soybeans have fallen precipitously. The drop in crop futures prices has spilled over into the livestock and sugar futures markets, and has prompted some economists to lower their month-old projections for 1989 food inflation from about 7 percent to 6 percent or less.

The government reported that the growth rate in the gross national product, the economy's total output of goods and services, was down only slightly from a revised 3.4 percent increase in the first three months of the year. But inflation, as measured by a price index tied to the GNP, registered the biggest advance since the third quarter of 1982. The GNP price index had risen at a 3.5 percent rate in the first quarter. The White House dismissed the inflation figure as a temporary deviation, but some private economists said the current long economic recovery may be coming to an end, setting the stage for a recession some time next year. `` We have had a definite upturn in the inflation rate which is a by-product of our long expansion,'' said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` The demand side of our economy is now exceeding our ability to produce, which is causing price pressures.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> already has pushed interest rates higher as a way of dampening demand and <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said the central bank would tighten further if inflationary pressures did not abate. In the bond market, the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s closely watched 30-year bond lost about $ 5.60 for every $ 1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves inversely to its price and is often an indicator of interest rate trends, jumped to 9.23 percent from 9.18 percent late Tuesday. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 20.27 to 2,053.70, its lowest close since it stood at 2,052.45 on June 2. The dollar finished lower against most major currencies, while crop futures closed mixed on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> as late jitters about next week's weather offset a rally that analysts said was long overdue.

<HEAD>Giant Japanese Securities Firm To Buy Stake in Investment Boutique</HEAD>

 <PERSON> Wasserstein </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Perella </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s agreement to sell a 20 percent stake to giant <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 100 million represents a coup that could win the aggressive, young firm an ever bigger share of the lucrative international merger and acquisitions business. Other cash-rich Japanese companies have bought into large, established, capital-hungry Wall Street firms. But the investment by <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> _ <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s biggest securities house _ represents a relatively more potent capital boost to the small, six-month-old investment boutique. <PERSON> Wasserstein </PERSON> <PERSON> Perella </PERSON> was formed in February by two leaders of <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s highly successful mergers and acquisitions operation, who quit to start their own firm. Under an agreement announced Wednesday, the two firms plan to work together on mergers and acquisitions involving Japanese, American and European companies. The transactions are expected to be handled through a joint venture company. `` This will be a very good source of business for our firm, and -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION>'s -RRB- knowledge of the Japanese market is a real advantage to our clients who are looking to sell assets to Japanese buyers,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Biondi </PERSON>, a vice president at <PERSON> Wasserstein </PERSON> <PERSON> Perella </PERSON>. Tokyo-based <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> had 1987 profits totaling $ 2.13 billion and a market capitalization in excess of $ 56 billion. <PERSON> Yoshihisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Tabuchi </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION>'s president and chief executive, said the affiliation `` will provide our clients with unique benefits in execution skills and strategic insight in the global mergers and acquisitions marketplace.'' Japanese companies long have had a keen interest in the fast-paced <ORGANIZATION> M </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; A business that has evolved in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. At the same time, Wall Street firms hungry for new sources of capital increasingly have turned to foreign partners. In late 1986 <ORGANIZATION> Sumitomo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> paid $ 500 million for a non-voting stake in <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Last year <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> acquired a 13 percent stake in <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 538 million And also in 1987, <ORGANIZATION> Yasuda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mutual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> agreed to pay $ 300 million for an 18 percent stake in <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. On Tuesday, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s fourth-largest securities house, <ORGANIZATION> Yamaichi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, agreed to acquire a 25 percent equity interest in <ORGANIZATION> Lodestar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a small <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> merger and acquisitions firm headed by <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, former M & amp; A head for <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. <ORGANIZATION> Yamaichi </ORGANIZATION> also invested $ 100 million in Lodestar's corporate buyout <PERSON> Biondi </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> made the investment for strategic reasons. `` They want to be an important factor in the global M & amp; A market _ they want to learn and be in partnership with someone who is perceived as a very high-quality provider of M & amp; A advice,'' he said. One source on Wall Street said the deal ensures <PERSON> Wasserstein </PERSON> <PERSON> Perella </PERSON> `` gets all the advantages of having the pockets of a major player in the financial markets, while <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> gets access to an enviable flow of deals.'' Indeed, <PERSON> Wasserstein </PERSON> <PERSON> Perella </PERSON> has represented such major players as <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Beatrice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The firm, with offices in four <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cities and in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, has advised clients on transactions valued at more than $ 19 billion since its inception. <PERSON> Biondi </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION>'s contribution was the first `` outside money'' the young investment firm had raised. `` Until now we were 100 percent owned by employee shareholders,'' he said. <PERSON> Wasserstein </PERSON> <PERSON> Perella </PERSON> has $ 500 million earmarked for leveraged buyouts and expects to raise further capital for the buyout fund. <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION>'s contribution will be a substantial boost to the firm's operating capital, <PERSON> Biondi </PERSON> said In a statement announcing the <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> deal, the firm stressed that while its goal was to be a major player in mergers and acquisitions, it did not want to amass a huge staff. That would prevent potential problems inherent with a big workroll, such as conflicts of interest, while sharply boosting the potential profits for the firm's partners. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Wasserstein </PERSON>, president and chief executive, and his partner, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Perella </PERSON>, the firm's chairman, were in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and could not be reached for comment. The pair stunned the investment community in February when they left <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION>, the investment house they helped propel to the top ranks in the mergers and acquisition business. A string of other <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> professionals resigned to follow them, taking a toll on the venerable investment house. The takeover team they headed was believed to have brought in more than $ 350 million in mergers and acquisition revenue in 1987 alone, and some analysts estimated the duo was responsible for half of <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION>'s 1987 profits.

 The nation's biggest hospital industry group is calling for caution in <ORGANIZATION> Prudential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s revolutionary plan to direct policyholders to have major organ transplants at hospitals it believes have the best survivability rates The giant insurance company's plan, announced Wednesday, could mark a break with tradition that leaves the choice of hospital up to patient and physician, but is seen as helping to hold down rising health care costs. But <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> McPherson </PERSON>, vice president for group health care at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said hospital ratings based on statistics should not be the sole criteria for judging quality care. `` It is important for them to disclose their quality criteria, how that quality criteria was designated, what the connections are in terms of the criteria they chose and which hospitals appear on the lists,'' <PERSON> McPherson </PERSON> said in a statement. <ORGANIZATION> Prudential </ORGANIZATION> is the nation's largest health insurer, covering 20 million people. It has negotiated contracts with hospitals to perform the special surgeries, including heart, kidney or liver transplants. Dr. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dragalin </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Prudential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>'s medical services division, said the company would use financial incentives, such as coverage of travel costs, to have policyholders travel to a handful of hospitals nationwide `` We decided if we were going to direct patients -LRB- to specific hospitals -RRB- we would choose institutions that meet very tough criteria,'' said <PERSON> Dragalin </PERSON>. He also said <ORGANIZATION> Prudential </ORGANIZATION> chose hospitals that offered the highest quality package for various operations. <ORGANIZATION> Prudential </ORGANIZATION> said hospitals found foremost in the industry were promised `` volume in exchange for cost discounts.'' The company negotiated discounts of 25 percent to 30 percent on the complex operations, which can cost up to $ 250,000. <PERSON> Diedre </PERSON> <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON>, manager of group medical services, said the company also tried to find institutions that could serve as regional facilities for <ORGANIZATION> Prudential </ORGANIZATION> beneficiaries requiring a particular operation. <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, said his group long has advocated the use of designated hospitals for complex operations. `` We believe there are two distinct advantages,'' he said. `` When only a few hospitals perform a high volume of transplant operations, we believe the outcome of the operations are likely to improve. We also see designated hospitals preventing unnecessary duplication of investment in transplant capacity, which will hold down costs.'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Mortimer </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Midwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, a Chicago-based coalition of employers, also said the plan could prompt lower health-care costs. `` Getting the insurance industry to actively purchase care for its corporate clients is a major step,'' <PERSON> Mortimer </PERSON> said in Wednesday's edition of the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>. Of the 50 to 60 hospitals that do transplants, <ORGANIZATION> Prudential </ORGANIZATION> found three qualified for heart transplants, two for liver transplants and seven for kidney transplants. <PERSON> Dragalin </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Prudential </ORGANIZATION> intends to expand the system to include other complex and costly procedures, including bone marrow transplants, coronary artery bypass surgery, burn treatment and a host of neurosurgical operations. <PERSON> Dragalin </PERSON> said the company is negotiating with eight hospitals to provide neurosurgical services. The 1.5 million <ORGANIZATION> Prudential </ORGANIZATION> beneficiaries who are members of health maintenance organizations or managed care plans will be required to use the designated institutions, the company said, while <ORGANIZATION> Prudential </ORGANIZATION> plans to continue paying for the operations of other policyholders who use non-designated hospitals. <ORGANIZATION> Prudential </ORGANIZATION> said its primary goal is to prevent patients from being drawn to inexperienced hospitals by lower prices for complex operations. `` Hospitals are increasingly diversifying and performing procedures they have n't done in the past,'' <PERSON> Dragalin </PERSON> said, adding that many are trying to compensate for the loss of some traditional business to health maintenance organizations.

<HEAD>SouthernNet, Teleconnect Agree To Form Long Distance Holding
Company</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A new telephone holding company that will become the nation's fourth-largest long distance carrier has no plans to take on the industry leaders nationally, according to company officials. <ORGANIZATION> SouthernNet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Teleconnect </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Cedar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rapids </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, said Wednesday they signed a letter of intent to create a yet-to-be-named holding company that will form a long distance carrier serving about 400,000 customers. The company would have annual revenue of more than $ 400 million. Teleconnect, formed in 1979, and SouthernNet, founded in 1984, have grown rapidly, providing long distance and other telephone services mainly to businesses within their regions. Teleconnect, which made its initial public stock offering this year, operates in 21 mainly Midwestern states. The company earned $ 7.6 million, or 90 cents per share, on revenue of $ 167.8 million last year. SouthernNet operates in 10 Southeastern states and in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, and earned $ 8.7 million, or 62 cents per share, on revenue of $ 228.6 million last year. Trading was halted on both companies' shares early Wednesday afternoon with SouthernNet standing at $ 20.62 -LCB- a share on the over-the-counter market and Teleconnect at $ 15 on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Wednesday's joint announcement said the holding company would concentrate on regional operations and not compete directly with the big three of <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION>. The companies have `` high penetration in some areas and we specifically do not want to to out and try to cover the nation,'' said SouthernNet President <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabbard </PERSON>, who will serve as chairman and chief executive officer of the Atlanta-based holding company. Teleconnect chairman and chief executive <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> McLeod </PERSON> will be vice chairman and president of the company. The nation's long distance market has been estimated at $ 50 billion annually, with <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T getting 72 percent. <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> has about 10 percent and <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> about 7 percent, according to <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Grubman </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION>. `` Our aspiration is not to be a national player but to be very strong regional players sharing research and development and sharing network capacities,'' <PERSON> McLeod </PERSON> said. Shareholders, who still must approve the deal, would receive one share of stock in the new holding company for each share they now hold in the regional companies. The companies also announced quarterly results Wednesday. Teleconnect reporting second quarter earnings of $ 2.6 million, or 23 cents per share, on revenue of $ 60.3 million. SouthernNet earned $ 5.9 million, or 43 cents per share, on revenue of $ 65.9 million, compared with a profit of $ 3.07 million, or 22 cents per share, on $ 55.47 in revenue during the year-earlier quarter. The latest quarter includes $ 2.42 million from SouthernNet's sale of a cellular telephone subsidiary The boards of both companies have approved formation of the new company, which remains subject to regulatory approval as well as the execution of a definitive agreement. <PERSON> Gabbard </PERSON> estimated the deal would be completed in the fourth quarter. The two companies have worked together previously, and last month announced the creation of a national toll-free service.

<HEAD>USX Head Says Steel Unit Could Be For Sale, But No Buyers Yet</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EARL BOHN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 With the steel industry enjoying a healthy revival after seven years of depression, <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is willing to sell a chunk of its steel-making USS division, according to Chairman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Roderick </PERSON>. But so far, proposals to spin off up to 20 percent of the unit have come only from investment bankers, not actual principals, <PERSON> Roderick </PERSON> said Wednesday at his quarterly news conference. <PERSON> Roderick </PERSON> said he welcomed proposals, `` providing we were offered full, f-u-l-l, value ... and we certainly have no incentive to sell it for less than full value.'' The chairman of the energy and steel company declined to suggest a figure. `` We would n't want to restrict the imagination of potential buyers,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Corry </PERSON> said any deal probably would involve <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> making a public offering of stock in part of the steelmaking division. <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> would retain tax benefits accumulated during steel's years of unprofitable operations, said <PERSON> Corry </PERSON>, who is considered a leading candidate to succeed <PERSON> Roderick </PERSON> when the chairman reaches the company's mandatory retirement age of 65 next May. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Roderick </PERSON> projected 1988 steel industry shipments of 81 million tons or more, a high figure that would mean two more quarters of robust business. With demand for steel showing no signs of faltering and mills running at or near capacity, prices are rising and profits are flowing in, he said. <PERSON> Roderick </PERSON> said the USS division, the domestic industry's largest producer, is reconsidering an Oct. 1 price increased it announced to customers of flat-rolled steel. The timing of the price move was undermined by <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, the third-largest producer, which scheduled increases of up to 5.5 percent for Jan. 1. No. 2-ranked <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> followed <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>'s lead <PERSON> Roderick </PERSON> said price increases are justified even though his company is churning out profits of $ 70 per ton. `` Back in the first first quarter of this year, our prices were about 19 percent below 1981. We've picked some of that back up in the second quarter, but my guess is that we're still 12 to 13 percent below the 1981 steel prices,'' he said. `` And when we get out of this decade ... the steel prices are going to be lower than when we came into the decade,'' <PERSON> Roderick </PERSON> said. `` I ask you, how many manufacturing industries in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are going to get through the decade of the'80s with absolutely zero inflation in price?'' Stronger earnings in steel compensated for the diminished performance in energy for a fourth consecutive quarter as <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday reported second-quarter profits of $ 213 million, or 74 cents per share, on sales of $ 4.3 billion. `` Oil carried us from 1982 through 1987,'' <PERSON> Roderick </PERSON> said. `` This is the first period when earnings from energy were lower than earnings from steel.''

<HEAD>Dollar Up in Technical Reaction to Earlier Falls; Gold Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar was slightly stronger today against most European currencies in what dealers said was a technical reaction to earlier declines. Gold was weaker. Traders said the dollar was recovering through heavy central bank intervention after it was driven down Wednesday by disappointing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> gross national product figures. `` It went down unbelievably fast Wednesday, and so I believe there is some room to make -LRB- the dollar -RRB- a little firmer today,'' said a <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> trader. `` The central banks really pushed hard on the dollar, and now it's a bit undervalued.'' The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy grew 3.1 percent in the second quarter of 1988, less than the 4 percent rate widely anticipated.

 <ORGANIZATION> Henley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, after failing to gain control of <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, says it will sell its <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fe </ORGANIZATION> shares to <ORGANIZATION> Itel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in a deal that would give <PERSON> Henley </PERSON> a 40 percent stake in the Chicago-based holding company. The companies valued the deal at $ 1.2 billion in cash and stock. The complex transaction agreed to Wednesday also calls for sale to <ORGANIZATION> Itel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Henley </ORGANIZATION>'s stock holdings in American President Cos.. <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, a shipping container company, and of <ORGANIZATION> Henley </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Signal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary, a financing company and lessor of railroad cars <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION>, which fended off <PERSON> Henley </PERSON>'s advances over a six-month period, responded favorably. Its president and chief executive officer, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Krebs </PERSON>, said in a news release: `` We ... are sure that <ORGANIZATION> Itel </ORGANIZATION> wil be a constructive shareholder of <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Henley </PERSON>'s stock price rose $ 1.50 a share to $ 24.75 in over-the-counter trading Wednesday, while <ORGANIZATION> Itel </ORGANIZATION> advanced 25 cents to $ 19.87. <PERSON> Henley </PERSON>, a holding company run by investor <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingman </PERSON> out of dual headquarters in <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jolla </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Hampton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, said it would receive $ 827 million cash and 18.7 million shares of newly issued <ORGANIZATION> Itel </ORGANIZATION> stock. That would give <PERSON> Henley </PERSON> 40 percent share of <ORGANIZATION> Itel </ORGANIZATION>, which leases railroad cars and owns dredging and wire companies in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> area. <ORGANIZATION> Itel </ORGANIZATION> would get <PERSON> Henley </PERSON>'s 16.9 percent share of Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fe </ORGANIZATION>; its 9.6 percent holding in <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> President of <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and its 13.2 percent stake in <ORGANIZATION> Oak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Rancho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, company that makes and distributes electronic equipment for the cable television and other industries. <PERSON> Henley </PERSON> subsidiaries Signal Capital and the smaller <ORGANIZATION> Equilease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> also would change hands, bringing <ORGANIZATION> Itel </ORGANIZATION>'s total assets to $ 3.6 billion. <PERSON> Henley </PERSON>, which under <PERSON> Dingman </PERSON> has bought and reshuffled a number of companies in recent years, would be subject to a 10-year standstill agreement requiring it to vote its <ORGANIZATION> Itel </ORGANIZATION> shares with management and barring further purchases, said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Knox </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Itel </ORGANIZATION>'s senior vice president and general counsel <ORGANIZATION> Itel </ORGANIZATION> principals <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Zell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lurie </PERSON>, who through a partnership own 20 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Itel </ORGANIZATION>'s 27 million shares, would be issued warrants to purchase new stock to maintain their 20 percent equity position, <PERSON> Knox </PERSON> said. The railroad portion of the deal is subject to federal antitrust review, which the companies said is expected to take 30 days. <ORGANIZATION> Itel </ORGANIZATION> would emerge as the largest railroad car lessor in country, with 30,000 railroad freight cars owned by <ORGANIZATION> Signal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Pullman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leasing </ORGANIZATION> in addition to its own 43,000 cars, the company said. On March 18, an adverse court ruling prompted <PERSON> Henley </PERSON> to abandon a proxy fight for seats on <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fe </ORGANIZATION>'s board, ending a six-month battle that included attempts to buy the company. A rival suitor, <ORGANIZATION> Olympia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Developments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>, ended up with 19.6 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fe </ORGANIZATION> and two board seats. <ORGANIZATION> Itel </ORGANIZATION> approached <PERSON> Henley </PERSON> a few months ago specifically about acquiring <PERSON> Pullman </PERSON> and discussions blossomed into a far-reaching transaction among like-minded investors <PERSON> Dingman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Zell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lurie </PERSON>, <PERSON> Knox </PERSON> said. `` Part of the attraction of this deal was the possibility of working together,'' <PERSON> Knox </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Zell </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Itel </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman and chief executive officer, and longtime business partner <PERSON> Lurie </PERSON>, now a director, bought into <ORGANIZATION> Itel </ORGANIZATION> in 1984 as it was emerging from bankruptcy and moved it from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> in late 1985 and early 1986. <ORGANIZATION> Itel </ORGANIZATION>, which earned $ 8.3 million on sales of $ 1.3 billion last year, leases rail cars under that name and owns <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lakes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, a dredging company in <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brook </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Anixter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION>, a wire manufacturer in <LOCATION> Skokie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dingman </PERSON>, 56, built what is now <PERSON> Henley </PERSON> out of businesses spun off in the 1985 merger that formed <ORGANIZATION> Allied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Signal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>.

 Stock prices rose Thursday, boosted mainly by speculative buying of selected issues. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index rose 5.2 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,846.0 by mid-afternoon. Volume was 275.2 million shares, compared with 188.9 million shares at the same time Wednesday.

<TEXT>
 The ruler of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> affirmed Thursday his nation's support for unity within the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, the official emirates news agency <ORGANIZATION> WAM </ORGANIZATION> reported. The agency, reporting the meeting between <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Zayed </PERSON> <PERSON> Bin </PERSON> <PERSON> Sultan </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Nahyan </PERSON> and cartel Secretary-General <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON>, quoted the U.A.E. president as saying his country `` has always been at the forefront for boosting <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> decisions and supporting the stability of the oil market.'' The report did not specifically address the controversial issue of U.A.E. oil production, but it indicated the emirates would not undermine the 13-nation cartel by adopting unilateral decisions. <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Zayed </PERSON>'s statements were made after <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON> gave him a message from <ORGANIZATION> OEPC </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Rilwanu </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukman </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>, according to the <ORGANIZATION> WAM </ORGANIZATION> report. Details of the message were not disclosed. The meeting was also attended by <PERSON> Mana </PERSON> <PERSON> Saeed </PERSON> <PERSON> Otaiba </PERSON>, the federal U.A.E. oil minister. <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON> and <PERSON> Otaiba </PERSON> met earlier as oil sources said the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> secretary-general sought a compromise regarding the U.A.E. claim for a higher oil production quota. <ORGANIZATION> WAM </ORGANIZATION> said only that <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON> discussed with <PERSON> Otaiba </PERSON> the `` latest developments in the world oil market.'' The sources, who spoke on condition they not be named, said <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON>'s visit came in response to reports quoting U.A.E. oil officials as saying the country would abandon its <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> production quota of 948,000 barrels of oil a day and produce about 1.5 million barrels a day. They noted <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s price monitoring committee will meet Aug. 3 in <LOCATION> Lausanne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, to discuss the oil market situation in light of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s decision to accept a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> resolution calling for a cease-fire in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war. The war has been casting shadows on the cartel's efforts to curb production levels and maintain an $ 18 per barrel benchmark price. Both <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> are prominent <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members and have been flouting production and pricing policies, respectively, because of the conflict. The U.A.E. demand for a higher quota is also a prominent issue for the <LOCATION> Lausanne </LOCATION> meeting of the five-member pricing committee which comprises the oil ministers of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Otaiba </PERSON> has said the U.A.E.'s current quota was not fair and did not synchronize with its production potential, claimed to be 4 million barrels per day.

I had to do it myself.'' With the chief executive and operating officers now in place, <PERSON> Noyce </PERSON> said he was `` confident we're going to be able to make a quick transition into full blown operations.'' <ORGANIZATION> Sematech </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, is the nation's first semiconductor research consortium supported by both private industry and the federal government. <ORGANIZATION> Sematech </ORGANIZATION> will sponsor and conduct research into advanced semiconductor manufacturing processes, materials and equipment. Results of the research will be available to the 14 member companies and the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> license-royalty free, and one to two years later will be available to non-members. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> appropriated $ 100 million to <ORGANIZATION> Sematech </ORGANIZATION> in this year's budget and the consortium said it is confident next fiscal year's budget will also contain $ 100 The total budget is $ 250 million annually. Semiconductors are vital parts in almost every modern electronics system _ from microwave ovens to communications satellites.

 The stock market turned mostly mixed today as investors remained apathetic while awaiting a clearer indication on the direction of interest rates.

<HEAD>June Gain Best in 3 Months; Spending Up at Faster Rate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Americans' personal income jumped a healthy 0.7 percent in June, the best showing in three months, while consumer spending rose even faster, the government said today. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said that consumer spending rose 1.0 percent to $ 3.21 trillion, following a 0.6 percent increase in May. It was the biggest increase since spending shot up 1.3 percent last August. The big rise in spending is likely to be viewed as worrisome by analysts who have been looking for consumer demand to ease to allow room in the economy for production of exports. Too much consumer demand is seen as inflationary because it places a strain on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturers who are fighting to lower the trade deficit. The $ 27.9 billion increase in personal incomes to $ 4.04 trillion followed a 0.5 percent rise in May, a modest 0.2 percent increase in April and a 1.0 percent jump in March. With spending rising a bit faster than income, Americans' personal savings rate fell slightly to 4.3 percent, compared with 4.4 percent in May Still, the average savings rate for the first half of 1988, 4.1 percent, is up substantially from 3.2 percent in 1987. Americans' after-tax income increased 0.8 percent in June after shooting up 2.4 percent in May. The gain in income in part reflected healthy increases in employment in June. The unemployment rate dropped to 5.3 percent last month, a 14-year low. That was somewhat offset by a $ 1.3 billion decrease in farm income in June, attributed to a $ 3.9 billion drop in federal farm subsidy payments. The department gave these details of spending: _ On durable goods, `` big ticket'' items expected to last three or more years, spending rose $ 8.6 billion in June compared with an increase of $ 2.7 billion in May _ On non-durable goods, spending rose $ 4.5 billion in June, compared with $ 4.6 billion the month before

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gartner </PERSON>, who unofficially starts today as president of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, says he faces no immediate pressure to raise the evening news ratings or develop new programs. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> announced Wednesday he had chosen the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> newspaper editor to succeed <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grossman </PERSON>, who is stepping down after four years. `` Different times call for different types of people,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said, saying that the network faced an era of `` enormous change, both technologically and economically.'' When <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> offered the job last week during the Democratic National Convention, <ORGANIZATION> Gartner </ORGANIZATION> said, `` We did n't talk about the present, we talked about the future.'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, who was installed as president after <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> bought <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> in 1986, has enforced financial discipline in all network divisions and has talked of the need for innovation as the networks' share of the viewing audience declines. `` He -LRB- <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> -RRB- wants me to lead, he wants me to manage, he wants me to use my news judgment, and he wants me to be a good businessman, but most of all he wants me to think about the future and help lead <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> into the future, safely and soundly, and with vigor,'' <ORGANIZATION> Gartner </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. <PERSON> Gartner </PERSON>, 49, has most recently been a part-time general news executive with <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and editor of the Ames -LRB- <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> He is an attorney, a former president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Editors </ORGANIZATION>, and a former editor of The Courier-Journal of <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, and the <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> -RRB- Register. From 1960 to 1974, he worked for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>, the last five as editor of the front page. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> correspondent <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Chancellor </PERSON> praised the appointment as `` audacious and intelligent.'' `` We get various reactions to it around the water cooler here,'' <PERSON> Chancellor </PERSON> said. `` One is that <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> has set good journalism as his first priority _ that's obviously clear. Another reaction I would have is that <ORGANIZATION> Gartner </ORGANIZATION> will be able to prove that good journalism is the heart of the enterprise.'' <PERSON> Grossman </PERSON>, a former public television executive, had been criticized within <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s news division because he had no experience in journalism. But he said he left because of friction with the executive office. Early in <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s tenure, <PERSON> Grossman </PERSON> had refused to go along with a cost-cutting exercise, but later fell into line. `` It's time for them to get their own guy in there,'' <PERSON> Grossman </PERSON> said Wednesday in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, where he was attending an <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> meeting. `` Things have changed. It has n't been all that fun lately. I've been there four years. It's a difference in style, personality and priorities.'' During <PERSON> Grossman </PERSON>'s tenure at <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, `` Nightly News'' and the `` Today'' rose to the top of the ratings. Lately, however, `` Nightly News'' has been consistently third in a tight ratings race. <PERSON> Gartner </PERSON> said he met <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> a few months ago to discuss First Amendment issues. He said they had second conversation about <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, and the offer came last week. `` I've got a lot to learn, as a starter, and I've got a lot of new people to get to know and to deal with, and to get them to sign on so that we can move <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> forward together,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Gartner </ORGANIZATION>'s only previous experience with television was with the Register's broadcast group, which owned television stations in <LOCATION> Moline </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>. `` He wanted to make sure the newscast gave you something,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>, who headed the Register broadcast group and now is publisher of the <ORGANIZATION> Pioneer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> group of weekly newspapers based in <LOCATION> Wilmette </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION> `` He wanted to give people news of substance and usefulness.'' <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Waller </PERSON>, general manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Ames </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Gartner </ORGANIZATION> has `` an energy field that gets everybody fired up. He is just an exceptional individual.'' `` He has an electric personality,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gannon </PERSON>, editor of The Des Moines Register. `` He's a brilliant journalist, a great idea person and a very outgoing personality who had good effects on morale in the newsroom.''

<HEAD>Tonka Corp. To Lay Off 110 Employees</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNETONKA, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Tonka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> announced a $ 7.6 million second-quarter loss and said it has laid off 110 employees in a restructuring of its <ORGANIZATION> Kenner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Tonka </ORGANIZATION> toy divisions. In cutting the 87 full-time and 23 part-time employees Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION> Tonka </ORGANIZATION> cited disappointing sales of its once hot Pound Puppies line and other <ORGANIZATION> Tonka </ORGANIZATION> products as well as a need to eliminate overlapping responsibilities with the recently-acquired <PERSON> Kenner </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> <PERSON> Toys </PERSON>. The company said its second-quarter loss came on sales of $ 198.4 million, and compared with earnings of $ 1.6 million, or 20 cents per share, on sales of $ 49.6 million in the same period a year earlier. <ORGANIZATION> Tonka </ORGANIZATION> attributed the loss to charges in connection with the <PERSON> Kenner </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> acquisition. The results brought <ORGANIZATION> Tonka </ORGANIZATION>'s six-month losses to $ 18.1 million, compared with earnings of $ 3.2 million, or 41 cents a share, in the first half of 1987. First half revenues rose to $ 366.8 million from $ 97.9 million. <ORGANIZATION> Tonka </ORGANIZATION> renewed its earlier prediction that it would break even or earn a profit for the year after reporting a loss of $ 7.5 million for all of 1987. The layoffs announced Wednesday were the latest in a series of employee cuts among <ORGANIZATION> Tonka </ORGANIZATION>'s four divisions since the <PERSON> Kenner </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> acquisition was announced last fall, reducing total employment from about 4,600 to about 3,975. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Shank </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Tonka </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman and chief executive, said he hoped Wednesday's action would put the company in a stable business position. <ORGANIZATION> Tonka </ORGANIZATION> also announced Wednesday two <PERSON> Kenner </PERSON> executives will head a new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> toy group within the company to oversee the autonomous <PERSON> Kenner </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Tonka </ORGANIZATION> divisions. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Mauer </PERSON>, 39, president and general manager of <PERSON> Kenner </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, will head the group, and <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Fortino </PERSON>, 51, senior vice president of <PERSON> Kenner </PERSON>, will hold the same position within the new group.

<HEAD>Central Bank Raises Key Lending Rate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s central bank on Thursday raised its Lombard lending rate to 5 percent in a bid to bolster the mark, which has lost ground to other major currencies in recent weeks. The Lombard rate had stood at 4.5 percent since Nov. 6, 1987. The mark has been falling against the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar and the British pound on foreign exchange markets. Analysts said the <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION>'s decision, which is effective Friday, was aimed at supporting the mark and slowing the flow of capital out of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` With this measure, the <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> is taking account of the development of market interest rates and tensions in the currency market,'' a <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said. The Lombard rate is the interest rate charged on banks' short-term borrowings from the central bank against securities as collateral The <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> left its discount rate unchanged at 3 percent, which was set June 30 after a hike of 0.5 percent. The higher Lombard rate effectively lifts the ceiling on money market rates, giving the <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> room to directly tighten money market rates further if the mark shows major signs of weakening, analysts said. <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> <PERSON> Poehl </PERSON> has said the dollar's advance against the mark endangers international efforts to adjust trade imbalances in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> Thursday's announcement follows <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> decisions to raise the rate on securities repurchase deals for commercial banks. That rate has been raised three times in the last six weeks by .25 percent increments to its current 4 percent.

 Grain and soybean futures opened mixed today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> with soybeans slightly higher, corn mostly lower and wheat narrowly mixed. The rebound in the soybean market indicated traders were picking up contracts at what were seen as bargain prices after more than a week of sharp declines, analysts said. `` People are bottom-picking, buying it on expectations that because it's been down so far, it's bound to go up one of these sessions,'' said <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Spilka </PERSON>, grains analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The early gains in the soybean pit occurred despite tne <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s latest 6-to-10-day forecast, which predicted normal rainfall next week in most of the drought-stricken <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. The corn market appeared nervous about the possibility of a further decline, and wheat traders were awaiting word of new export business, <PERSON> Spilka </PERSON> said. In early trading, wheat was 1 cent lower to 6 cents higher with the contract for delivery in September at $ 3.61 a bushel; corn was 2 \ cents lower to 4 -LCB- cents higher with September at $ 2.77 -LCB- a bushel; oats were unchanged to 1 -LCB- cents higher with September at $ 2.49 a bushel; soybeans were 1 cent to 4 -LCB- cents higher with August at $ 7.58 a bushel Cattle futures were mixed while pork futures were sharply lower in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle were unchanged to .47 cent lower with August at 66.22 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .30 cent lower to .35 cent higher with August at 78.70 cents a pound; hogs were .52 cent to 1.05 cents lower with August at 44.35 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .27 cent to the limit 2 cents lower with August at 30.95 cents a pound.

<HEAD>Revco Files For Chapter 11 Bankruptcy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TWINSBURG, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Drug store giant Revco D.S. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said today it filed for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code. The filing includes <ORGANIZATION> Revco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> D.S. </ORGANIZATION>, its parent company, <ORGANIZATION> ANAC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holding </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, and most of its subsidiary corporations. <ORGANIZATION> Revco </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> Insta-Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pharmacy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> is not included in the filing. Boake A. Sells, chairman and chief executive officer, said <ORGANIZATION> Revco </ORGANIZATION>'s 2,000 drugstores in 27 states will remain open and the company's 28,000 employees will continue to be employed. `` Revco is in business to stay,'' Sells said. `` The stores are open, employees have jobs and are being paid and customers can get prescriptions filled as always. `` Although we had hoped to avoid this filing and restructure our finances outside of the courts, we had warned of the possibility of a voluntary filing for several months. Events of the last few days left us with no viable alternative. This is a fight about who owns <ORGANIZATION> Revco </ORGANIZATION>, not how <ORGANIZATION> Revco </ORGANIZATION> operates,'' Sells said. <ORGANIZATION> Revco </ORGANIZATION> was taken private in a leveraged buyout in late 1986. In a leveraged buyout, those making the acquisition usually borrow heavily against the cash flow or assets of the company being acquired. The bankruptcy filing was necessary because holders of about $ 400 million of the company's high-yielding bonds demanded immediate payment of principal and $ 46 million in interest that the company failed to pay as scheduled June 15, said <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Obert </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Revco </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman. She said under terms of the subordinated bonds, payment of the principal is prohibited until the company's debt to senior lenders is paid. <ORGANIZATION> Revco </ORGANIZATION>'s total debt is about $ 1.5 billion and <PERSON> Obert </PERSON> said the company filed for bankruptcy to be able to continue company operations. `` The senior banks are saying you have to give us the debt first and the subordinated want it first,'' Ms. <PERSON> Obert </PERSON> said. `` This is not a liquidating bankruptcy, the stores are open and the normal business operations are intact.'' The filing allows <ORGANIZATION> Revco </ORGANIZATION> to obtain new credit and invoices for goods and services, and requires the company to submit a reorganization plan, restructuring the company's debt, to the court, <PERSON> Obert </PERSON> said. With annual sales of $ 2.3 billion and 2,000 outlets, <ORGANIZATION> Revco </ORGANIZATION> operates the nation's largest drug store chain, filling more than 65 million prescriptions each year.

 The stock market was mostly mixed today in dull trading as investors awaited a clearer indication on the direction of interest rates. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 11.02 at 2,064.72 at midday. Gainers slightly outnumbered losers in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 607 issues up, 581 down and 539 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 77.50 million shares as of noon on Wall Street. The Dow firmed on the opening, then flirted with negative territory before heading higher. Market watchers cautioned, however, that any spike upward is likely to be temporary. Analysts noted that investors' key focus is interest rates. `` The market seems to be suffering from interest-rate paranoia,'' one trader said. Concern that rates might be moving upward heightened on Wednesday when the goverment reported that inflation rose more than 4 percent in the last quarter. `` The market ca n't mount any kind of sustainable move if you have rates going against you,'' noted <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wachtel </PERSON>, first vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. He said the bond market has to stabilize on a longer term basis before money pours back into stocks. But the credit market headed lower again today after the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that Americans' personal incomes rose 0.7 percent while consumer spending jumped 1.0 percent during June. Analysts are likely view the big rise in spending as inflationary because it places a strain on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturers who are fighting to lower the trade deficit. As bond prices move lower, rising yields have been attracting funds that normally would have been earmarked for equities.

<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Coastal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said its after-tax profit rose 37 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier, boosted by gains in all its areas of operation and reduction of its debt. The diversified energy company reported Thursday that its second-quarter profit increased to $ 30.6 million, or 50 cents a share, from $ 22.3 million, or 40 cents a share, a year earlier. Second-quarter revenue rose 11.8 percent, to $ 1.9 billion from $ 1.7 billion. The largest second-quarter increase was in the oil and gas exploration and production segment, where earnings more than doubled to $ 14.6 million from $ 7.1 million a year earlier. Coastal said the increase was due largely to a favorable settlement of a contested natural gas supply contract. The company's other operations include gas pipelines, oil refining and marketing, coal and trucking. `` Coastal has reduced outstanding debt and preferred stock by about $ 470 million to date this year and by a total of more than $ 1.1 billion since the end of 1985, the year of the merger with <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Coastal </ORGANIZATION>'s president and chief operating officer In the first half of the year, <ORGANIZATION> Coastal </ORGANIZATION>'s earnings rose to $ 77.1 million, or $ 1.35 a share, from $ 66.4 million, or $ 1.25 a share, a year earlier.

Two weeks of extensive negotiations have failed to produce a definitive agreement, said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Silbert </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> chairman and chief executive officer. Details of the talks between the two financiers who share a fascination with <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> were n't released. The restructuring, which would have left <PERSON> Kerkorian </PERSON> in control of a `` new'' <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Artists </ORGANIZATION> and with a substantial share of the resurrected <ORGANIZATION> MGM </ORGANIZATION>, was the latest in a series of shuffles the <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, financier has made at the company. Analysts saw it as a means of raising funds to pay down the debts of the company which produced the Oscar-winning movie `` Moonstruck'' and TV's `` thirtysomething,'' though much of the new money would have come from <PERSON> Kerkorian </PERSON> himself. The complex shuffle, announced July 11, was to have been accomplished through an offering of rights to <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> shareholders entitling them to buy shares in the new <ORGANIZATION> MGM </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON>, through his <ORGANIZATION> Barris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which makes `` The Dating Game'' TV show, was to have bought 25 percent of the new stock. <PERSON> Barris </PERSON> producers <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peters </PERSON> and <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Guber </PERSON> would have run the new company. <PERSON> Kerkorian </PERSON> and public shareholders of <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> would have had the right to buy the rest of the new issue of 50 million shares at $ 8 a share. Of the $ 400 million raised, $ 300 million was to have gone back into <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Artists </ORGANIZATION> and $ 100 million to <ORGANIZATION> MGM </ORGANIZATION>. The new <ORGANIZATION> MGM </ORGANIZATION>, whose roaring lion trademark associated with such classic movies as `` Gone With the Wind,'' would have had rights to a batch of relatively new movies. But the company's original 3,000-title library was sold to broadcast entrepreneur <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> and the famed MGM movie lot was sold to <ORGANIZATION> Lorimar-Telepictures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <PERSON> Kerkorian </PERSON>'s last shuffle of the companies in 1986. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Artists </ORGANIZATION>' 1,000-title library includes the `` Rocky'' and `` Pink Panther'' movies.

<HEAD>Drought Aid Could Trip Gramm-Rudman Trigger, Administration Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration estimated today that the federal deficit for the upcoming budget year would be $ 140.1 billion, $ 5.9 billion under the trigger for across-the-board spending reductions. But budget director <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said too large a drought-relief package could provoke the automatic cuts. The new deficit estimate, covering the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1, is $ 5.9 billion smaller than the $ 146 billion level that would force cuts to kick-in under the Gramm-Rudman balanced budget law. But in presenting the estimate, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION>, warned that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> must exercise spending restraint in granting relief to farmers and in several other areas or face the risk of triggering automatic spending cuts. `` We can not do all those things. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has got to pare down and make sure it does not go over the limit,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> told reporters at a White House briefing. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> warned that drought-relief and other spending proposals pending before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> could push the deficit upward and trigger the politically painful spending cuts, which would take effect just before the November elections. The drought-relief measures now being considered in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are estimated to cost $ 4.3 billion to $ 6.6 billion. The administration wants to keep the drought package at $ 4 billion to $ 5 billion. The administration is also fighting to hold the spending line on other measures currently before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. These include anti-drug legislation, pending trade legislation and a supplemental spending bill. Under the Gramm-Rudman act, the administration is required to estimate the coming year's fiscal budget deficit by mid-August to project whether across-the-board spending cuts will take effect. The White House budget office must then adjust that estimate in October to take into account any new legislation. If such legislation pushes the deficit past the trigger amount of $ 146 billion, across-the-board spending cuts of more than $ 10 billion automatically take effect. The report today, known as a mid-session review, estimated that the deficit in the current fiscal year would be $ 152.3 billion. This estimate is still more optimistic than those of many private forecasters and the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, which is projecting a deficit of $ 157 billion for the current fiscal year. The 1987 budget deficit was $ 150.4 billion, down from the record $ 221.1 billion deficit run up in 1986. The sharp reduction last year occurred because of a one-time windfall in revenues generated by a massive overhaul of the tax law. The revised deficit estimate for the current fiscal year of $ 152.3 billion was up from the administration's February estimate that the deficit this year would be $ 146.7 billion, which would have made it lower than the 1987 imbalance. The administration blamed that higher deficit figure on increased government spending in several areas. One of the biggest over-runs occurred in the federal deposit insurance programs that protect depositors at banks and savings and loans association. The budget review said that the insurance funds would pay out $ 4.6 billion more this year than had been originally budgeted because of high failure rates at banks and thrift institutions in the depressed <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION>. The deficit target under the Gramm-Rudman legislation for the upcoming fiscal year is $ 136 billion, but the legislation says automatic spending cuts can be avoided if the government's deficit projection is within $ 10 billion of that figure. Thus, for 1989, any estimate below $ 146 billion would avoid the need for spending cuts. If the cuts did take effect, half of the reductions would come from the military and half from domestic spending programs. However, 70 percent of the domestic budget, including such programs as Social Security, has been declared off limits. Thus such programs as AIDS research and drug-law enforcement would feel the brunt of a disproportionate share of any automatic spending cut, the administration has warned.

<HEAD>FDIC Decision Expected on Fate of First RepublicBank</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Officials of <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> RepublicBank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said federal regulators could decide the fate of the financially troubled bank holding company this week, but executives dismissed as speculation rumors that the bank would be declared insolvent. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which rescued <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> RepublicBank </ORGANIZATION> with a $ 1 billion loan in March, said Wednesday it was considering all options to resolve the company's financial crisis. An announcement could come Friday. Management of <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> RepublicBank </ORGANIZATION>, which had a net loss of $ 2.3 billion in the first six months of the year, is competing with three outside bidders for control of the institution. But the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> could declare the company insolvent and run the institution itself until a suitor is selected in a so-called bridge-bank transaction. The <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> received final proposals to buy <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> RepublicBank </ORGANIZATION> on Monday from <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a regional banking company based in <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>; and San Francisco-based <ORGANIZATION> Wells </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fargo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. First RepublicBank's management, led by Chairman <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>, submitted a plan to the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> to remain independent In a memo to <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> RepublicBank </ORGANIZATION> managers Wednesday, the company said it expected an <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> decision by the weekend. Spokesman <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowles </PERSON> said the memo was prompted by speculation that a bridge transaction was imminent. `` As the decision time grows near, we expect to see more of this speculation,'' <PERSON> Bowles </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> would ultimately shoulder close to $ 2 billion of the cost of any deal, <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Wiliam </PERSON> <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> has said, including an initial recapitalization of as much as $ 5 billion. Creation of a bridge bank would eliminate bondholder and shareholder claims and nullify all current lawsuits against <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> RepublicBank </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> can control the bridge bank for up to two years.

 The stock market gained ground today after a tentative opening as investors picked up blue chip and high-tech issues. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 12.27 to 2,065.97 at midafternoon. Gainers outnumbered losers by about 9 to 8 in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 699 issues up, 616 down and 536 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 108.55 million shares as of 2 p.m. on Wall Street. The Dow firmed on the opening but flirted with negative territory before heading higher. Market watchers cautioned, however, that any spike upward is likely to be temporary. Traders said the market drew some support from comments by <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, who said the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has not changed its view on the course of monetary policy. He also suggested the dollar is at appropriate levels against key foreign currencies. Gains in the marketplace were scattered, however. There was an improvement in several blue-chip issues, and high-tech stocks rose but failed to generate much momentum outside the sector. Analysts noted that investors' key focus is interest rates. `` The market seems to be suffering from interest-rate paranoia,'' one trader said. Concern that rates might be moving upward heightened on Wednesday when the goverment reported that inflation rose more than 4 percent in the last quarter. `` The market ca n't mount any kind of sustainable move if you have rates going against you,'' noted <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wachtel </PERSON>, first vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. He said the bond market has to stabilize on a longer term basis before money pours back into stocks. But the credit market headed lower again today after the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that Americans' personal incomes rose 0.7 percent while consumer spending jumped 1.0 percent during June. Analysts are likely view the big rise in spending as inflationary because it places a strain on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturers who are fighting to lower the trade deficit.

<HEAD>Greyhound's Profit Up 51.5 Percent in Second Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Greyhound </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said its after-tax profit jumped 51.5 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier, boosted by improvement in all its operations except financial services. The diversified company reported Thursday that its second-quarter profit rose to $ 29.7 million, or 78 cents a share, from $ 19.6 million, or 49 cents a share, a year earlier. Greyhound said its net income for the second quarter was affected by a $ 768,000 charge representing its loss on early retirement of debt by <ORGANIZATION> GLI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holding </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Earnings in the year-earlier quarter had been affected by a loss of $ 9 million from discontinued insurance operations and by a special charge of $ 2.7 million reflecting premiums paid on early retirement of debt Second-quarter revenue was up 39.3 percent, to $ 854 million from $ 613 million. The company said the increase resulted mainly from its acquisition of Dobbs airline and airport service business in November 1987 and its purchase of <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s transit bus and repair parts operations in mid-1987. In the first half of the year, Greyhound's profit declined to $ 47.3 million, or $ 1.23 a share, from $ 53.3 million, or $ 1.35 a share, a year earlier. First-half revenue rose to $ 1.6 billion from $ 1.2 billion. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Teets </PERSON>, Greyhound's chairman and chief executive officer, said all segments of the company have shown improvement in 1988, except for the financial group _ where gains from sales of assets this year have not matched the higher-than-normal 1987 levels. Second-quarter earnings of the financial group declined to $ 6.5 million from $ 7 million during the same period last year. The company's consumer products operations, primarily <ORGANIZATION> Dial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, reported net income of $ 14.7 million for the second quarter, up from $ 13.3 million a year earlier. The service group had earnings of $ 22.8 million, up from $ 15.3 million in the second quarter of 1987. The transportation-manufacturing group's profit rose to $ 7.8 million from $ 6 million a year earlier.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday that a string of popular movies and free spending by theme park patrons helped boost its profit for the latest quarter by 29 percent from a year ago. <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> said it earned $ 165 million, or $ 1.20 a share, in its third fiscal quarter ended June 30 from $ 128.4 million, or 93 cents a share, a year earlier. Third-quarter sales rose 22 percent to $ 915.7 million from $ 751.2 million in the third quarter of 1987. Disney continued to score box office successes, with `` Three Men and a Baby'' and `` Good Morning, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'' adding to a 46 percent increase in sales in the company's movie division. Sales at <LOCATION> Disneyland </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> theme parks, which contribute the bulk of the company's revenue, were up 12 percent in the quarter, though attendance was lower than last year, <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> said. Higher per-capita guest spending accounted for the increase, said the company, which does n't reveal specific visitor headcounts. Sales continued to increase in the new consumer products division as the company continued to open stores selling Disney paraphenalia. For the first nine months of 1988, profit rose 25 percent, to $ 385.6 million, or $ 2.81 a share, from $ 309.4 million, or $ 2.25 a share, a year ago. Nine-month sales rose 14.3 percent to $ 2.4 billion from $ 2.1 billion in the first nine months of 1987.

<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Meredith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday its earnings fell 19.4 percent in its fourth quarter from a year ago, reflecting weaker magazine profits, but that profit increased 39.6 percent for the full fiscal year, in large part because of accounting changes. The diversified media company reported profit in the fourth quarter ended June 30 fell to $ 6.7 million, or 35 cents a share, from $ 8.4 million, or 43 cents a share, in the same period a year earlier. Its revenue rose 23.2 percent to $ 194.1 million in the quarter from $ 157.5 million a year earlier. <PERSON> Meredith </PERSON> Chairman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> attributed the reduced earnings to declines in the company's magazine and broadcasting operations, despite gains from real estate ventures and a lower effective income tax rate. `` Weaker magazine profits in the fourth quarter reflect substantial increases in paper and postage costs and our March acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Craftways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> said in a statement releasing <PERSON> Meredith </PERSON>'s financial results. For the entire fiscal year, profit rose to $ 47.4 million, or $ 2.48 a share, from $ 33.9 million, or $ 1.77 a share, in the previous year. Without accounting changes, net profit would have been up 7.7 percent at $ 36.6 million, or $ 1.91 a share. However, profits from business operations fell 6.4 percent in the latest fiscal year to $ 36.6 million from $ 39 million. <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> attributed the drop in operating earnings in part to declines in <PERSON> Meredith </PERSON>'s television broadcasting, because of higher programming costs, and from residential real estate operations, because of low market values on houses acquired under a government relocation contract that no longer is in effect. Earnings benefited from a lower effective income tax rate and lower interest expenses. <PERSON> Meredith </PERSON> publishes books and magazines, including Better Homes and Gardens, and has interests in commercial printing, television and residential real estate marketing and franchising.

The company said the earnings decline in both periods resulted from higher development costs for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s Advanced Tactical fighter competition and the new MD-11 tri-jet, higher production costs in major aircraft programs and increased losses in the information systems segment. It said higher interest expenses were offset in part by lower income taxes, which declined because of lower tax rates. The 1987 earnings had been affected by several unusual items, including a non-recurring pre-tax charge of $ 66 million to cover the cost of an early retirement program. In addition, results for <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in 1987 included a gain of $ 15 million before taxes from the sale of about half of the corporation's interest in a computer services company. The company also said 1987 earnings were positively affected by a pre-tax gain of $ 38 million from the conversion to long-term leases of MD-80 jetliners previously leased on a short-term basis. A similar conversion in the first quarter of 1988 produced a pre-tax gain of $ 21 million.

 The stock market narrowly gained ground today as investors snapped up blue chip and high tech issues. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 21.34 at 2,075.04 an hour before the closing bell. Gainers outnumbered losers by about 13 to 9 in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 814 issues up, 572 down and 499 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 129.03 million shares as of 3 p.m. on Wall Street. The market's opening was tentative as the Dow flirted with negative territory before heading higher as bargain-hunters moved in to buy selected stocks. A firming bond market also helped support stock prices. The market's scattered gains centered on blue chip, high tech and takeover stocks. A better-than-expected quarterly earnings report from <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> served to support technology issues, while the publishing sector got a boost from takeover rumors surrounding <ORGANIZATION> McGraw-Hill </ORGANIZATION>, analysts said. Market watchers cautioned, however, that investors are largely uncommitted to equities. `` There's an enormous amount of cash on the sidelines,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Metz </PERSON>, a vice president and technical analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Oppenheimer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` Investors are waiting for some signal that interest rates have peaked or that the market is going up anyway before they really get aggressive,'' he said. Traders said the market drew some support from comments by <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, who said the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has not changed its view on the course of monetary policy. He also suggested the dollar is at appropriate levels against key foreign currencies. Analysts noted that investors' key focus is interest rates. `` The market seems to be suffering from interest-rate paranoia,'' one trader said. Concern that rates might be moving upward heightened on Wednesday when the goverment reported that inflation rose more than 4 percent in the last quarter. `` The market ca n't mount any kind of sustainable move if you have rates going against you,'' noted <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wachtel </PERSON>, first vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Separately, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that Americans' personal incomes rose 0.7 percent while consumer spending jumped 1.0 percent during June Analysts are likely view the big rise in spending as inflationary because it places a strain on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturers who are fighting to lower the trade deficit. Among actively traded Big Board issues, <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION> soared 8 -LRB- to 67 -LCB-. The company received a $ 64-a-share buyout offer from <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> McGraw-Hill </ORGANIZATION> was up 4 at 65 -RCB- amid rumors that the British firm <ORGANIZATION> Pearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> might make a bid for the publisher. Elsewhere, <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> rose 2 -LCB- to 104 -RCB-; the company reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>, which announced price increases on most of its products and services, rose 1 ~ to 123; <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> was up 1 \ at 43 -LCB-, and <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Packard </ORGANIZATION> was up -RCB- at 49 The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks rose 1.34 to 150.08.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> reaffirmed on Thursday its support for an investor group's $ 750 million buyout offer after a competing bidder withdrew its $ 795 million buyout proposal amid government antitrust concerns. York, a heating and air-conditioning equipment manufacturer, said <ORGANIZATION> SnyderGeneral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a privately-held concern based in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, notified <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> by letter that it was withdrawing its bid. <PERSON> York </PERSON> said its board had decided it was not in the interest of <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> stockholders to pursue further discussions or negotiations with <ORGANIZATION> SnyderGeneral </ORGANIZATION>. Instead, it reaffirmed its support for a tender offer by a subsidairy of the investor group <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> for up to 9.19 million shares, or 87.8 percent of <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s shares, at $ 57.50 per share expires at midnight Friday unless extended. <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION>' bid is backed by the venture-capital unit of <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION>, the huge banking concern. <ORGANIZATION> SnyderGeneral </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Pavlik </PERSON> said her company had no comment, and said company president <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> was not immediately available. According to <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> SnyderGeneral </ORGANIZATION>'s letter withdrawing the buyout offer said the antitrust division of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> `` raised new concerns late yesterday as to product overlap between <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and SnyderGeneral other than centrifugal and reciprocating chillers.'' `` If the Antitrust Division were to require a divestiture with respect to this particular product line, we would not be willing to consummate the acquisition of York,'' the letter said, according to <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The letter added that <ORGANIZATION> SnyderGeneral </ORGANIZATION> planned to keep talking with the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and said `` if we obtain a satisfactory resolution as to these new concerns, we intend to reinstate our offer.'' But <PERSON> York </PERSON> subsequently released a statement that said: `` Particularly in light of recent developments, most notably SnyderGeneral's last-minute withdrawal of its latest proposal, the <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> board reaffirms it support of the <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> transaction scheduled to close tomorrow.'' <PERSON> York </PERSON>'s statement indicates the company considers <ORGANIZATION> SnyderGeneral </ORGANIZATION> out of the picture, <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Early </PERSON> said. On Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said its board failed to meet a noon deadline that day to respond to a revised buyout proposal from <ORGANIZATION> SnyderGeneral </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> SnyderGeneral </ORGANIZATION> had requested consent Tuesday to modify its $ 795 million proposal under which <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> shareholders would receive $ 61 per share. The action came after York International announced the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> investigation of whether the proposed merger violated antitrust rules. York International was a unit of <ORGANIZATION> Borg-Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> until it was spun off and went public two years ago. <ORGANIZATION> SnyderGeneral </ORGANIZATION> is a privately held company that employs about 4,800 people at nine facilities.

After a tentative opening, bargain hunters and buy programs entered the market to push selected issues higher. The market's scattered gains centered on blue chip, technology and takeover stocks.

 The stock market strengthened Thursday in a technical rally led by blue-chip and high technology issues. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 28.63 to close at 2,082.33, erasing a 20-point drop in the previous session. Advancing issues outnumbered declines by roughly a 5-to-3 ratio in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 884 up, 531 down and 510 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 154.57 million shares, against 135.89 million in the previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 177.72 million shares. The market opened on a tentative note as the Dow average flirted with negative territory. But analysts said the market was poised for a technical rebound. `` In the last several days the broader market was doing better than the Dow,'' which had reached the low end of its recent trading range, said <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON>, vice president at <ORGANIZATION> A.G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. `` That was a precondition for a technical bounce,'' he added.

Analysts were not entirely optimistic that Thursday's upward spike would be sustained `` We'll have to wait and see,'' <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON> said. `` The bears showed what they could do last week and took the market down, now its the bulls' turn to strut their stuff and see if they can take it up.'' Traders said the market drew support from comments by <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, who said the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has not changed its view on monetary policy. He also suggested the dollar is at appropriate levels against key foreign currencies.

<TEXT>
 Drought may take a bite out of the income of many farmers, but the hot, dry weather is n't expected to cut back on their spending for many production items this year, an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report said Thursday. `` The drought is expected to have little impact on 1988 expenditures for seed, fertilizer and pesticides because most of these ... were applied at or before planting,'' the report said. `` Farm machinery expenditures are projected to increase again in 1988 but could be slowed by the drought.'' Spending on the fuel and electricity needed to run farms will be affected significantly by the drought, however. `` Energy expenditures for irrigation will be up, but likely will be more than offset by decreased outlays for harvesting and drying,'' the report said, a grim reminder that reduced yields _ or none at all _ mean it will cost less to run grain combines and dryers. Farmers spending on machinery increased $ 1.2 billion to $ 5.8 billion in 1987, ending seven years of decline, the report said. Net cash income of farmers _ the difference between gross cash receipts and cash expenses _ rose to a record $ 56 billion in calendar 1987. Current <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> forecasts put 1988 net cash income at $ 53 billion to $ 59 billion.

 Thousands of migrant workers are stranded in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and do n't have enough money to return home because the drought has robbed them of a living, a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> lawmaker said Thursday in seeking federal assistance. Democratic Rep. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bustamante </PERSON>, in a letter asking <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> for emergency aid, said many migrants are in a desperate situation `` we can no longer continue to ignore.'' <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Zachariasiewicz </PERSON> said the agency `` has a plan of action'' but it wo n't be unveiled until Mrs. <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON>, who is overseas, gives it her final approval. An announcement will be made next week. An administration source said the package would total $ 4 million to $ 5 million, but `` the final distribution is just not set on paper yet.'' The source spoke on condition of anonymity. In his letter to Mrs. <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bustamante </PERSON> said: `` Migrant workers pinned their hopes on a successful harvest and invested their personal savings to search for field work. Drought conditions have dashed their hopes for employment and for recouping their financial losses. `` Because the president's emergency relief program is directed solely at the farmer level, migrant workers and their families have no safety net to relieve their conditions. Measures taken to date have allowed migrant laborers to fall through cracks.'' <PERSON> Bustamante </PERSON>, a migrant worker for 23 years and the son and grandson of Mexican-Americans who followed the crops, said he still has relatives who travel from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> to harvest sugar beets. He estimates the stranded migrant and seasonal worker population at about 10,000, but said it is difficult to get a true figure. <PERSON> Bustamante </PERSON> said most of the migrants are <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens, and most are from along the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> border. `` Exhaused of their personal financial resources, they have no money for temporary shelter and food,'' he wrote. `` Many would like to return home, but they can not. They are broke, indebeted, stranded and dependent on the kindness and charity of local efforts.'' He said he is seeking funds to provide shelter, food and job-search assistance to migrants who want to stay in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> to help farmers salvage crops, and to give others who want to return home money for travel.

 Wheat farmers will still have to idle 10 percent of their base acreage in 1989 to qualify for federal price supports, despite the severe drought that has hit some producing areas this year, <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> announced Thursday. <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON>, who was out of town, said in a statement that the 10 percent acreage reduction for next year was announced on May 25, under 1985 farm law which requires a determination for the following year's crop prior to June 1. That was before the drought became so widespread and severe. `` Even though the severe drought has reduced wheat production, especially that of spring wheat, the prospective supply-demand balance -LRB- for the coming year -RRB- does not call for a change in the previously announced wheat acreage reduction program in 1989,'' <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> said. A crop projection issued on July 12 put the 1988 wheat crop at 1.84 billion bushels, down from 2.12 billion bushels forecast in June. The 1987 harvest was about 2.1 billion bushels. But <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat inventories have been large, despite a heavy export drain, and totaled around 1.27 billion bushels on June 1, the beginning of the 1988-89 wheat marketing year. The smaller harvest will result in a further reduction in the stockpile to around 666 million bushels by June 1, 1989, according to the projections. Earlier, the June 1, 1989, wheat carryover was forecast at 781 million bushels. Winter wheat, which comprises about three-fourths of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> total, will be planted this fall for harvest next year. Spring wheat, including durum used for pasta, is produced farther north and bore the brunt of this summer's drought damage to the wheat crop.

 The White House, in a move that could lead to a weakening of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s `` New Federalism'' campaign, will study whether the federal government should act more aggressively to supersede some state and local laws, an administration official said Thursday. That was the upshot of a meeting by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s Domestic Policy Council, which discussed the specific question of whether <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s Proposition 65 food-labeling requirement hampers interstate commerce and thus should be overtaken by federal regulation. It's one of the toughest consumer-oriented regulations in the country, requiring warnings on any food products suspected of presenting a risk for birth defects or cancer. During his more than 7 -LCB- years as president, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has advocated a `` New Federalism'' policy aimed at relinquishing some of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s regulatory powers to states and local governments. An executive order aimed at instituting this policy contains language suggesting intervention by <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> under certain circumstances, however. An administration official said no decision was reached at Thursday's meeting on whether to interfere with state and local laws and regulations requiring warnings on food packages. Instead, this official said, a White House working group was set up to consider the matter. This group would include representatives of such agencies as the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. The official, discussing the meeting on grounds of anonymity, said the central question before the interagency working group is when and under what circumstances the federal government should act if it concludes that a state or local regulation harms interstate commerce. Among other things, the study group will try to determine whether Proposition 65, enacted by voters in 1986, duplicates or conflicts with the federal Food and Drug Act. Food industry officials who have criticized the state standards as unnecessary and costly, and they hailed the action as a victory. `` We think this is the formal beginning of a major policy review,'' said <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Nedelman </PERSON>, vice president for public affairs for the Grocery Manufacturers Association. `` We think we have a crazy situation on our hands, and before it gets really crazy, the government is going to take a real look at the problem.'' But environmental advocates in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> condemned the council's decision. `` This is a clear industry-orchestrated sneak attack directly on Proposition 65,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Roe </PERSON>, an attorney for the Environmental Defense Fund and a principal author of the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> initiative. The proposition, the Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986, requires that companies give <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> consumers a `` clear and reasonable warning'' if a product contains a chemical that poses `` a significant risk'' to their health. A variety of industries, including gasoline service stations, convenience stores and chemical plants, have posted warnings about the presence of chemicals known to cause cancer and birth defects. The state, however, has granted a temporary exemption from the warning requirements for food products, drugs and cosmetics that already meet existing federal and state safety standards. The state will analyze more than 50 chemicals that could be found in these products during the next two years to determine whether warnings should be required under Proposition 65. Food industry officials contend none of their products pose a danger to consumers. But they say they fear Proposition 65 may lead to putting warning labels on food packages to alert consumers to the presence of lead, arsenic or benzene, substances that are present in minute quantities in many common products.

 The dollar rose against major currencies Thursday, led by strong demand in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and boosted by word from <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> that a stronger dollar would not help the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit. Gold prices were mixed. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> quoted gold at a bid of $ 432.75 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, down from $ 433.45 late Wednesday.

The dollar got a spark from <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>'s testimony before a congressional subcommittee that the central bank was likely to tighten rather than loosen credit, which would tend to support the dollar. Analysts said <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>'s reiteration of the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s stance helped strengthen the dollar, due to speculation that interest rates could move higher, increasing the value of dollar-denominated investments. `` Interest rates domestically are going up.

 Merger and acquisition activity increased steadily during the first six months of 1988 while the dollar value of completed deals jumped 45 percent from a year ago, a financial information firm reported Thursday. <ORGANIZATION> IDD </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> said that 1,705 transactions were completed in the first two quarters, up from 1,622 in the first half of 1987. More impressive, perhaps, was that the deals this year carried a pricetag of $ 131 billion, up from $ 89.5 billion in the year-ago period, the firm said. Foreign investors snapped up <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies at a rapid pace, spending $ 25 billion on acquisitions in the first half of this year, up 67 percent from $ 15 billion in 1987. IDD attributed the interest _ led by <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> _ to a weaker dollar. Despite predictions of a decrease in activity following the October market crash, leveraged buyouts moved along at a brisk clip. In the first half of the year, <ORGANIZATION> IDD </ORGANIZATION> said there were 77 leveraged buyouts with a total value of $ 30 billion, compared with 58 buyouts valued at $ 20 billion a year ago. In a leveraged buyout, investors borrow against a target company's assets and repay borrowed funds from the company's cash flow. The use of tender offers as a way to acquire companies also increased dramatically. IDD said such transactions were valued at $ 75.9 billion, compared with $ 35.3 billion in tender offers a year ago. In terms of number of transactions completed, <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> led the pack of major investment houses by acting as financial advisor in 92 deals; followed by <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> with 77 and <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> with 70.

<HEAD>Money Supply Measures Move in Opposite Directions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The two broadest measures of the nation's money supply moved in opposite directions during the week ended July 20, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said the measure known as M2 fell to a seasonally adjusted $ 3,023.6 billion in the week ended July 20 from $ 3,027.4 billion the previous week. An even broader measure, M3, increased to a seasonally adjusted $ 3,819.8 billion from $ 3,817.4 billion. The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, fell to a seasonally adjusted $ 781.4 billion from $ 784.5 billion. M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations of $ 100,000. In judging its monetary policy, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has indicated it is monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the difference between short - and long-term interest rates It also has shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply measures The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said in mid 1988 that it reaffirmed its target for annual growth in M2 and M3 at between 4 percent and 8 percent, which is slightly lower than the 1987 target of 5.5 percent to 8.5 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has not set a specific target range for M1 since early 1987.

 <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday that its second-quarter earnings slid 24.5 percent compared with a year ago, and analysts said buyer incentive programs may have compressed results more than the company expected. The nation's No. 3 automaker said it earned $ 320.4 million, or $ 1.45 per share, in the three months ended June 30 compared with $ 424.1 million, or $ 1.98 per share, in the second quarter of 1987. The depressed profits due to rebate and incentives programs were a short-term sacrifice to boost market share and improve the company's long-term competitiveness, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> said. That game plan led to brisk sales, which should strengthen <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s standing in the marketplace, <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> said. `` You get a conquest -LRB- first time -RRB- buyer into your stable and hopefully you keep him,'' explained <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillippi </PERSON>, auto analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The results came on sales of nearly $ 8.5 billion in the second quarter, up 32.8 percent from $ 6.4 billion in the same period a year ago. `` The profit margins were very poor considering the level of business they did in the quarter,'' said analyst <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Healy </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> Lambert of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` They have been pushing heavily with incentives and the market share's gone up, but the results show the effect of it.'' `` They were a little bit under where they were going to come in -LRB- under the forecast -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Phillippi </PERSON> said. `` The principal reason, essentially as I read the number, was average yields per unit were down a little bit, and that reflects fleet sales, the cost of rebates and incentives ... It was essentially the incentives.'' <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s 20.7 percent share of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> truck market was up nearly two percentage points from the second quarter of 1987, the company said. Through June, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s combined <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> car and truck retail sales were up 16 percent from the same period of 1987. `` We're going after a bigger base of loyal customers, because that's what it takes to succeed over the long haul,'' <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> said. For the first half of the year, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s net earnings totaled $ 504.1 million, or $ 2.27 per share, down from $ 693.5 million, or $ 3.22 per share. The first half results include a $ 93.1 million charge for previously announced plant closings in the <ORGANIZATION> Acustar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary. First-half sales rose 30.6 percent to $ 16.16 billion from $ 12.44 billion a year earlier. During the second quarter, the nation's No. 3 automaker continued to hold the line on 1988 model prices, with 42 percent of the passenger cars it sells tagged below 1987 prices. `` That's paid off for us in higher market share, but we're caught in a classic case of ` margin squeeze,' and we ca n't rely on that strategy forever,'' <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> said `` We have seen that the incentives, in terms of rebates, have been coming steadily down for about six months,'' <PERSON> Phillippi </PERSON> said. `` The basic game plan, I think, in a sense among the executives at the three large companies, is to launch the new models without any meaningful incentives.'' On Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> announced a small price increase on the Colt GT for 1989, but said it would lower prices on two other Colt models. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s credit arm, made record earnings on the increased sales volume, reporting profits of $ 61 million for the second quarter of 1988 and $ 126 million for the first six months of the year, the subsidiary announced today. The results eclipse the previous quarterly high of $ 56 million, set in the second quarter of 1987, and a six-month earnings record of $ 117 million, also set a year ago, a company statement said. On Wednesday, No. 2 <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> reported an auto industry record second quarter, earning $ 1.66 billion, up from $ 1.50 billion in the second quarter of 1987. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the world's largest manufacturer, last week reported its second-quarter earnings _ $ 1.5 billion, compared with $ 1.17 billion in the comparable period of 1987

 Corn and sugar futures prices fell sharply Thursday in trading that analysts said was inspired by technical conditions and had little to do with fundamental supply-and-demand factors. Most wheat and soybean futures also slipped lower on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, and coffee futures joined sugar in falling for a third straight day on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Coffee, <ORGANIZATION> Sugar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. On other markets, precious metals were lower; cattle were up while pork futures plunged; and energy futures were mixed. Thursday marked the fifth consecutive day of falling corn futures prices and the ninth straight daily drop in the price for August delivery of soybeans. But in a departure from the past three months, the weather had little impact on the markets, analysts said. Instead, they said corn traders were watching their market's open interest, a rough measure of the number of speculators who have _ in effect _ placed their bets but not collected their winnings Open interest has been running at an unusually high level in the corn market and stood at more than 244,000 contracts when the market opened Thursday. The majority of the open interest was believed to represent `` long'' positions, or wagers that prices would rise. Since prices have been falling, some players feared that many holders of those long positions were preparing to sell and either cut their losses or settle for only a slight profit. A sudden, massive sell-off would cause prices to plummet and some traders tried to beat the rush by selling ahead of it, which caused corn prices to fall sharply anyway. The selling sentiment spread to the neighboring wheat and soybean pits, causing prices to fall in those markets, too, said <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Spilka </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s latest 6-to-10-day forecast, calling for normal rainfall next week in the drought-stricken <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, was bearish but it was not a major factor in Thursday's action, <PERSON> Spilka </PERSON> said `` I think weather forecasts are maybe contributing about half the influence right now -LRB- and -RRB- I think near-term forecasts are more important than the 6-to-10-days,'' he said. Wheat settled 4 cents to 5 -LCB- cents lower with the contract for delivery in September at $ 3.57 a bushel; corn was 14 -RCB- cents lower to 2 cents higher with September at $ 2.65 a bushel; oats were 3 cents lower to 7 -LCB- cents higher with September at $ 2.56 -LCB- a bushel; and soybeans were 12 cents lower to 15 cents higher with August at $ 7.41 -LCB- a bushel. The situation was similar in the sugar market, which ignored the bullish news of new sugar purchases by <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and plummeted to its lowest level in about a month. `` This was a technically driven sell-off,'' said <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Ganes </PERSON>, sugar analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Sugar futures have been extremely strong and stood at 6 -LCB- - year highs on Monday Ms. <PERSON> Ganes </PERSON> said the market fundamentals remained bullish and that the nearly 3 -LCB- - cent plunge over three days `` just gives you better bargains. Sugar for October delivery settled .53 cent lower at 10.82 cents a pound. Coffee futures continued their technically-driven decline with the September contract settling .26 cent lower at $ 1.2379 a pound. The continuing decline in the grain markets forced some speculators with additional holdings in silver and platinum futures to take profits in the metals markets so they could meet their financial obligations in the grain markets, said <PERSON> Bette </PERSON> <PERSON> Raptopoulos </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Gold was more stable in its traditional role as a `` safe haven'' for investment dollars, she said On <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, gold settled 70 cents to $ 1 lower with August at $ 432.50 a troy ounce; silver was 25.8 cents to 29.6 cents lower with August at $ 6.707 a troy ounce. Hog and pork-belly futures fell their respective daily limits of 1.50 cents and 2 cents a pound on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> because `` there's too much supply and not enough demand, period,'' said <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Cattle futures followed the grains to a mixed close, <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON> said Live cattle were .87 cent lower to .33 cent higher with August at 66.42 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent lower to .93 cent higher with August at 79.75 cents a pound; hogs were 1.12 cents to 1.50 cents lower with August at 43.87 cents a pound; and frozen pork bellies were 1.32 cents to 2 cents lower with August at 30.95 cents a pound. Crude oil prices were little changed in quiet trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> as traders waited for an upcoming <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> committee meeting. West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 1 cent to 2 cents lower with September at $ 16.15 a barrel; heating oil was .23 cent to .69 cent lower with August at 44.34 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .11 cent lower to 1.15 cents higher with August at 51.95 cents a gallon.

 Both houses of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> overwhelmingly approved some $ 6 billion in aid for drought-stricken farmers Thursday after scaling back provisions for special assistance to milk producers and ethanol fuel makers. `` Hold on _ help is coming in a sensible, rational compassionate way,'' <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman E. `` Kika'' de la <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, said as the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> gave 368-29 approval to its version of the bill. Within hours, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved 94-0 a similar bill but only after peppering it with scores of complex changes that may not be untangled before a <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> committee </ORGANIZATION> next week, at which lawmakers plan to fashion the final version. Congressional leaders aim to send the final product to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s desk by Aug. 11. The House had come under fire over a provision that would have increased on Oct. 1 the price-support level for milk to $ 11.10 for each 100 pounds. It would raise consumer costs by a few cents a gallon at most and cost the government $ 145 million by congressional estimate. The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> put the price tag at $ 300 million. Both the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> versions would cancel a 50-cent price-support cut set for Jan. 1 and the plan to actually increase the level was denounced by <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> as well as an array of business and farm groups that often are allies of the dairy industry on such matters. `` This is a most dangerous and wrongheaded precedent,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Kan </LOCATION>. He scoffed at claims that dairymen need the price increase to offset the increased cost of feed resulting from the drought, saying cattle and sheep ranchers and poultry producers are not getting anything similar in the way of a subsidy. The House moved to deflect criticism, adopting a compromise version sponsored by Reps. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Gunderson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Wis </LOCATION>., and <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Penny </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Minn </LOCATION> It would go ahead with the increase but only for April through June next year. Supporters said it would knock $ 30 million off the price tag. In the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, Sen. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Daschle </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.D. </LOCATION>, scaled back his plan to allow <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ethanol fuel makers to buy up to 2 million bushels each every month of government surplus corn. Ethanol is a fuel based partly on alcohol produced from corn and other commodities. Under <PERSON> Daschle </PERSON>'s plan, ethanol makers would be able to purchase the corn at 110 percent of the government's acquisition price. Much of the corn in <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> bins now was acquired long before the drought sent crop prices skyrocketing. The <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakotan </LOCATION> said he designed the provision to help small ethanol makers, but it could represent a substantial benefit for the the <ORGANIZATION> Archer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daniels </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Midland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the large <LOCATION> Decatur </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, corn processing company that makes the lion's share of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ethanol. In any case, <PERSON> Daschle </PERSON> won voice vote approval of an alteration that would terminate the program next Sept. 1 and limit the total use of corn in the program to 16 million bushels a month. Basic provisions of the bill would provide payments to drought-stricken farmers equal to 65 percent of their lost earnings above 35 percent of anticipated harvest. They also would expand and streamline government feed programs for dairy and livestock producers. Lawmakers have been struggling to keep their plan within tight budgetary limits and there has been concern about the possibility of excess spending within the bill. Rep. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, R-Pa., took to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor to denounce a $ 5.5 million project to control temperatures in the <LOCATION> Sacremento </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Shasta </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dam </LOCATION> and thus aid salmon spawning as `` this pork garbage. De la <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> defended the measure sponsored by Rep. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>., as one that would help to provide an adequate food supply to American consumers He said the measure was not merely to help farmers but to make certain that there was enough to eat on the grocery shelf. The House also approved a de la <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> amendment that would bring the cost estimate for the bill to $ 5.8 billion, down from $ 6.9 billion at the start of the day. Most of the decrease was accounted for by new limits on a program under which the government could pay half the cost of seeding burned out pastures. The measure sponsored by Rep. <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, D-Ala., was harnessed to the bill when the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> was racing to wrap up work and later estimated to have a $ 1.2 billion cost <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>'s amendment reduced the overall cost of the bill by shrinking the seeding provision. Even then, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, acknowledged Thursday morning that there was no way to be perfectly sure of exactly how much the drought bill would cost. Farm lawmakers have been saying that fiscal watchdogs worried about the spending level have nothing to complain about because it would be less than federal savings realized because of the drought. But <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said there was no certainty. `` The art of economics is not a precise one,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> and the parent of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday said their after-tax profit rose strongly in the latest quarter from a year earlier, boosted by revenue gains generated by growth in passenger traffic. <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the parent of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest airline, reported a 134 percent jump in second-quarter profit. Its earnings advanced to $ 124.2 million, or $ 5.77 a share. The profits surged past last year's second-quarter airline earnings of $ 53 million. The company actually earned a total of $ 73.4 million, or $ 1.29 a share, during 1987's second quarter, but that figure included profits from nonairline subsidiaries it has since sold. The number of <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> shares outstanding was sharply reduced during the period, to around 21.5 million in the second quarter of 1988 from 56.9 million in the year-earlier quarter. Second-quarter revenue rose to $ 2.34 billion from $ 2.07 billion a year earlier. Early this year, Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> completed the sale of its non-airline assets _ the <ORGANIZATION> Hertz </ORGANIZATION> car rental agency and the Westin and <ORGANIZATION> Hilton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> hotel chains. It changed its name from <ORGANIZATION> Allegis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which had been intended to signify its former status as a travel conglomerate. `` These results make it clear that <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> has returned to its core business of running an airline and doing so with the talent of 63,000 committed employees,'' said Chairman <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>, who took over the company last December following the ouster of former chief <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferris </PERSON>. In the first half of the year, <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>'s profit surged to $ 701 million, or $ 19.12 a share, from $ 42.8 million, or 79 cents a share, a year earlier. Earnings in the 1988 first half include a $ 548 million gain from the sale of <ORGANIZATION> Westin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotels </ORGANIZATION>. The number of shares outstanding dropped to around 36.6 million in the first six months of 1988 from 54.0 million in the same period of 1987. First-half revenue rose 13 percent, to $ 4.44 billion from $ 3.93 billion. Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>, the third-largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airline, reported a 76 percent boost in profit in the fourth quarter of its fiscal year ended June 30. <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>'s fourth-quarter earnings jumped to $ 103.28 million, or $ 2.11 a share, from $ 58.8 million, or $ 1.21 a share, a year earlier. The results for the latest quarter include a loss of $ 1.08 million, or 2 cents a share, from the disposition of aircraft and an $ 89,000 loss from foreign currency translation. Fourth-quarter revenue rose 19.1 percent, to $ 1.87 billion from $ 1.57 billion. Analysts said the airline probably benefited from troubles at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>'s main competitor. Miami-based <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> has been beset by labor and financial problems, including a federal safety inspection of its fleet, and last week announced the layoffs of about 4,000 employees plus the elimination of 140 flights. Prior to those cutbacks, <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> competed head-to-head with <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> on about 70 percent of its routes. For its fiscal year ended June 30, <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>'s profit rose to $ 306.83 million, or $ 6.30 a share, from $ 263.73 million, or $ 5.90 a share, in fiscal 1987. It was <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>'s first full fiscal year since its takeover of <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. Revenue for the fiscal year increased to $ 6.92 billion from $ 5.32 billion.

<HEAD>Major Maker of Ozone-Destroying CFC's Starts Producing
Alternatives</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a major producer of chemicals that are destroying the earth's protective ozone shield, said Thursday its plans were underway to begin producing alternatives to the chemicals by this fall. The company will modify an existing facility in <LOCATION> Montague </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, to produce alternatives to fully halogenated chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, by as early as October. <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION>'s are non-toxic, non-flammable compounds that <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> helped develop in the 1930s. They are widely used as refrigeration fluids, cleaning solvents, plastic form blowing agents, and outside the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, as aerosol propellants. <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> announced last March that it planned to move away from the production of <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION>'s in the next 12 years. The alternatives, to be used as blowing agents for a variety of insulation and cushioning applications, could be commercialized in five years, said company spokeswoman <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Forte </PERSON>. First the chemicals, HCFC-141b and HCFC-142b, must be tested to ensure they are not toxic. `` The ozone depletion rate of the new compounds is more than 95 percent less than existing compounds,'' <PERSON> Forte </PERSON> said. HCFC-141b is being evalutated as a replacement to CFCs used as insulating materials in refrigerators, refrigerated trucks and rail cars, homes and buildings, and as cushioning for automobile seats, furniture and bedding. HCFC-142b is being tested in the manufacturing of polystyrene insulation and polyolefin insulation and packaging. The plant will be one of three producing <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> alternatives. `` While our ultimate goal is to develop and commercialize non-ozone depleting products, we will continue to search for interim alternatives that will enable us to reduce dependence on fully halogenated CFCs in a stepwise fashion,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Glas </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION>'s Freon Products Division. About 2.3 billion pounds of <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> compounds are made worldwide each year, with more than 2,000 <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> employees producing about 25 percent of the total. The company says it gets $ 600 million annually from <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> sales, about 2 percent of its total sales revenue. Last fall in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>, major producers agreed on a treaty, now signed by 31 nations but ratified only by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, agreeing to cut <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> production 20 percent in 1992 and another 30 percent in 1998.

 <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday that its second-quarter profit more than tripled with an assist from a one-time gain from sale of two subsidiaries. The company also announced it has opened its books to about 10 different bidders seeking to buy <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the unit involved in exploration and production and refining and marketing that was put up for sale in May. For the three-month period ending June 30, the diversified energy company posted net earnings of $ 154 million, or $ 1 per share, compared with $ 46 million, or 24 cents per share, during the same period a year ago. The latest results include a one-time gain of $ 23 million related to the sale of <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of Gebr. Broere, a European shipping and storage company, and <ORGANIZATION> Mitchell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> heating oil retailing company. Revenue for the quarter rose 5.4 percent to $ 3.9 billion from $ 3.7 billion a year earlier. For the first six months of 1988, <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said its net income nearly tripled to $ 217 million, or $ 1.38 per share, from $ 75 million, or 32 cents per share, for the first half of 1987. Six-month revenue rose 6.8 percent to $ 7.9 billion from $ 7.4 billion. `` The core of businesses which will comprise <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> following the sale of the oil company reported strong profits with pipelines, automotive, packaging, chemicals and agricultural and construction equipment recording increases over last year,'' <PERSON> Ketelsen </PERSON> said. Each bidder for <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> gets one week to review the information, available through Aug. 25. The first round of bids is due Sept. 30. `` We've been very encouraged by the interest,'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ketelsen </PERSON>, chairman and chief operating officer of <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION>, said during a news conference. <PERSON> Ketelsen </PERSON> said potential buyers may bid on major segments or as a whole. He declined to disclose names of the bidders, who signed confidentialty agreements. When <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> announced plans to sell <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION>, it said it would use the proceeds to help pay its hefty $ 8.5 billion debt. Analysts have estimated that the sale could fetch between $ 5 billion to $ 7 billion. For the second quarter, the <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> unit recorded net income of $ 147 million, compared with $ 76 million for the same quarter in 1987.
