<TEXT>
 Wall Street braced for a possible battering Monday as aftershocks from its Friday the 13th plunge sent stocks and the dollar tumbling in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> and other foreign exchanges before they steadied in later trading. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 issues finished the morning session on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> down 407.84 points, or 1.16 percent, from Friday's finish at 34,708.18. The average opened down about 600 points but later rose in light-volume trading. The dollar opened in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> at 139.95 yen, down sharply from Friday's closes of 144.00 yen in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> and 142.05 yen in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, but by late morning was quoted at 141.30 yen. <PERSON> Yozo </PERSON> <PERSON> Asai </PERSON>, an analyst with the brokerage <ORGANIZATION> Yamaichi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, said there was some panic selling at the start of trading but the stock market was returning to stability. `` Market players in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> learned their lesson from Black Monday two years ago, so there will be no panic selling any more,'' <PERSON> Asai </PERSON> said. Market and government officials in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> continued their weekend-long huddle Sunday, mapping out strategies to prevent a financial disaster paralleling the events of two years ago, when the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> plummeted 508 points on Oct. 19, Black Monday, after a 108-point drop the preceding Friday. `` After what happened ... the powers that be will do a lot to avoid a major sell-off,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tierney </PERSON>, a vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> activity was the first in a major foreign market following Friday's plunge on Wall Street and was expected to help set the tone for trading as it opened in other markets around the world. Share prices in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> also fell, but not drastically, in opening trading Monday. On the <ORGANIZATION> Hong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, prices declined about 6 percent, or 163 points to 2,619 in the first 10 minutes of trading. On the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> exchange, blue-chip stocks tracked by the Barclays Index ended the morning off 265 points _ 11.79 percent _ at 1984.85, the biggest fall since the 505 points of the October 1987 crash. <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s main stock price index fell 8 percent in the first 20 minutes of trading but finished the morning down about 7 percent from Friday. In <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, the market's weighted index was down about 1.3 percent in late morning activity, after initially declining by 2 percent. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> stock market suffered its worst setback since the Black Monday crash when prices plunged in the final hour of trading last Friday and the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average lost more than 190 points to finish at 2,569.26. Since 1987, takeover rumors and leveraged buyouts had pushed the market higher. But trouble with one of those deals Friday, the employee-management buyout of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airines </ORGANIZATION> parent <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, raised fears of problems in the `` junk bond'' financing market and sparked Friday's sell-off. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> sent signals over the weekend that it will move quickly to meet any demands for cash on Monday, when a deluge of sell orders is expected to hit the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> markets. `` We will be there with all the liquidity demand that is needed,'' said a senior <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> official who spoke on condition of anonymity. `` If there are any doubts about liquidity being available, there is no reason to be concerned.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s action could keep bankers from cutting off credit to brokerage houses and securities firms suffering heavy losses from a plunge in stock prices. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> official said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> central bank had been in touch with central banks in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and had received assurances from them that those officials stood ready to supply needed cash in their countries to counteract any possible fallout from Friday's plunge in stock prices Officials at both the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> were closely monitoring developments in the overseas markets, primarily <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. Developments in those markets could set the tone for how <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> markets perform when they open Monday morning. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> planned to open its computers to receive orders at 7:30 a.m. EDT, an hour earlier than usual. Thousands of worried investors called sell orders into their brokers over the weekend, setting the stage for a flood of activity when Wall Street opens for business. The exchange plans to institute a service at the opening, which puts individual orders of up to 2,099 shares in front of big, institutional orders, said the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s chief spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Torrenzano </PERSON>. Normally, the service is offered only after the Dow moves up or down 25 points. `` You go on a red alert when there's a situation like Friday,'' said <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Gamsin </PERSON>. `` We want to pave the way for the system to operate as smooth as possible. We're not anticipating any problem.'' Once the market opens, a system of `` circuit breakers'' installed following the 1987 crash will automatically halt trading if the Dow rises or falls 250 points. <PERSON> Gamsin </PERSON> said the exchange intends to let the market `` go,'' rather than step in before the circuit breakers have a chance to work. Insiders say a drop on Wall Street might be cushioned if corporations and brokerages step in to buy stocks. After the crash two years ago, companies stepped in to purchase their own shares to bolster prices. Observers said the same thing could happen this time, with brokerages joining in to support the stocks they have been touting through the market's recent record-setting runup. Experts are quick to note that the economic landscape two years ago was markedly different. Higher interest rates and a weak dollar had the effect of `` creating expectations of a big economic slowdown'' and looming inflation, <PERSON> Tierney </PERSON> said. But lower interest rates, a strong dollar and continued growth are providing a firmer foundation this time around. `` People -LRB- have had -RRB- two days to sober to the fact that the economy is not falling apart,'' said <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, senior vice president at <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Albany </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>.

 A tour bus full of weekend gamblers flipped on its side on a rain-slickened highway in downtown <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> on Saturday. Forty-two people were injured, none seriously, authorities said. The Scorpio Tours bus was carrying passengers from <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> when it crashed in the northbound lane of Interstate 15 at about 4 p.m. Driver <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Figuearera </PERSON>, 51, said through an interpreter he lost control when he braked for a car in front of him, officials said. They said the bus fell on its left side. `` I just saw a lot of cars getting tangled up. Then I saw a cloud of dust and the bus was in the middle of the cloud of dust and then it just went over on its side,'' said <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Clark </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> firefighter who was driving home when he saw the crash. A tractor-trailer rig following the bus also swerved out of control and collided with a car, but no injuries were reported. It was raining lightly. Passengers escaped through a rooftop escape hatch and the driver's broken windshield. The driver and 41 passengers were taken to five hospitals. The worst injury reported was a broken pelvis, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Forbuss </PERSON>, president of Mercy Ambulance.

 Declaring that he has an `` unfinished agenda,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON> said Saturday night that he would run for a fifth term. The announcement by the <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> ended months of speculation about the plans of the state's most popular politician. `` I've come to the conclusion that ours is an unfinished agenda,'' <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON> said told about 350 supporters. <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON> said he played a key role in fashioning the recent congressional compromise on harvest of old growth timber. Environmentalists had initally opposed harvesting any virgin timber on federal land; the compromise allows some logging. `` I will not rest until we have secured a long-term solution to our timber supply problems,'' <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON>, 67, also said that if re-elected he would work to provide better health care to Oregonians, to step up the fight against drugs, and to slow the nuclear arms race. Following a long-standing tradition, <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON> made the announcement in <LOCATION> Silverton </LOCATION>, where he's launched all of his previous campaigns. Friends and political supporters of <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON>, including President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, had encouraged the senator to run again.

<HEAD>Union Official Charges ``Witch Hunt'' By Airline</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A union official said Saturday that allegations that <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> ticket agents kept ticket money are part of a `` witch hunt'' by the airline. Four ticket agents at <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> have been charged with stealing about $ 1,400, said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Cahill </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Port </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, which runs the airport. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Port </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> have determined that $ 48,000 is in fact missing,'' said <PERSON> Cahill </PERSON>. He said <ORGANIZATION> Port </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> detectives are investigating the four agents and and possibly others in the disappearance of the $ 48,000. <PERSON> Cahill </PERSON> had previously indicated that the four arrested were charged with stealing the total $ 48,000, but he said Saturday he was mistaken. The four agents were charged Friday with falsifying records and larceny for allegedly selling one-way tickets and keeping the cash instead of putting the money in the register, <PERSON> Cahill </PERSON> said. One of the agents, <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Alam </PERSON>, is charged with taking just $ 38, <PERSON> Cahill </PERSON> said. An official of the union that represents the agents blasted the charges, calling it part of a scheme by <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> to get rid of some union employees. `` I think this is just a witch hunt,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Miranda </PERSON>, vice president of Local 732 of the airline division of the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION>. `` I do n't think these people were involved in a sophisticated scam involving that amount of money,'' <PERSON> Miranda </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Cahill </PERSON> said $ 48,000 is missing in receipts for August and September and that <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Authority </LOCATION> detectives believe ticket agents may have been keeping cash payments for about a year. The investigation, conducted at the request of the airline, will continue and more arrests are expected, <PERSON> Cahill </PERSON> said. A <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> spokesman did n't immediately respond to a telephone request for comment.

 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is unable to get rid of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> because the military strongman has compromising films involving senior <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> officials, a British newspaper reported Sunday. The Sunday Correspondent, a new independent weekly, also said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> asked <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> for help shipping arms to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Contra rebels, according to secret documents declassified during the Iran-Contra investigation. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' relationship with the general is curious and raises disturbing questions,'' the paper said. The newspaper said that for years <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> invited senior officials from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and administration to his <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> villa on the <LOCATION> Azuero </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>. It did n't name any officials. There, he supplied his guests with girls or boys in bedrooms wired for sound and equipped with hidden cameras, the paper said. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> stored the films `` as an insurance policy for the future,'' according to the newspaper. The weekly quoted <PERSON> Curtin </PERSON> <PERSON> Winsor </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> from 1983 to 1985, as saying he received such an invitation from <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s brother in 1985. <PERSON> Winsor </PERSON> told the paper he checked out the invitation with <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Briggs </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, who told him he would be spending the weekend in `` one of the most notorious ` honey-traps' in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The report said <PERSON> Winsor </PERSON> turned down his invitation but many other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials accepted. `` I ca n't give you names, but look around,'' the weekly quoted <PERSON> Winsor </PERSON> as saying. `` Who's soft on <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>? That's where you should look.'' The newspaper quoted <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregorie </PERSON>, the former <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> prosecutor who brough drug-trafficking charges against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, as saying he was disgusted by what he called the sham nature of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> war on drugs. The newspaper said documents released during the Iran-Contra trials showed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wanted permission to use <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s `` secret drugs and arms airfields.'' <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Blum </PERSON>, former counsel to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, was quoted by the paper as saying, `` If drugs came back to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> as a result then the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration turned a blind eye.'' The paper also quoted <PERSON> Blum </PERSON> as saying the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> gave <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> `` all kinds of mixed signals,'' a mixture of public condemnation and private encouragement. <PERSON> Blum </PERSON> told the paper that a 1986 <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> policy review recommending strong action against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was shelved after `` higher levels'' told the department to forget it. The paper said Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON>, D-Mass., requested last year that the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> ask government agencies for information on <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, however, banned any agency from giving out information, the paper said. The Sunday Correspondent is only five weeks old. It is not connected with any other British newspaper group but the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> is among its financial backers.

<TEXT>
 A real estate developer is getting some help from the <ORGANIZATION> Feds </ORGANIZATION> in his quest to transform <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Capone </PERSON>'s former headquarters, once an opulent palace of sin, into a respectable hotel for business travelers. The Lexington Hotel, on <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s Near South Side, was the plush Prohibition Era haven where <PERSON> Capone </PERSON> ruled his criminal empire in the late 1920s and early'30s, before he was sent to federal prison on an income tax-evasion rap. Today, the abandoned building is a neighborhood eyesore, despite its city and federal landmark status. Broken liquor bottles litter the boarded-up main entrance, next to an abandoned blues bar. The masonry exterior is dotted with cracked terra cotta decorations and broken bay windows. Real estate developer <PERSON> Ganesan </PERSON> <PERSON> Visvabharathy </PERSON> wants to change all that. The Indian-born Visvabharathy plans to transform the 10-story building into a 258-suite hotel geared to business people attending events at the nearby McCormick Place exhibition center. <PERSON> Visvabharathy </PERSON> said he did n't know about the hotel's past when he responded to a real estate ad in June 1988. He bought the property for $ 600,000 from the <ORGANIZATION> Sunbow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, a non-profit group that trains women for construction jobs. But <PERSON> Visvabharathy </PERSON> said <PERSON> Capone </PERSON>'s legacy was an added incentive for him to proceed with plans for the $ 28.6 million rehabiliation project. `` A lot of people would consider <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Capone </PERSON> something like a negative, but in my opinion that's exactly why you should use it as a positive thing to market the hotel,'' said <PERSON> Visvabharathy </PERSON> in a recent interview. `` If you go anywhere in the world, people may not know anything about <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, but they know <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Capone </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Visvabharathy </PERSON>, 41, who left <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> in 1974 to study for his doctorate in business administration at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION>. Last month, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> awarded an Urban Development Action <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> to the <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION> rehab project. The $ 2.6 million grant will be used by the city to make a low-interest loan to <ORGANIZATION> Vilas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Properties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the real estate development company <PERSON> Visvabharathy </PERSON> started in 1982. A partnership formed by <PERSON> Vilas </PERSON>' company is investing $ 3 million and the remainder of the money will come from bank loans and city development bonds. Visvabharathy plans to begin construction in late November, and the restoration should be completed by November 1991. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON>, the commissioner of the city's <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, says he's excited about the project. `` It will breathe some new life into a neighborhood that we are very interested in,'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> said. `` If we can facilitate some tourism and interest using one of our more notorious former residents ... I can certainly live with that.'' The <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION> opened in 1892 and was one of the city's first high-rises. President <PERSON> Grover </PERSON> <PERSON> Cleveland </PERSON> honeymooned there and society's elite once danced on the lavish ballroom's tiled floors. When <PERSON> Capone </PERSON> made the hotel his headquarters, he occupied the fourth and fifth floors. Part of the hotel was converted to a brothel, and there was a network of underground tunnels and secret stairways. The <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION> was renamed the New Michigan Hotel after World War II. A bordello and finally a flophouse, it was closed by court order in 1980. <PERSON> Visvabharathy </PERSON> says little is salvagable inside _ except for some tile flooring from the ballroom and tiles in the bathroom of <PERSON> Capone </PERSON>'s four-room suite. He plans to faithfully restore <PERSON> Capone </PERSON>'s suite, including its lavender bathtub, but it wo n't be rented out to guests. Instead, it will be a tourist attraction. In 1986, the <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION> drew attention when television's <PERSON> Geraldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> blasted open a sealed basement chamber billed as <PERSON> Capone </PERSON>'s secret vault in a live TV broadcast All that was found were a few empty whiskey bottles and an old sign.

 <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON>, senior leader of the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and colleague of <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, was freed at dawn Sunday after 26 years in prison. Seven other political prisoners also were freed. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, the most prominent jailed leader of the outlawed guerrilla movement, remains in prison, although his release within the next months is widely expected. <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON>, 77, arrived under police escort at his home in <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> and embraced his wife, <PERSON> Albertina </PERSON>, an activist who was under severe police restrictions until Friday. Youths who had been waiting for <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON> lifted the white-haired, bespectacled black nationalist atop their shoulders before he went inside. `` I feel very well,'' <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON> told reporters. `` I am inspired.'' Also freed early Sunday were the seven other prisoners whose impending unconditional release was announced Tuesday by President F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>. These include four other men arrested in 1963 and sentenced to life prison terms in 1964 along with <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Mandela </LOCATION> _ <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Mlangeni </PERSON>, 63, <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> <PERSON> Mostsoaledi </PERSON>, 65, <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Kathrada </PERSON>, 60, and <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Mhlaba </PERSON>, 68, as well as <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> leader, <PERSON> Wilton </PERSON> <PERSON> Mkwayi </PERSON>, 67, who was sentenced to life in prison in a separate 1964 trial. The group also includes 80-year-year <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> activist <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mpetha </PERSON>, who had been hospitalized in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Jafta </PERSON> <PERSON> Masemola </PERSON>, 58, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africanist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla movement who lives outside <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mpetha </PERSON> was serving a five-year prison term for terrorism. <PERSON> Masemola </PERSON> was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1963. <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON>, who arrived home in a gray suit and blue tie, emerged after about three hours to speak to reporters and give a clenched-fist salute to a crowd of 300 well-wishers outside his home, some waving <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> flags. Asked if he had feared he might die in prison, <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON> said: `` I was quite prepared for death. But I knew the pressure was building for our release, and I never despaired.'' <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON> conferred at his home with several anti-apartheid leaders. The freed <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> leaders are expected to apply for passports to travel to <LOCATION> Lusaka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>, for consultations with the guerrilla movement's exiled leadership. Although the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> remains outlawed, the release of <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON> and his colleagues has been widely viewed as a tacit acknowledgement by the government of the movement's influence and popularity among <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s black majority. Even relatively conservative black leaders have said they will reject any negotiations with the government unless the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> is legalized and its jailed leaders freed. In recent weeks, the government has permitted <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> flags and posters to be displayed openly at mass protests, something not allowed before <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> took power in mid-August. Symbols of the guerrilla movement were in evidence Saturday, when more than 100,000 blacks joined in marches mationwide protesting government policy and celebrating the imminent release of the eight prisoners. Organizers said never before had so many large anti-government marches been held in the country simultaneously. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, 71, conferred with Justice Minister <PERSON> Kobie </PERSON> <PERSON> Coetsee </PERSON> and other government officials before the announcement of the prisoner releases. There has been increasing speculation that <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> does not want to go free until the government takes further steps to legalize <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> political activity. `` The <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> leader clearly understands the power he wields,'' wrote political analysist <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Staden </PERSON> in The Star newspaper of <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> on Sunday. `` If, by remaining in jail, he can achieve the unbanning of his and other organizations and strengthen the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>'s position in the negotiation process, then his own history suggests he will opt for the tough choice.'' <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> has offered to negotiate a new constitution within five years that would extend political rights to the disenfranchised black majority, but he envisions some arrangement in which whites would retain veto power over major decisions. Black leaders say meaningful talks can not begin until the state of emergency is lifted, the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> is legalized and all political prisoners are freed.

 A eulogy comparing <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> was `` ridiculous, absurd and an insult to the Filipino people,'' <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>'s top Roman Catholic official said Saturday. `` I sincerely regret the gross abuse of the Catholic Mass as a forum to make yet another blatantly political statement regarding the late <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, former president of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>,'' the Roman Catholic Bishop of <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferrario </PERSON>, said in a written statement. During a funeral Mass Friday at the Co-Cathedral of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Theresa </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Monsignor </PERSON> <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON> <PERSON> Nebres </PERSON>, a priest from the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, eulogized his longtime friend as a man who suffered like <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> and forgave those who betrayed him. `` Christ was a victim of the people's power, so <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was a victim of the people's power,'' he said, referring to the 1986 `` people power'' revolt that ended <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' 20-year rule in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. After the Mass, <PERSON> Nebres </PERSON> told reporters he was not comparing <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> in terms of power, but in suffering. <PERSON> Ferrario </PERSON> said <PERSON> Nebres </PERSON>, who does n't have a <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> parish, was allowed to say the Mass only after agreeing he would n't to give a eulogy or say anything political. `` He gave us his word that he would follow these directions. His comments at the Mass violated these instructions,'' said <PERSON> Ferrario </PERSON>. `` Furthermore, we consider his comparison of <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> as ridiculous, absurd and an insult to the Filipino people.'' <PERSON> Nebres </PERSON> defended himself Saturday, saying his comments were personal, not political, and that he spoke only of <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' suffering, especially during his three-year exile As for the instructions against giving a eulogy, <PERSON> Nebres </PERSON> said, `` When someone is dead in front of you, you must give him a little glory as a comfort to his family and those who loved him.'' <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> died Sept. 28 at age 72 after being hospitalized for nearly nine months. His body was to be entombed Sunday at the Valley of the Temples Memorial Park in what his family called `` a temporary resting place.'' His widow, <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON>, has vowed to return the body to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> someday for burial.

 The Church of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> said Sunday it has been assured by a reliable Iranian informant that missing church envoy <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waite </PERSON> is alive on his 1,000 th day in captivity The unidentified source also provided assurances that two other Britons missing in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, journalist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> and Northern Irish teacher <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON>, are alive, said <PERSON> Eve </PERSON> <PERSON> Keatley </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for Archbishop of Canterbury <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON>. <PERSON> Waite </PERSON>, 50, the archbishop's personal emissary, vanished in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on Jan. 20, 1987, while trying to negotiate the release of two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hostages. He was on his fifth mission to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, and is widely believed to have been taken captive by Iranian-backed Shiite Moslem extremists. `` We have had further assurances this weekend from Iranian sources that the three British hostages are alive,'' Ms. <PERSON> Keatley </PERSON> said. `` We still have no concrete proof of this,'' she said. `` The information comes via a channel that we think is reliable but which we do not wish to identify.'' A prayer by the archbishop was being said Sunday at churches across <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. `` Give <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> a sense of your abiding presence and the assurance that fellow believers are one with him in spirit; encourage him and all other hostages to face each new day in confidence and hope; and grant that they may soon be restored to those whom they love,'' it said. On Sunday, <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> had been missing for 1,278 days and <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON> for 1,283 days.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> is ready to move large amounts of cash into the American banking system on Monday if the money is needed to prevent a financial crisis sparked by a sharp drop in stock prices, it was reported Sunday. Flooding the banking system with money could reduce the risk that Friday's 190-point fall in the Dow Jones average will turn into a more serious financial disaster on Monday, the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported. `` Markets will be able to count on us to make sure the financial system stays fluid,'' the Times quoted an unidentified official of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> as saying. On Monday, `` it should be quite evident to the market that we will satisfy liquidity needs. Our action in the market should make it clear,'' an unnamed <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> official told the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. Liquidity refers to the ready availability of cash. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s promise is aimed at preventing a repeat of the Wall Street situation two years ago, when the market fell 508 points in a single day. On the day before that fall, the stock index had fallen 108 points, leading mutual fund shareholders to cash in their shares. As the mutual funds ran low, they had to sell more shares to raise money, which in turn caused stock prices to drop even lower. `` To calm the markets it's important that institutions know there are adequate funds available,'' the official told the Times. `` Once the markets realize there will be no credit crunch, we can resume normal business.'' According to the unnamed official quoted by the Times, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s decision was taken at a meeting late Friday and was being communicated to officials in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> this weekend

<TEXT>
 Tropical Storm <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> picked up strength and shifted a bit westward Sunday, and forecasters said the storm's center should make landfall in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> by early Monday and could bring dangerous flooding and near-hurricane-force wind. Storm watches were posted from <LOCATION> Morgan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, on the central <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> coast, westward to <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> O'Connor </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, on the central <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> coast. Watches east of <LOCATION> Morgan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> were withdrawn. Earlier, the storm watch had covered most of the <LOCATION> Lousiana </LOCATION> coast but only small parts of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Storm winds were clocked at 65 mph this morning, up from 60 mph overnight. `` Some slight increase in strength is likely before landfall, possibly bringing the winds to near hurricane force,'' Bb Sheets, director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hurricane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in suburban <LOCATION> Coral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gables </LOCATION>, said in an advisory. Tropical storms become hurricanes when sustained winds reach 74 mph. A storm warning was expected to be issued later Sunday for part of the watch area, forecasters said. They warned of severe coastal flooding because of the combination of coastal tides, which are expected to reach a peak this weekend, and the storm's surge. `` Astronomical tides are expected to be the highest of the year this weekend, and in combination with storm-surge water levels this could produce dangerous coastal flooding, depending on the exact path of the storm,'' Sheets said. At 9 a.m. EDT, the center was located near latitude 27.7 north, longitude 94.0 west, or about 115 miles south-southeast of <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The storm was moving north-northwest at about 10 mph, bringing the center near the upper <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> late Sunday or early Monday, said Sheets.

 Most of the 6,500 residents forced to flee when a frozen pizza plant leaked deadly ammonia gas were allowed back into their homes early Sunday, but people with breathing problems were told to wait. Authorities ordered a complete evacuation of the town Saturday night when the gas, used for refrigeration, began leaking and spread quickly over an area of about half a mile, said Fire Department Lt. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Winters </PERSON>. Twenty-four people affected by the gas were taken to hospitals and four were admitted, officials said. Many others were given oxygen by paramedics who rushed to the scene from around the largely rural southeastern quarter of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. The anhydrous ammonia leak at the <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Jeno </PERSON>'s plant was brought under control by 10:55 p.m., said Mayor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Carey </PERSON> Assistant Fire Chief <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON> said people started returning to their homes just after 5 a.m. Sunday. `` The fog is still heavy. It's starting to lift up a little and it smells kind of funny. You get a little odor of it,'' <PERSON> Long </PERSON> said. The mayor warned that the elderly, people with breathing problems and small children could be affected by remaining vapor and should remain away from the town until the ammonia dissipated completely. Police had ordered people to evacuate a seven-block area near the plant, then expanded the order to cover the entire town as the gas spread, said Highway Patrol Dispatcher <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON>. Sheriff's deputies went door-to-door ordering people out of their homes. Resident <PERSON> Vicki </PERSON> <PERSON> Dailey </PERSON> said she, her husband and two children fled choking fumes about 9 p.m. `` We were out in the driveway and at first could not smell anything,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Dailey </PERSON> said. `` But within about two minutes, we started smelling it and decided to get out. We were choking.'' Repair crews working breathing bottled oxygen reported the leak came from a ruptured 16-inch pipe, but the cause of the break was n't known, said <LOCATION> Vinton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Deputy Sheriff <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. Anhydrous ammonia fumes can be fatal if inhaled, according to an emergency guidebook by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION>.

 Blacks remain disenfranchised and the white minority remains in charge, but other aspects of South African politics have changed markedly in the quarter-century since <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON> and his colleagues went to jail. Black trade unions, banned at the time <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON>, <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> leaders received life prison terms in 1964, now claim more than 2 million members and have the power to cripple the biggest industries. A network of militant anti-apartheid groups has formed in black townships across <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, linking churches, students, women and workers in an organizational framework that was not available to <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON>'s hometown, the vast black township of <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>, remains an all-black ghetto providing a work force for <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, but it now includes posh two-story homes as well as cramped matchbox houses and shanties. More Sowetans commute to work in black-owned taxis than in white-owned buses. In <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> itself, several inner-city neighborhoods have become thoroughly multiracial, even though laws mandating residential segregation remain on the books. When <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON> went to jail, virtually every type of public facility in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> was segregated _ toilets, elevators, parks, libraries, theaters, restaurants. Blacks and whites waited in separate lines at post offices. Those segregation policies crumbled one by one, and the city's final segregated amenities were opened up last month <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON> now can ride buses, swim in swimming pools and patronize recreation centers that formerly were reserved for whites. Segregated facilities remain in some other parts of the country, but the government has hinted that the law allowing such segregation may be headed for abolition. Public hospitals and schools remain segregated, but the number of multiracial private schools has mushroomed since 1964. Many more blacks have moved into professional and technical jobs, including skilled mining jobs that until two years ago were exclusively for whites. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s international isolation has intensified steadily since 1964. That was the first year the country was barred from the Olympics, and it now is excluded from international competition in almost every sport. A cultural boycott also is in effect, as are numerous trade embargoes, and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has been excluded from the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> since 1974. Anti-apartheid activism among South African whites was rare in 1964, outside a small ciricle of communist-oriented intellectuals aligned to the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>. There was one anti-apartheid legislator, <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Suzman </PERSON>, in Parliament. Now there are 34, with the anti-apartheid <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> having won 20 percent of the votes in the Sept. 6 general election. Whites produce lively anti-apartheid newspapers, perform in anti-apartheid rock bands and, in increasing numbers, journey abroad to confer with the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>'s exiled leaders. Major changes also have taken place within the governing <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. In 1964, it unashamedly touted its `` grand apartheid'' policy of relocating blacks into rural tribal homelands, theorizing that the blacks could satisfy their desire for political rights in the homelands while whites tightened control over the other 87 percent of the country. The homelands still exist, but the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> now acknowledges that the blacks in `` white'' <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> are permanent residents who must be given a political role. Efforts to stem the flow of blacks into urban areas have eased, and the government abolished the so-called pass laws that required blacks in `` white'' areas to have permits. The new president, F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, also is different from the government leaders of the 1950s and early 60s. Since taking power, he has pledged to eliminate discriminatory laws and negotiate a new constitution within five years that would extend political rights to blacks. However, <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, like his predecessors, opposes a one-person, one-vote system that would lead to black majority rule. He envisions some mechanism through which whites would maintain a veto power over major decisions, something <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON> and his freed colleagues are likely to find unacceptable.

 Palestinian leaders met Sunday in the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> capital seeking a common strategy toward <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Egyptian proposals for direct <LOCATION> Palestinian-Israeli </LOCATION> negotiations. <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> was expected to come under pressure from hard-liners to reject recent peace proposals by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which have either ruled out <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> participation in peace talks or left its role vague. The <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> convened at the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s `` embassy'' in downtown <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> under tight security. The council, comprising 80 members, acts as an intermediary between the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s policy-making body, the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, and the 15-man Executive Committee. <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul-Rahman </PERSON> said it will discuss `` all peace ideas that have been floating in recent months and will issue a policy statement.'' He did not say how long the meeting would last. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> proposed in May that elections be held in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> to allow Palestinians to choose their own representatives under a plan for limited self-rule. But he ruled out <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> withdrawal from the territories, the creation of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state, or participation of Palestinians outside the occupied territories in the elections. Egyptian President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> proposed a modified 10-point election plan that urged <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to accept the concept of trading land for peace and enter into direct talks with the Palestinians. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> did not mention the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> invited the foreign ministers of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Esmat </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel-Meguid </PERSON> and <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON>, for talks in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> but also ignored the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. Radical Palestinians, mainly <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Habash </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nayef </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawatmeh </PERSON>, have been pushing for outright condemnation of the proposals. <PERSON> Habash </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> faction, has warned <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> he could suffer the same fate as his predecessor <PERSON> Anwar </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON> was killed by Egyptian radicals in October 1981, two years after he signed the Camp David peace treaty with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hawatmeh </PERSON>, who leads the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> for the Liberation of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>, said: `` We are totally opposed to the <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> and <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> plans which are only a new version of the ill-fated Camp David accords.'' `` Only the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> can choose <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> representatives to any dialogue,'' he told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> before the meeting began.

<HEAD>Thatcherism in Trouble, Looking for Change</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Last week's annual Conservative Party convention revealed Thatcherism to be in trouble and striving for a kinder, more caring image. Conservative conventions traditionally are designed less to thrash out policies than to cheer the leader and unite the troops. But this one seemed jinxed. With the pound sagging and inflation resurgent, interest rates were pushed up to 15 percent, an eight-year high, just five days before the convention opened in the seaside town of <LOCATION> Blackpool </LOCATION>. Then, as Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> was winding up the convention with a rousing defense of her record, it was announced that the annual inflation rate had crept up from 7.3 percent to 7.6 percent. Finally, as the delegates headed home Friday, Wall Street slumped and left British business facing a jittery weekend. To compound Conservative worries, the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has been topping the opinion polls for the past four months, and its lead averages seven points. That's normal against a government in midterm, say Conservative loyalists. But after a decade in the wilderness, the socialists under <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON> are beginning to look like credible challengers again. At Labor's convention the previous week, vote-losing doctrines like unilateral nuclear disarmament were formally dumped, and the militant left, which had frightened off many voters in the past, was thoroughly sidelined. Moreover, the centrist bloc in Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s party that has helped keep her in power by garnering votes from Labor has disintegrated, and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> is back to straight two-party politics. None of this means an imminent end to Thatcherism, with its hatred for socialism, distrust of trade unions and faith in market forces. No election need be held until mid-1992, and Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, who turned 64 last week, looked her usual vigorous, combative self. Even after 10 years in office _ an eternity by British standards _ she remains securely in charge, revered by her supporters as the warrior who slew the trade union dragon, liberated the marketplace from socialist regulation and restored <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s self-esteem. But even her best friends are telling her she's in trouble. When interest rates rose yet again, the conservative Daily Mail demanded the resignation of Chancellor of the Exchequer <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>, who only a year earlier was being hailed by Conservatives as a miracle worker. The pro-Thatcher Sunday Times reversed its past assessments and concluded bluntly that `` There was no British economic miracle in the 1980s after all.'' Once again, it said, the country faced `` the perennial problems of the British economy _ rising prices, balance of payments deficits ... inflationary wage demands, slow growth and the huge structural rigidities which hold <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> back.'' At the convention, many delegates were asking why, after 10 years of Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s harsh medicine, inflation and high interest rates are still around. `` Many people are feeling rather let down,'' delegate <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said Thursday. `` They are rather upset that after 10 years of Conservative rule we should have got into these rather difficult times.'' In the longer term, the convention was significant for the signals it sent out that Thatcherism is preparing for change. Speakers seemed at pains to present a more compassionate brand of Conservativism, even though that implies spending more taxpayers' money on public services and would have been regarded with suspicion by Thatcherite purists. There was an unexpected government pledge of $ 1.6 billion to cushion Britons against an unpopular new property tax. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> assured delegates that the cherished <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> was not going to be `` privatized'' on <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> lines, as some had feared. An expected promise to sell off the state-owned railroads never materialized. The volatile issue of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s place in a united <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> failed to stir any fuss. Promises to protect the environment and enhance the quality of life got big cheers. Former <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Heseltine </PERSON>, a leading contender to succeed Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, railed against `` polluted rivers, filthy streets, bodies bedded down in doorways -LRB- which -RRB- are no advertisement for a prosperous and caring society.'' The overall theme, said the liberal Guardian newspaper, was the need to adjust to `` a coming decade where the old tunes have lost their resonance.'' The more conservative Times said that with Conservatives and Labor both moving to the center, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> might have `` a quite different political landscape in the 1990s.''

<HEAD>Pope Condemns Modern Influences, Says They Endanger Families</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PORT LOUIS, Mauritius (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> said Sunday that technological advancements such as television are threatening traditional family life on this <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> island nation. `` Modern life has reached the shores of the island. Asphalt roads and electricity arrive the same time as the means of social communication'' such as television and videos, the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> told a stadium full of Roman Catholics on the tiny island of <LOCATION> Rodrigues </LOCATION>, 390 miles east of the main island of <LOCATION> Mauritius </LOCATION>. `` In itself, this is praiseworthy progress, but, as in other societies, <PERSON> Rodrigues </PERSON> suffers in full from influences such as those of the video that threaten stability in the family,'' the pontiff said. The 36,500 French-speaking inhabitants of <PERSON> Rodrigues </PERSON> are mainly African-descended farmers and farm workers. About 97 percent are <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>. The pope expressed concern about the growing number of islanders leaving to seek jobs in the booming economy on the main island, where he arrived Saturday after eight days in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>. He returns to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> on Monday. `` For a long time, <PERSON> Rodrigues </PERSON> seemed to be living tranquilly as one big united family in which everyone knew everyone else and no one was an outcast,'' said the pope. `` And suddenly, there is worry about the future.'' He urged the islanders to safeguard traditional values in a country where tourism has doubled in the past six years to about 200,000 annually. Cardinal <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Margeot </PERSON> has warned that the influx of outsiders is creating serious `` moral'' problems for Mauritians. As the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> toured the island, topless European and South African women sunned themselves on beaches in a land where most native women wear long dresses and do n't smoke or drink alcohol. In the past six years, 90,000 jobs have been created on <LOCATION> Mauritius </LOCATION>, a democracy where people of several races and religions coexist peacefully. The government of Prime Minister <PERSON> Anerood </PERSON> <PERSON> Jugnauth </PERSON> has actively courted foreign investment, creating a special export zone to diversify the economy from its centuries of dependence on sugarcane. But Mauritians have become concerned about pollution as factory smoke begins to cloud the sharp-edged mountains around the lagoons and gas stations appear alongside the palm trees. The government last year created a department to monitor the quality of life and financed it from liquor and cigarette taxes. <LOCATION> Mauritius </LOCATION> also has become a transit point for drug smugglers. Signs at the international airport warn of a death penalty for trafficking in narcotics.

 Communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> on Sunday denounced the arrests of six students who stormed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador's residence in rival <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> last week. The official government newspaper <PERSON> Minju </PERSON> <PERSON> Choson </PERSON> declared: `` The action of the <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> students was an eruption of towering indignation at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> imperialist aggressors who have established a colonial fascist rule over <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>.'' On Friday, six students stormed the official residence of <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. They hurled homemade bombs and smashed artwork with iron bars, but <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Meg </PERSON>, escaped unharmed through a side entrance. <PERSON> Minju </PERSON> <PERSON> Choson </PERSON>'s commentary, broadcast by the North's <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, said the arrest of the students `` is a repressive outrage which could be done only by the pro-U.S. flunky-ist traitors who can not live a day without the patronage of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. imperialists.'' It added: `` The <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> students took over the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador's residence and held an anti-U.S. sit-in, strongly demanding a negotiation with the ambassador, a <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> agent, cancellation of the traitor <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON>'s planned trip to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> states </LOCATION> and stop to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pressure on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to import its agricultural and aquatic products `` This was an entirely just act,'' the newspaper said. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>, the South Korean president, left Sunday for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to confer with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and address a joint session of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> was a <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> station chief in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> in the 1970s.

<TEXT>
 If visitors to this museum get the feeling they're being watched by hundreds of eyes, they're right. After all, they're standing in the Potato Museum. Surely one of the smallest museums in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, if not anywhere in the world, the Potato Museum occupies the basement of a yellow-brick rowhouse on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> that is the home of <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> and <PERSON> Meredith </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, a fun-loving couple of spud fanatics, and their 5-year-old son, <PERSON> Gulliver </PERSON>. Gulliver's nickname, naturally, is `` Tater Tot.'' Filling the two tiny basement rooms are 400 items from the <ORGANIZATION> Hugheses </ORGANIZATION>' collection of 2,000 potato artifacts, from a bronzed, heart-shaped potato donated by a Canadian woman to a <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> inventor's digital `` Tater Time Clock'' which runs _ believe it or not _ on electrical current supplied by the acids in two attached potatoes. `` The goodness of the potato knows no bounds,'' the couple gushed in a tuber tome they wrote in 1986, titled `` The Great Potato Book,'' extolling the virtues of their favorite vegetable. Visitors to the private, non-profit museum are welcomed by Mrs. <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> with a slide show of potato folklore, accompanied by tapes of such top tuber tunes as `` Cold Tater Stomp'' or Weird <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Yanokovich </PERSON>'s `` Addicted to Spuds.'' Then her husband, a schoolteacher in suburban <PERSON> McLean </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, invites guests to become couch potatoes and enjoy his videotape of `` great moments in potatoes'' from <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> movies. The scenes include <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> snacking on potato chips in `` The Seven-Year Itch'' and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dreyfuss </PERSON> making a mountain of his mashed potatoes at the dinner table in `` Close Encounters of the Third Kind.'' Q: What was the biggest potato ever grown? A. An Englishman named <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Seddal </PERSON> is reputed to have harvested a monster spud weighing 18 pounds, 4 ounces on Feb. 17, 1795. Q. What was the biggest single serving of mashed potatoes in history? A. An 18,260-pound mound of instant mashed potatoes, prepared in a cement mixer truck for the annual Potato Bowl football game at Grand Forks, <LOCATION> N.D. </LOCATION>, in 1982. The museum's shelves are stuffed with potato toys -LRB- including a `` Spudomatic'' air pistol that shoots potato pellets -RRB-, a burlap potato sack jacket, potato posters, dolls and postage stamps, a 1948 <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> `` World Famous Potatoes'' license plate and some 4,000-year-old potatoes preserved in a jar. There's also a cluster of antique potato chip cans, a basket of deep-fried potato skins woven by the chef at <PERSON> Antoine </PERSON>'s Restaurant in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, and a staggering assortment of implements and kitchen appliances _ potato mashers, slicers, peelers, scrubbers, hoes, rakes, planters, baskets, diggers and beetle sprayers. One rack displays sample products made from potatoes _ Polish vodka, hand lotion, ice cream, bread, a sheet of paper, a necklace and `` autochromes,'' an early color photographic process using potato starch _ which also is used to make candy and glue. <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> says potatoes fueled German rockets in World War II, and once were used as money by the island people of Tristan da <PERSON> Cunha </PERSON>. They're good for treating acne, sunburn and toothaches, he claims, and they make great chicken feed. The Potato Museum began in 1975, when <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> asked his fifth-grade pupils at the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brussels </ORGANIZATION> to prepare an exhibit showing why potatoes are so important in <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>. The Belgians grow potatoes in backyard gardens the way Americans grow tomatoes, he says, and their `` frites'' _ which Americans mistakenly call French fries _ are the most delicious in the world. Artifacts from that classroom project formed the nucleus of the museum, which moved to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> with the <ORGANIZATION> Hugheses </ORGANIZATION> in 1983. The independent, tax-exempt museum gets most of its financial support from membership dues, souvenir sales and a grant from a potato research center in <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>. For $ 20 a year, members receive six issues of the museum's newsletter, `` Peelings,'' and invitations to occasional potluck dinners where the all-potato menu ranges from pickled potato hors d'oeuvres to a dessert made of chocolate-laced mashed potatoes <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> says he and <PERSON> Meredith </PERSON> have two ambitions: to visit the Chilean island where Spanish explorers found potatoes and introduced them to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in 1570, and to take a cruise on a newly built Japanese potato tanker. The <ORGANIZATION> Hugheses </ORGANIZATION> love potatoes because they're not only good eating, but they're fun and friendly. `` They are a comfort food when we feel lonely, sick or sad, but we also see something of ourselves in them,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, cuddling a spud in her hand. `` Look, it has eyes, a head, a face. It's somehow almost human.''

<TEXT>
 While World War II still raged, an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> serviceman had a burst of inspiration and painted a giant picture of the famed B-17 bomber on a brick wall at a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airfield. The B-17 is ancient aviation history now, and the airfield is used as a drag-racing strip. The name of the fatigue-clad artist is barely remembered. But the mural that stood in obscurity since 1944 has been taken down as part of a plan to restore it and move it to a permanent place of honor. `` It was a thrill to see something that has been in the dark for more than 40 years come into the light again and be saved for posterity,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nimmo </PERSON>, one of a group of English enthusiasts who seek to perserve such relics. The picture _ which shows the famous `` Flying Fortress'' unloading its bombs while anti-aircraft shells burst around it _ was taken down Saturday from its place at <LOCATION> Podington </LOCATION> airfield, an old base of the World War II-era <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 8th <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Podington </LOCATION> airfield, 65 miles north of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, was one of about 130 8th <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> bases for bombers and fighters in the eastern <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> flatlands. They were established to raid <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and German-occupied territory. After the war, most of the <LOCATION> Podington </LOCATION> field reverted to farming. The brick huts used by the crews have remained as workshops for drag-racing on the airfield runway, and the control tower has been converted into a house. The mural was on a piece of wall on farmland. The removal team had to get permission from the farmer to take down the painting, and they will have to rebuild the wall. A benefactor has given them 750 red bricks for the task. With help from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> air base at <LOCATION> Alconbury </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, the mural is to soon be transported to <LOCATION> Duxford </LOCATION>, another old <ORGANIZATION> 8th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> field about 35 miles east of <LOCATION> Podington </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> War </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> maintains <LOCATION> Duxford </LOCATION> for its collection of historic aircraft and will set up the B-17 mural as part of its display about the <ORGANIZATION> 8th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>. The 12-by-8 foot painting was done in about 1944 by a staff sergeant named <PERSON> Walderschmidt </PERSON>, <PERSON> Nimmo </PERSON> said. `` We think he was on the ground crew,'' he said. `` We do n't know anything else about him except that we heard he is still alive in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. We do n't know his first name or where he lives.''

 Forty of the country's top singers have pooled their talents to record a song that pleads for peace on this ethnically torn <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> island. The new song was titled `` Give Peace A Chance'' and sung in the Tamil, Sinhalese and English languages. It was played this weekend on state-run radio and television. `` Our song, the first sung jointly by 40 top vocalists, is to achieve peace in our country, where everybody cries for just that,'' said composer <PERSON> Sunil </PERSON> <PERSON> Perera </PERSON>. Tamils, who are mostly Hindus, make up 18 percent of the island's 16 million people. Militant Tamils have been fighting since 1983 for an independent homeland in the northeast. They allege they are denied jobs and education by the predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sinhalese </ORGANIZATION>, who make up 75 percent of the population. More than 11,000 people have died in the Tamil rebellion. Another 5,000 have been killed in the backlash by Sinhalese extremists that started two years ago.

A 16-hour, 94-mile tour Saturday of the towns and several captured artillery bases showed they were firmly under the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>'s control. Field commanders said the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> was attacking <LOCATION> Svey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chek </LOCATION> in uncommon coordination with its two partners in the resistance coalition, the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> and the forces of Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>. The guerrillas are trying to topple the government <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> installed after it invaded <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in late 1978. Their attacks intensified after <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> made what it called the pullout of its last troops from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> on Sept. 26. Capturing <LOCATION> Sisophon </LOCATION>, a major military base for operations in northwestern <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, would be a major victory for the guerrillas, who have not seized any areas of such significance. The tour began at a <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> base along the <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> border south of the <LOCATION> Dong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ruk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> mountains </LOCATION>, where the guerrillas showed off captured equipment _ more than 1,000 automatic rifles, heavy machine guns, mortars, many cases of anti-personnel mines and teletype machines with Soviet lettering. The journey into <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> was on motorcyles, with about 20 <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas. It was slow and grueling, covering roads drenched by monsoon rains. Everywhere were captured artillery positions, virtually all capable of hitting Site 2, the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>'s major civilian base just inside <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>. Three destroyed tanks, four destroyed heavy trucks and heavy artillery guns were abandoned on the roads. Everywhere were former government soldiers who had defected to the guerrilla side. The three captured towns appeared only lightly defended and there were no signs the guerrillas expected a counteroffensive. Civilians farmed in the fields, seeming to go about their lives normally. The twisted remants of two tanks sat at the edge of <LOCATION> Banteay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chmar </LOCATION>, blasted by anti-tank weapons the guerrillas recently acquired. Some guerrillas have said the weapons may change the course of the war the way the acquisition of Stinger missiles did for the guerrillas in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Children played around the destroyed tanks. Hundreds of residents greeted the guerrillas arriving in the town with a religious ceremony, and <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> division commander Gen. <PERSON> Koh </PERSON> <PERSON> Chien </PERSON> made a speech and gave money to a village headman and to <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monks. The town had been guarded by 300 or 400 government soldiers, said village head Ta Rah, 64. `` The -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- attacked and they all left right away,'' he said, laughing. The guerrillas radioed for a car after one motorcyle in the convoy broke down. The driver of the Soviet-made military transport truck that arrived was a former government soldier who brought the vehicle when he defected. Asked if he missed home, he said: `` No. We want to stay with the KPNLF.'' The truck's left front wheel struck a land mine just after passing a guerrilla base at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lo </LOCATION>. The mine apparently had been planted by government troops as they abandoned the base in a recent guerrilla attack. Both of the driver's legs were blown off, and he later died. Several passengers, including this reporter, were wounded. The vehicle burned.

 Just a few years ago, opera audiences and critics were bemoaning the lack of any new <PERSON> Verdi </PERSON> sopranos to fill the void left by the retirement of Leontyne Price. Then came a young American upstart named <PERSON> Aprile </PERSON> <PERSON> Millo </PERSON>. On Saturday came another _ <PERSON> Alessandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Marc </PERSON>. Even in a Metropolitan Opera season notable for exciting debuts, <PERSON> Marc </PERSON>'s first performance as `` Aida'' was something special, as the standing-room-only crowd acknowledged with its repeated ovations. Here is the genuine article _ a dramatic soprano with an opulent voice that can be thrilling in its power or tender in its warmth as the occasion demands. She has the gleaming tones to ride above the full forces of orchestra and chorus that <PERSON> Verdi </PERSON> assembled for the Triumphal Scene of Act 2. She has the artistry to create a portrayal of the tormented Ethiopian princess in the aria `` O patria mia,'' which opens the Nile Scene in Act 3. She also has a few problems. Vocally, the lower register of her voice is undeveloped and colorless. At the other end of her range, she has trouble reining in the volume and seems unable to float the high pianissimos that are one of <PERSON> Millo </PERSON>'s trademarks. Dramatically, <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> is hampered by being enormously overweight, a condition that makes believable involvement with the other characters difficult. In one of the opera's most moving scenes, her father, <PERSON> Amonasro </PERSON>, is supposed to throw Aida to the ground in angry rejection. The most that baritone <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> could do was push her gently and allow her to slump on a nearby rock. <PERSON> Marc </PERSON>, who is in her early 30s, grew up in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, area, as <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Borden </PERSON>. She changed her name a few years ago, saying she was tired of being confused with the soprano <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Blegen </PERSON> and wanted a name with a good international ring to it. She has the name. Now it's up to her whether she will have the career to match. The rest of Saturday's `` Aida'' was workmanlike but undistinguished. As the wooden hero, Radames, tenor <PERSON> Nicola </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinucci </PERSON> strained at his high notes; mezzo <PERSON> Stefania </PERSON> <PERSON> Toczyska </PERSON> was earnest, if not thrilling, as the villainous Amneris, and <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> brought warmth and intensity to the brief role of <LOCATION> Amonasro </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Badea </PERSON>'s conducting was lively and sensitive. <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> is the second American singer to make a triumphant debut this season at the Met, a company often criticized for being too slow to engage promising native talent. Two weeks ago, tenor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Leech </PERSON> sang <PERSON> Rodolfo </PERSON> in <PERSON> Puccini </PERSON>'s `` La Boheme'' to great acclaim. <PERSON> Millo </PERSON>, who has been singing major roles at the Met for several years, got to open the current season as `` Aida.'' There's more to come. The coloratura June <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> will debut in <PERSON> Verdi </PERSON>'s `` Rigoletto'' later this fall; <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON>, another contender in the <LOCATION> Verdi </LOCATION> sweepstakes, sings in `` Il Trovatore'' in February, and soprano <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> <PERSON> Putnam </PERSON> will sing in Gounod's `` Faust'' in March.

 A top secret government program known as the Doomsday Project is leaving a bitter legacy, with a veteran counterintelligence expert alleging he is being harassed for reporting improprieties and poor management. The program, referred to at the Pentagon simply as Project 908, is designed to ensure that even if top <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> civilian leaders are killed in a surprise nuclear attack, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can still unleash its own atomic weapons on the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. So far, the government has spent $ 4 billion to $ 5 billion to build supply depots, underground bunkers and a communications network that has been plagued with problems, say <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> sources, speaking on condition of anonymity. The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> inspector general's office reviewed the program in 1987 and interviewed <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> civilian employee <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Golden </PERSON>. Golden, chief of the operations security branch at the <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huachuca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, asserted to the IG that: _ The communications network vital to the project did n't work properly, was costing hundreds of millions of dollars to fix and Project 908 officials on several occasions misled members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> into believing that the system was operational when in fact it was n't _ The son of <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brig </ORGANIZATION> Gen. <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Renzi </PERSON> was doing work for <ORGANIZATION> Betac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, an <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, firm to which <PERSON> Renzi </PERSON> had directed a sole-source, no-bid contract in connection with Project 908. _ The Betac contract specified that one of <PERSON> Renzi </PERSON>'s aides would be a $ 400-a-day consultant to the company Army regulations say the inspector general will protect the anonymity of witnesses, but within weeks of <LOCATION> Golden </LOCATION>'s confidential discussions, word had leaked to <PERSON> Renzi </PERSON> that <PERSON> Golden </PERSON> was making allegations against the general. Golden alleged that Col. <PERSON> Ned </PERSON> <PERSON> Bacheldor </PERSON>, chief of the inspector general's intelligence oversight division, had informed <PERSON> Renzi </PERSON> that <PERSON> Golden </PERSON> was the source of the allegation about <PERSON> Renzi </PERSON>'s son. <PERSON> Renzi </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> investigators in sworn testimony he had found out about <PERSON> Golden </PERSON>'s allegations from an aide, not from <LOCATION> Bacheldor </LOCATION>. The Army inspector general's office concluded that <PERSON> Renzi </PERSON> had retaliated against Golden by spreading word that <PERSON> Golden </PERSON> would not be welcome at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ritchie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Renzi </PERSON> directed the 7th Signal Command. `` Because of ... <PERSON> Renzi </PERSON>'s action,'' Golden's effectiveness `` was diminished'' and `` he could not do his job,'' according to an <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> memo obtained by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. Golden requested reassignment and now handles counterintelligence matters in connection with the Strategic Defense Initiative. <PERSON> Renzi </PERSON> was reprimanded for retaliating against <PERSON> Golden </PERSON>, but has since been promoted to the rank of major general and is stationed in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Renzi </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bacheldor </PERSON> and Golden all rejected interview requests made through military spokesmen. But the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> has learned that <PERSON> Renzi </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> investigator late last year that <PERSON> Bacheldor </PERSON> had leaked Golden's name to <PERSON> Renzi </PERSON>'s boss, Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Emmett </PERSON> <PERSON> Paige </PERSON>, who passed it along to <PERSON> Renzi </PERSON>. <PERSON> Golden </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> recently he still is being targeted for retribution. Two officials in Project 908 `` have engaged in a smear campaign against me,'' <PERSON> Golden </PERSON> said in a letter to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> obtained by The <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> from sources on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. Security chief <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartford </PERSON> and legal counsel <PERSON> Ernie </PERSON> <PERSON> Peluso </PERSON> tried to obtain Golden's telephone records in an effort to link him to a reporter for <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; World Report who wrote an article about Project 908, Golden alleged. <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Peluso </PERSON> work at the Defense Mobilization Systems Planning Activity, a key Project 908 component where <PERSON> Bacheldor </PERSON> is now chief of staff.

<HEAD>Congressional Report Finds Little Cutback Within U.S.S.R.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is on schedule in withdrawing forces from <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> but has made little progress on military reductions within its borders, says a congressional report released Sunday. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> study found that since late April the Soviets have been pulling back their forces as part of reductions proposed by President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> on Dec. 7, 1988. However, the withdrawal of six tank divisions, 50,000 men and 5,000 tanks from <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> has not been carried out as Western observers expected. `` Rather than withdrawing a tank division in its entirety, the motorized rifle regiment assigned to it is being transferred to a division that would remain in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and a tank regiment from that division withdrawn instead,'' the report said. A motorized rifle regiment is similar to a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mechanized infantry. Thirteen members of the committee traveled to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in early August, a 13-day trip that included visits to an East German military unit, a motorized rifle division in <LOCATION> Yavorov </LOCATION> and an intermediate-range nuclear forces elimination facility in <LOCATION> Sarny </LOCATION>. The report was based on observations by the legislators and defense experts who traveled with the delegation. The committee's assessment is consistent with comments made by <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> last month in releasing the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> study, `` Soviet Military Power.'' <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said that while the Soviets are unilaterally withdrawing some ground forces, they are reorganizing and modernizing their general purpose forces, upgrading their communications networks and researching future generations of weapons systems. The congressional report said there is `` great uncertainty about what the Soviets will do with the equipment being removed from their forces.'' Specifically, the study found that tanks withdrawn from <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and slated to be destroyed or converted, will likely replace older equipment in units within the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The study concluded that `` Soviet forces are clearly being pulled back from <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> into the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, but little is known so far about what is happening to <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> forces inside the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> had vowed to reduce Soviet forces west of the <LOCATION> Ural </LOCATION> mountains by 10,000 tanks, 8,500 artillery pieces and 800 combat aircraft. The timetable for the reductions and withdrawals is two years. Based on observations of its members, the committee concluded that `` while <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> must be careful to avoid taking any actions that are more difficult to reverse than those happening on the other side, it is not too soon to take advantage of the changes already taking place on the ground, namely the withdrawal of Soviet forces from <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.''

<HEAD>NBC's Ratings Streak Set to End After 68 Weeks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN HORN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s remarkable command of the weekly TV ratings will almost certainly end this week, as a resurgent <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> _ helped by its World Series broadcasts _ makes a bid for the Nielsen pennant. For the first time in 68 weeks, even <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> is convinced it wo n't be No 1 in the <ORGANIZATION> A.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> ratings issued Tuesday, ending a winning streak unmatched in television history. `` I'm sorry it's come to an end, but I hope we start a new streak soon,'' said <PERSON> Brandon </PERSON> <PERSON> Tartikoff </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION>'s president `` I'd like to start a new one as soon as the last out is made at the World Series.'' Odds are long, though, that <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> _ or any other network _ soon will assemble such a string of triumphs. The previous record of 46 weeks on top was set by <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> in the 1962-63 season. Not only is the network sweepstakes increasingly competitive, but upcoming blockbuster sporting events like the Super Bowl, on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, and next year's baseball playoffs, on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, are divided more evenly. `` I do n't think we're going to match real soon, and I do n't know if anybody will match it,'' <PERSON> Tartikoff </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s reign over the ratings _ used to determine advertising rates, and thus the key to a network's fortunes _ stands apart for several reasons. First, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> succeeded mostly without appealing to the lowest common denominator, winning 25 Emmys last month, second only to <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' 27. Second, the streak survived such highly touted miniseries as <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` War and Remembrance'' and <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` Lonesome Dove.'' Third, even last summer's screenwriters' strike, which threw the 1988-89 season into chaos, did n't derail <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>. `` Raw numbers do n't tell the whole story,'' <PERSON> Tartikoff </PERSON> said, because the streak came `` in the most competitive environment that's ever existed.'' CBS' record ride as No. 1 `` took place in a day and age when there was no World Series in prime time, there was no Super Bowl in prime time and there was no such thing as movies for television or miniseries,'' he said. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> believes its expected ratings victory wo n't last long after the World Series. Such modesty aside, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> has started the new season strongly. In last week's ratings, it had seven of network television's top 10 programs and finished within eight-tenths of a ratings point of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> for the week. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s working-class situation comedy `` Roseanne'' was the highest-rated program of the week, with a rating of 27.8, its highest ever. The other <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> shows in the top 10 were `` The Wonder Years,'' `` Who's the Boss?,'' `` <ORGANIZATION> NFL </ORGANIZATION> Monday Night Football,'' `` Chicken Soup,'' `` Growing Pains'' and `` Head of the Class.'' The rating is the percentage of the 90.4 million homes with TV sets in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, with each point equivalent to 904,000 households. While <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> is burdened by the low-rated `` Mr. <PERSON> Belvedere </PERSON>,'' `` Homeroom'' and `` Living Dolls,'' among others, its schedule is fairly solid on every week night except Thursday. Since 1984, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> has dominated Thursday with `` The Cosby Show.'' `` Cosby,'' more than any other series, was responsible for <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s rise from the ratings trash heap So low had <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> fallen earlier this decade that in the 1981-82 season it did n't have one show in the top 20. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s streak also was the result of sophisticated marketing, promotion and scheduling. Last November, against the upscale `` War and Remembrance,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> delivered mass-market hits like `` Back to the Future,'' `` The Karate Kid Part II'' and the Vanna White quasi-movie `` Goddess of Love.'' Although <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> did n't want the streak to end, there is some consolation for the network in not having to maintain the succession any longer. `` With the streak over ... we can nurture a fragile show _ tomorrow's ` St. Elsewhere' or tomorrow's ` Cheers.' Now, we wo n't get itchy trigger fingers'' and pre-empt shows to guarantee another ratings win, <PERSON> Tartikoff </PERSON> said

<TEXT>
 The Education Department is expanding the scope of its regional strategy sessions to include initiatives beyond `` choice,'' after months of wrangling with the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> about the meetings' limited agenda. Education Secretary <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> opens the first session Monday night, when he meets with <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, parents. A daylong session, complete with a plenary and concurrent workshops, will follow on Tuesday. `` Our purpose in calling for these meetings is to ratchet up the debate about the importance of choice in the move to restructure schools,'' said Education Undersecretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>. Choice is the concept that allows parents to decide where their children will attend school. It is based on the theory that competition will shake up and improve bad schools. However, Rep. <PERSON> Augustus </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, had argued that the Education Department's strategy sessions should address other proposals for education reform <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> said he and several committee members object to `` choice'' because `` we believe it's a new way of resegregating the schools.'' He added that some disadvantaged children also may be forced to give up needed services in order to attend a school outside the district. He said the department has relented and that the meetings will include other ideas and that opponents of `` choice'' will be allowed to talk. <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, D-Calif., bristles at the cross-country `` choice'' blitz that will take the education secretary to <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> over the next two months `` Why have they selected one program in education, which is not authorized -LRB- by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- and not included in the package that we passed last year?'' said <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, pointing to an outline of the `` School Improvement'' Act. The new law reauthorizes virtually all major federal elementary and secondary education programs through fiscal year 1993, including Chapter One for the disadvantaged, science and math programs, magnet programs for specialized instruction, bilingual education and child development. <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> said the new law `` provided for some accountability at school districts to document improvements over each year,'' as well as local control. `` Full funding and implementation of the School Improvement Act of 1988 assures precisely that kind of choice, and I urge you to make it your most immediate and top priority,'' said <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> in a letter to <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON>. `` Real choice comes about when all parents get involved on a daily basis with the education of their children, whether they attend magnet schools or not,'' said the letter. `` Administrators, teachers, parents and their children working together for school improvements in each school building, as required in the Chapter One -LRB- for disadvantaged children -RRB-, for instance, will help to bring about improvements for all children, not just those who attend certain select schools.'' <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON> acknowledged that the new law `` addresses accountability and local control, yes,'' but stressed that `` it deals specifically with federal programs. It gives new accountability measures within those programs. We're talking about -LRB- something -RRB- much broader. We're talking about the system itself. Since he could not stop the meetings, <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> said he worked for months before he got the Education Department to agree to allow other education reform programs to be discussed and opponents of `` choice'' to participate. <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> also received an invitation to attend but it was uncertain whether he would. Reps. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>, are expected to attend, along with participants from <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> will address the meeting. The most controversial form of school choice is allowing parents to send their child to a school outside their school district. But other initiatives include magnet schools that specialize in certain subjects, alternative programs and teacher-initiated schools. So far this year, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> have joined <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, whose open enrollment plan went into effect this past school year. Many other states offer more limited choice options aimed at gifted students or youngsters with academic problems that only certain districts can handle. Chapter One is given to schools that have a large concentration of disadvantage students and are located in low-income areas. Expected high transportation costs also will limited the options of low-income parents, <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Shrimpers could be fined $ 8,000 or more starting Monday if caught with nets that lack turtle excluder devices, gates that allow endangered sea turtles to escape from the nets without drowning. Shrimpers, who had hoped that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would grant a last-minute reprieve, complain that the devices, known as TEDs, cause them to lose nearly a third of their catch. Government studies have shown losses of 5 percent to 10 percent. Although shrimpers have been required to use TEDs since Sept. 8, until Sunday the federal government had forgiven the penalties _ at first in whole and later in part _ if a shrimper bought and installed a TED after being caught without one. But beginning Monday, a shrimper can be fined $ 8,000 for a first offense and $ 15,000 for a second. A third offense could cost $ 15,000 and confiscation of the shrimper's vessel, catch, or both. The change in enforcement wo n't change how the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> monitors shrimp boats, said Lt. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> LaRochelle </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION>. `` What we've been doing in normal law enforcement operations is stopping boats randomly while in the water,'' <PERSON> LaRochelle </PERSON> said. `` If we happen to stop shrimp boats we'll check for TEDs.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> reports violations it finds to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, which imposes the penalties. `` Our policy remains unchanged. We still continue to look for TEDS in routine boardings. As far as the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> is concerned, there was never a stoppage of that,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petty </ORGANIZATION> Officer 2nd Class <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Morehead </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Philben </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, said compliance with the TEDs regulation is improving. He and <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Proulx </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> enforcement official, agreed that compliance is very good off <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and good along <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, but said it is poor off <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>. <PERSON> LaRochelle </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> officials in the <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION> area have reported about 50 percent compliance of TEDs on shrimp boats they searched. <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Zirlott </PERSON>, a fisherman in <LOCATION> Mobile </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, said most <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> shrimpers have tried TEDs, but few continued to use them.

 Sobbing refugees and their children scuffled with <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> troops Sunday who blocked them from returning to Turkish-occupied northern <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> from the Greek sector of the divided island. Police estimated the number of demonstrators at 3,000 and stopped most of them from bursting into the U.N.-patrolled buffer zone splitting <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> into Greek and Turkish sectors. But about 200 demonstrators, mainly women and children, managed to push through lines of police and <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> and Danish <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping troops. After repeated scuffles, they broke through the three successive lines to penetrate about 500 yards into the buffer zone. They were stopped before reaching the fortified Turkish lines, about 500 yards away. `` We ask you not to proceed further as we can not guarantee your safety,'' a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officer repeatedly said through a bullhorn. Some troops roughly pushed back the refugees. Others chased children and young teen-age boys and girls, bringing some of them down with flying tackles. Armed Turkish troops and Turkish Cypriot riot police stood on the outskirts of the village on the far edge of the buffer zone. `` That's my home over there, you have no right to stop me,'' 17-year-old <PERSON> Niki </PERSON> <PERSON> Avraamidou </PERSON> shouted, exhausted after trying repeatedly to push through a line of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> troops. <PERSON> Erene </PERSON> <PERSON> Figuri </PERSON>, 60, holding her 9-year-old grandson <PERSON> Tofis </PERSON> by the hand, argued angrily with Danish peacekeepers. <PERSON> Tofis </PERSON> slipped through the cordon several times while the soldiers were scuffling with older people, only to be chased and brought back each time. Other demonstrators sat at the edge of the buffer zone, singing religious hymns and songs of yearning about their lost homes and waving Greek and <LOCATION> Cypriot </LOCATION> flags and banners. `` Our right to return is not negotiable,'' said one huge cloth banner. A series of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolutions on <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> call for the return of the 200,000 Greek Cypriot refugees expelled from their homes after the Turkish invasion of 1974. The resolutions also demand the withdrawal of the 30,000 Turkish troops and 35,000-50 ,000 Turkish mainland settlers brought to northern <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> The Turkish Cypriot leadership rejects the right of any of the Greek Cypriot refugees to return. The buffer zone, which splits the island, effectively prevents any contact between the two sides. It was the fourth attempt this year by Greek Cypriot refugees to walk back to their homes. On two of the earlier attempts, refugees were beaten by Turkish Cypriot police, arrested and jailed for `` illegal entry'' into the breakaway Turkish Cypriot state, which was proclaimed unilaterally in 1983 and has only been recognized by <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. U.N.-sponsored peace talks between President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cypriot </LOCATION> leader, and <PERSON> Rauf </PERSON> <PERSON> Denktash </PERSON>, the president of the breakaway state, have been deadlocked since June.

<TEXT>
 Pro-democracy activists said Sunday they will demonstrate in the city of <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> despite a Politburo statement last week saying street demonstrations pose an obstacle to a dialogue on reforms. Also Sunday, there was growing speculation that a meeting of the ruling Politburo later this week could determine the political future of hard-line Communist leader <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>. A high-ranking <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> official called on the government to allow free elections by secret ballot and warned the Communist leadership not to dismiss pro-democracy activists as `` enemies of the state.'' Activists in <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> said the protest would go ahead as planned Monday night despite the Politburo statement condemning demonstrations. Last Monday, more than 70,000 people took part in a pro-democracy march in <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION>, the largest single protest in almost four decades. The demands for more freedom in this rigidly controlled country have spurred more than 52,000 East Germans to go West in recent months. The West German mass-circulation <ORGANIZATION> Bild </ORGANIZATION> newspaper reported Sunday that the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> will hold a special session this week that could formally decide <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>'s future. <ORGANIZATION> Bild </ORGANIZATION>, quoting unidentified `` reliable sources'' in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, said the meeting would be Thursday or Friday, following a session of the Politburo set for Tuesday. <ORGANIZATION> Bild </ORGANIZATION> said its report would appear in Monday's editions of the newspaper. The report was sent by telex to other news media in advance of publication. <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> has led the country as <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief since 1971. Party sources have said leaders in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> are unhappy over the way <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> has handled the current unrest and that he has lost support in the 163-seat Central Committee. Any final decision regarding <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>'s leadership role would have to be approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Bild </ORGANIZATION> also reported that more than 20,000 East Germans, unhappy over the leadership's rejection of reforms, have canceled their party membership in the past two weeks. Lutheran Bishop <PERSON> Werner </PERSON> <PERSON> Leich </PERSON> called on the government to allow free elections and urged all sides to refrain from violence. `` Future elections must serve the purpose of renewal and must provide a clear choice by secret ballot of candidates and -LRB- political -RRB- platforms,'' said <PERSON> Leich </PERSON>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> German </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Leich </PERSON>, in a pastoral letter, also appealed to East German security officials to show restraint during peaceful pro-democracy demonstrations. He said the government must open a dialogue with all levels of society _ not just political groups and organizations already in place. `` Critical voices can not simply be dismissed as enemies of the state, not even the new groups that have formed in our society,'' said <PERSON> Leich </PERSON>, referring to the growing pro-democracy movement in the rigidly controlled nation of 16.6 million. <PERSON> Leich </PERSON> is also bishop of the <LOCATION> Thueringen </LOCATION> region in southwestern <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The 77-year-old <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> has flatly refused to talk with pro-democracy groups.

 Hundreds more East Germans flocked to the West German Embassy here over the weekend, bringing to more than 1,200 the number expected to leave for the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> beginning Monday. The exodus also gained strength elsewhere. More than 2,100 East Germans made their to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> over the weekend by escaping through <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, which opened its western border to refugees Sept. 10. At the West German Embassy on a tree-lined street in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, 200-300 new refugees arrived over the weekend, diplomatic sources said. That brought the total to more than 1,200. East German Trabant cars lined the street in front of the embassy, and Poles continued to buy them at a brisk pace _ handing cash to the refugees, taking the keys and driving off. East Germans were seen arriving throughout the day. In the afternoon a group of refugees in the embassy compound were moved to temporary shelter elsewhere. In a decision announced Saturday by the Polish state news agency <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> said the refugees will be allowed to obtain exit documents in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> and then travel directly to any country they choose. It appeared that arrangements for the departure from <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> were still being made Sunday. A West German official in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> said the first departures could come Monday. Refugees said they were told <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> was arranging transport for them either by plane or ferry. Those arriving at the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> embassy Sunday included a family that persuaded East German authorities to let them travel to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> by presenting a holiday invitation from a Polish family. The father said he decided to leave because of the fierce police crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrations that swept <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> during ceremonies marking the 40th anniversary of the country's founding Oct. 7 The man said he was shocked by the repression. `` My protest was to leave,'' he said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Other refugees also cited police brutality as the trigger for their flight from their homeland. Despite tighter restrictions imposed on East German travel abroad in the wake of the refugee flood, hundreds escape daily and make their way either to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s embassies in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> or to <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. More than 52,000 East Germans have flooded into <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> since Sept. 10, and another 70,000 more have been allowed to emigrate legally so far this year.

 <PERSON> Rockey </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> and a few of his buddies wanted to volunteer to pick up trash along a 3-mile stretch of road in their hometown. So <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> applied for his group to join the state's successful `` Adopt-A-Highway'' program, which credits volunteers with a sign bearing their name and is placed along the strech of road they spruced up. `` We were willing to pick up garbage a minimum of four times a year,'' he said. `` In return, they would erect me a green and white sign just like everyone else.'' That's the rub. <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> is the exalted cyclops of the <LOCATION> Rockingham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> chapter of the Invisible Empire of the <ORGANIZATION> Ku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION>. Last weekend, he and the other volunteers wore their white robes as they handed out leaflets in downtown <LOCATION> Reidsville </LOCATION>, a town of 12,400 near the <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> border. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tranportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON> denied the <ORGANIZATION> KKK </ORGANIZATION>'s request, saying it would be detrimental to the program, which has become the largest of its kind in the nation. `` They -LRB- transportation officials -RRB- were afraid it would lead to that part of the highway becoming more of a target of people dumping a lot of trash for them to pick up,'' said <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, who supports <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON>'s decision. Of the nearly 5,000 civic groups, businesses and neighborhoods that have volunteered to adopt more than 10,000 miles of state roads, only a handful had been turned down. One group was a rock band called the <ORGANIZATION> Sex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> and another was a lingerie store called the Bra Patch. The department said earlier this month the agency feared motorists would be offended by the words `` sex'' and `` bra'' on the road signs that identify the Adopt-A-Highway volunteers. But <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> says that `` never in my wildest dreams did I think they'd turn me down. I know enough about my constitutional rights to know when they're being stepped on.'' The <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> branch of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> agrees. `` We feel it is a violation of the Klan's First Amendment rights,'' said <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodges </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> board member, on Friday. `` Regardless of what they stand for, we should take on the case.'' State <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Shields </PERSON> said his organization would come to the aid of any group whose constitutional rights were being violated. `` If government is able to decide who gets to participate in a program based upon government approval of their views, government is doing a very Klan-like thing,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> will ask the state <ORGANIZATION> DOT </ORGANIZATION> to reconsider its decision. If that fails, <PERSON> Shields </PERSON> said, a lawsuit could be filed in state or federal court. <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>, a welder, does not consider it ironic that the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION>, usually thought of as a liberal organization, came to his group's assistance `` I did n't even ask them why they did it because I already knew the answer,'' he said. `` This is a First Amendment issue.'' Some <LOCATION> Reidsville </LOCATION> residents said they felt the Klansmen were entitled to join the program like anyone else. `` If they want to clean up the trash, let'em,'' said <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Wingfield </PERSON>, who was delivering phone books out of the back of her pickup truck. `` Fair is fair. Who cares who cleans it up? I certainly do n't want to do it.'' But <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunnally </PERSON>, the owner of a photography studio, was indignant about the Klan's efforts. `` They've got such a bad name,'' he said. `` People would save up their trash and throw it on their stretch of highway.'' <PERSON> Nunnally </PERSON>, who is black, said the county was not ready for the Klan to begin advertising itself like other civic organizations. `` They need to prove themselves for a few more years before they get into something like this,'' he said. The governor suggested the <ORGANIZATION> KKK </ORGANIZATION> was `` about as interested in creating a controversy over it ... as they are in cleaning it up.'' <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>, whose mobile home sports a <ORGANIZATION> Confederate </ORGANIZATION> flag in front, agreed in part, saying it's a chance to get some good publicity for his group and dispel `` a myth out there that we're still hate-mongers.'' `` We're a pro-white organization, just like the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> for the Advancement of Colored People -RRB- is pro-black.'' A youth group affiliated with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advancement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colored </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> has adopted a highway in <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> in eastern <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. `` This is n't a matter of black and white,'' <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> said. `` This is a matter of rights.''

 After eight years, final <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> hearings on the impeachment case against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Alcee </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> are tentatively set for this week, with a vote on whether to remove him from office possible by week's end. Removal from the bench would be a form of `` living death,'' said <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>, who was acquitted in a jury trial, but he's anxious to move ahead with his life. `` We are now talking in the ninth year of this matter,'' he said in an interview. `` Everyone should be entitled to closure by now. It's not in the best interests of <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> -LRB- and -RRB- it does not serve the community.'' He noted the busy <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> has been, in effect, one judge short. He stopped hearing criminal cases last year and has n't presided in a civil trial since early summer, when he was preparing for the inquiry by a special 12-member <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel. A vote by two-thirds of the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> would be needed to remove him from his $ 89,500-a-year job. He's ready to return to the bench `` with vigor,'' <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> said, or to begin a new job he refused to give any hints about. `` I have a plan to stay and a plan to go,'' said <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>, 52, appointed in 1979 by President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> as <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s first black federal judge. `` I believe everyone knows that the system will not cause me to roll over.'' His problems began Oct. 9, 1981, when his friend <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> A </PERSON>. Borders, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> attorney, was arrested in an undercover <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> operation of alleged fixing of court cases. Borders was convicted of bribery conspiracy, but <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> was acquitted in a separate 1983 jury trial. However, a subsequent investigation led to <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>' impeachment last year in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, which accused him of plotting to obtain a bribe, lying during his trial defense and an unrelated charge of disclosing federal wiretap information. <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> said he thinks he has `` a good shot'' of remaining on the bench. However, some senators expressed doubts about some of <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>' actions Among those: his showing up at a restaurant, as Borders had told an undercover agent <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> would do, to signify Borders' influence with him, and his efforts to avoid <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> the night of Borders' arrest <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> inquiry produced no `` smoking gun,'' no strong new evidence against him. `` In fairness to anybody who is a detractor of mine, you could say there is some persuasive evidence that one could infer that I was guilty. But persuasive evidence has to be conclusive before you pull that switch.'' <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> is the only federal official ever impeached after acquittal in a trial and his attorneys argued for years that he was being subjected to unconstitutional double jeopardy. `` You have to know that I'm the only person in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> this has happened to,'' he said. He continues to protest the use of a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel, instead of the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, to hear his case. The panel then sent a report to the other senators. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, which says it's free to handle its business as it sees fit, has in recent years used the panel system to keep other <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> business from being halted by impeachment cases. In recent months, <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> has made speeches in 10 states and dozens of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> cities, explaining his case and urging people to write their senators. <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, spokesman for Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., said <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>'s office has answered 1,400 letters, most in <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>' support `` It has been difficult,'' <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> said. `` But if it is next week or next month, when the dust settles, I will be standing tall with dignity.''

<TEXT>
 A jury rejected an insanity defense Sunday in the second phase of the trial of an 18-year-old already convicted of first-degree murder in the ax slayings of his parents and two siblings. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brom </PERSON>, a 16-year-old high school sophomore at the time of the deaths, knew what he was doing and knew it was wrong, the jury ruled in completing <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>'s two-part trial system for insanity pleas. `` Obviously we're very pleased with the verdict. We had anticipated that the law was in favor of this verdict,'' said prosecutor <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmitz </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Olmsted </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> attorney. He said he would urge the judge to give Brom the maximum sentence of 70 years in prison on each count. Brom, surrounded by sheriff's deputies, showed no emotion when the verdict was announced. One female juror appeared to be trying to keep from crying. Sentencing was set for Monday. If Judge <PERSON> Ancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Morse </PERSON> sentences Brom to consecutive sentences on the convictions, <LOCATION> Brom </LOCATION> will have no possibility of parole until the year 2059. However, if she judge orders sentences on the four murder counts to run concurrently, Brom would be eligible for parole in 17 years. Defense attorney <PERSON> Terrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> said he was not surprised by the verdict, but said that after 21 -LCB- hours of deliberation over three days, `` I felt I had a fighting chance.'' An appeal is automatic in first-degree murder convictions. <PERSON> Brom </PERSON> was described as a gentle boy who wrote poetry but also liked hard-core rock music with violent overtones. He had pleaded innocent by reason of mental illness in the February 1988 deaths at the family's rural <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION> home. The first phase of the trial, which began Sept. 18, ended Oct. 3 _ <ORGANIZATION> Brom </ORGANIZATION>'s 18th birthday _ with jurors finding <ORGANIZATION> Brom </ORGANIZATION> guilty of four counts of first-degree murder. In the second phase, the jury was asked to decide whether <PERSON> Brom </PERSON> was aware of what he was doing and knew it was wrong at the time of the murders. During the second phase of the trial, jurors heard often conflicting testimony from several psychiatrists concerning <ORGANIZATION> Brom </ORGANIZATION>'s sanity at the time of the killings All the psychiatrists agreed that <PERSON> Brom </PERSON> suffered from a major mental illness, but only one of five psychiatrists testified that <PERSON> Brom </PERSON> met <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>'s legal standard of insanity.

<HEAD>Darman Says Automatic Budget Cuts Would Be Good Medicine For Nation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The White House budget chief said Sunday it might be best if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> leaves in place automatic spending cuts that take effect Monday night rather than follow the past practice of rolling them back. The $ 16 billion cut, formally known as a sequestration, is automatic under the 1985 Gramm-Rudman Act that was designed to force the president and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to reduce the federal deficit. This year, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the administration failed to find a compromise. `` I think it may be that sequester is the best available alternative. At least it is real,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> and Budget. The automatic budget cuts of Gramm-Rudman took effect in 1986 and 1987 as well, but <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> acted quickly to restore the lost funds, a process that <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> called `` phony.'' `` This time, if it goes into effect, I think it would be good if people would live with it and say, ` do n't restore the cuts,''' <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> said on the <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION> program, `` This Week With <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkley </PERSON>.'' The chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, Rep. <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON>, D-Calif., said he thought <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> could agree on a formula similar to a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> package passed last Friday that met the Gramm-Rudman targets The failure to meet those targets, said <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON>, was linked to the sharp drop in stock prices Friday. `` I think there is a relationship because I think that for the last eight to 10 years, we've been essentially on a debt binge in this country,'' <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON> said on the <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION> program `` Meet the Press.'' The federal debt has reached $ 3.1 trillion, and corporate and personal debt also have soared, he said. `` In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> ... we've reached a point where we simply do n't have strong leadership to try to reduce the deficit and make tough choices,'' he said An author of the Gramm-Rudman law, Sen. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>, rebutted criticism by some members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that the bill had led the government to engage in deceptive accounting practices and had exacerbated the deficit. `` The bottom line is, under Gramm-Rudman, we've cut the deficit in half. We've cut the rate of growth in federal spending in half. And the federal government has gotten smaller relative to the private sector of the economy,'' he said. `` Has the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> cheated? And has the president, in the best spirit of bipartisanship, worked with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to cheat? The answer is yes,'' said <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>. `` But are we better off with Gramm-Rudman than we would be without it? I think the answer is, clearly, yes.''

<HEAD>Party To Purge Hostile Elements, Businessmen</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: LEADS thruout to UPDATE with party voting to purge hostile elements
and wealthy businessmen. No pickup.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Leaders in the <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> voted Sunday to purge the party of `` hostile and anti-party elements'' and wealthy private businessmen, whom they called exploiters. The decision, reported by the official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, indicated that the harsh crackdown triggered by student protests in June is not winding down after nearly five months, but rather will be intensified. Also Sunday, an official report said lawmakers have proposed banning <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> residents from anti-government activities after the colony reverts to Chinese rule in 1997. <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> said the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> party committee, which has led the nation in hard-line rhetoric, approved a resolution to `` purify the party organizations'' by requiring all members in the city to reregister during the coming year. Only those who meet party qualifications will be retained, it said. `` A drive will be conducted to examine and investigate how party members, especially officials with a party membership, behaved in ending the national turmoil and quelling the anti-government rioting,'' it said, referring to pro-democracy protests that the army crushed in June. `` The overwhelming majority of the party members will be united and educated and a very small number of hostile and anti-party elements will be resolutely purged from the party,'' it said. It did not say how many of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s 10 million residents are party members or how many are expected to survive the examination. So far, only a few expulsions from the party have been announced, including that of <PERSON> Yan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jiaqi </PERSON>, a political scientist who fled to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> in June and is working to organize an opposition from overseas. Former party General Secretary <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON>, ousted for allegedly supporting the student protests, has been allowed to keep his party membership, but some top officials are believed to be pressing for his expulsion. He already has lost all his party posts. Leading targets of the party purge include private businessmen, whom the resolution referred to as `` exploiters.'' `` The resolution stipulated that exploiters can not be admitted into the party, and those who have already been party members must adhere to the party's ideals,'' it said. `` Besides getting their own due pay, they should spend their post-tax profits on production and public welfare and should not use them for their own private needs. If they fail to do so, they can no longer be party members,'' it said. Private businessmen were commonly described as `` exploiters'' during the first three decades of Communist rule, but after senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> began reforming the centralized economy a decade ago, they were embraced as partners in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s modernization At least one millionaire has been admitted to the party. Since the June crackdown on the student movement, however, hard-line policies have made a comeback in all areas. The slogan of <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s early reforms, `` To get rich is glorious,'' has been dropped, and party leaders have begun criticizing private businessmen for becoming wealthy. Some cities have put limits on how much self-employed businessmen can pay themselves, and tax officials have been ordered to make sure private businessmen pay what they owe. Many private clothing sellers and bar owners in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> have said they want to sell their businesses. The resolution also said the party will examine officials at all levels and make any changes it considers necessary. `` Political integrity will be emphasized in choosing and appointing officials in the future,'' it said. The <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> party committee has heard a series of hard-line speeches in the past few days from its head, <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Ximing </PERSON>, including a call Thursday for direct party decision-making in universities and at the most local level of government. The <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> proposal, the latest in a series of statements by the government about its future rule there, was likely to add to fears that have caused tens of thousands of residents to flee the British colony. The legislators, members of the <ORGANIZATION> Standing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, also reiterated the government position that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> will have the right to station troops in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and declare a state of emergency there

 Thousands of tons of goods urgently needed to ease widespread shortages are sitting at rail stations and food shipments are rotting for lack of people and equipment to move the cargo, Soviet media reported Sunday. Strikes and sheer mismanagement were blamed for the transport jam, which has exacerbated shortages and threatened to derail perestroika, Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reform program. Premier <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> warned on national television Sunday night that `` if things do not improve shortly, we'll have to take tough measures against leaders of all ranks.'' More than 2 million tons of cargo are piled up in Soviet ports for lack of train transport, newspapers said. This includes thousands of containers of consumer goods and food purchased by the government on an emergency basis to appease a public angered by empty store shelves. <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> said the unloaded cargo included 25,000 tons of imported food and that some of it was spoiling. The news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported that 1,700 trains were stalled for lack of coal, even though the country's first nationwide coal strike ended two months ago. As of Wednesday, 100,000 railcars were out of circulation, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said, quoting Railroad Minister <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Konarev </PERSON>. In the critical harvest season, key rail depots are clogged with 180 cars of meat rotting in the <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> depots alone, media said. Incoming trains are waiting for unloading, and outgoing cargo is piled up for lack of empty containers and railcars. `` The work of the <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> rail center is effectively paralyzed,'' the daily <ORGANIZATION> Sovietskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rossiya </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday. `` All the approaches to stations for dozens of kilometers around the city, all the cargo yards and sorting stations are packed with unloaded freight cars.'' The <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> traffic jam began when Byelorussian farms began shipping potatoes faster than the city's vegetable warehouses could take them in, the paper said. Rail authorities finally managed to deal with the glut of potatoes, but now refrigerated cars, oil tankers, auto-transport wagons and flatbed cars for containers are backing up. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has long had difficulty transporting its harvest to storage and shops. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported this week that 29 million tons of grain, one million tons of meat and 25 percent of vegetables are lost each year between field and table. This year, the annual difficulties are exacerbated by strikes in the <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Moldavia </LOCATION> regions spawned by ethnic conflicts. Trains have not run for 18 days in <LOCATION> Moldavia </LOCATION> in a language dispute, said <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, quoting <PERSON> Valentin </PERSON> <PERSON> Tetenov </PERSON>, a legislator who heads the Supreme Soviet transportation committee. Rail traffic to <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, was halted from Sept. 5 to Sept. 17, and sporadically since then, in an economic blockade mounted by <PERSON> Azerbaijanis </PERSON> as part of the lengthy dispute over rights to the <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> enclave. Rail officials apparently continued to load trains and send them to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> even though they knew the line was closed, because at one point, 400 trains were reported stuck on the tracks to <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Smolensk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cargo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Depot </ORGANIZATION> was piled high with containers Sunday afternoon, including some shipped from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> nearly five weeks ago and one sent from <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> in June. The lone worker on the scene said factories were not sending trucks to pick up their shipments. `` Who knows why?'' he shrugged. In the <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> region, 300 containers are stacked in the rail depot, because so many trucks have broken down for lack of spare parts. The critical parts are somewhere in the mountain of cargo, the news program <ORGANIZATION> Vremya </ORGANIZATION> said Saturday. The <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION> has closed one sugar beet processing plant and may have to close 30 more at the height of the harvest because the warehouses are full and there are no railcars to haul the sugar, the labor newspaper Trud reported Sunday. Sugar is rationed in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, primarily because it is used for making moonshine. Trud quoted the head of the <ORGANIZATION> Ukrainian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unions </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sologub </PERSON>, as saying 280,000 tons of cargo has piled up at the port in <LOCATION> Odessa </LOCATION>, and factory workers are being drafted into stevedore duty.

<TEXT>
 An Iraqi politician Sunday was hounded from the podium by cries of `` war criminal'' at the first international conference in nearly 70 years on the Kurdish people, whose ancient <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> homeland straddles four countries. The two-day conference focused attention on human rights abuses suffered by the Kurds, an ethnic minority of about 20 million people spread across <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>. Held under the auspices of France-Liberty, a human rights foundation set up by First Lady <PERSON> Danielle </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, the conference drew 300 participants from 36 countries, including <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, and Lord <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Avebury </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliamentary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. `` Innocent women and children have suffered and been tortured,'' <PERSON> Yelena </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON>, wife of Soviet physicist and Nobel Peace Prize winner <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, said Saturday in remarks at the start of the conference. But, she added, `` if we conducted a poll in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, only one in 100 people would know of the problems of the people in <LOCATION> Kurdistan </LOCATION>.'' Conference organizers hoped the meeting would raise international awareness. They passed resolutions asking for a fact-finding mission to be sent from the West to examine human rights abuses in Kurdish areas. They also called on the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> to hold a special session to examine the Kurdish question. Among the worst abuses noted by conference participants was last year's chemical-weapons offensive launched by <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> against Kurdish strongholds in the northern part of the country. Thousands of people died, including many women and children, and up to 100,000 others fled to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, according to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Kurdish leaders accuse <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> of genocide and many of those at the conference threatened to walk out when <PERSON> Bahaddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmet </PERSON>, president of the Kurdish Parliament of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, tried to take the podium. Kurdish leaders in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> accused members of the <ORGANIZATION> Kurdish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, set up by the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> government in 1974, of being collaborators. `` A war criminal is speaking here!'' cried <PERSON> Jalal </PERSON> <PERSON> Talabani </PERSON>, leader of the resistance group, <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kurdistan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iraq </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Talabani </PERSON> seized the podium and the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> delegation withdrew. The resistance group accuses <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> of destroying nearly 4,000 Kurdish villages and relocating 220,000 Kurdish families to other parts of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> during a 15-year effort to `` Arabize'' oil-rich parts of the country. The situation in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, Kurdish spokesmen say, is the most dramatic example of the plight of the Kurds. Descended from the ancient Medes who occupied the area that is now <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, most Kurds are Sunni Moslems who speak their own language. The 200,000 square miles they occupy and call <LOCATION> Kurdistan </LOCATION> has, over the centuries, been ruled by <PERSON> Arabs </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Mongols </ORGANIZATION>, and Turks of the Ottoman Empire. When the Ottoman Empire was defeated at the end of World War I, the Allied Powers dismembered it and granted the Kurds autonomy under the 1920 Treaty of Sevres. The portion of the treaty giving autonomy to the group was never carried out and Kurdish nationalist aspirations were subjugated by colonial interests. About 10 million Kurds live in <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, 5.5 million in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, 3.5 million in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and about a million in <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>. Kurds number 650,000 in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, 320,000 in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and 100,000 in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. About 3,000 live in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

 An attempt to quietly remove a nearly century-old stone monument honoring white supremacists has sparked racial tensions and threatens federal funds for a construction project, officials said. City officials said the 20-foot obelisk must be removed because of road construction and because of commercial development of the area near the monument. `` They're lying in their teeth,'' said <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponthieux </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Boh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Construction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, foreman of the crew doing the street work `` I can work all around that monument. That monument does not have to be touched.'' None of the street work comes closer than 15 feet, he said. Streets Director <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Everett </PERSON>, who said that the move was forced by road work, said later last week that electrical and traffic engineers told her the obelisk might be damaged by the work. The monument also could block the view of traffic signals that will be installed after the road work is done, she said. `` It would be a safety hazard in the way that we have redesigned the intersection,'' said <PERSON> Everett </PERSON>. `` When uses change over the years, you have to make decisions for the safety of the public, both pedestrians and drivers.'' Erected in 1891, the monument bears the names of 16 people, all members of the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, who died in a brief, bloody battle in 1874 between the white supremacist group and the Reconstruction government. An inscription added in 1932 says, `` <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> troops took over the state government and reinstated the usurpers but the national election in November 1876 recognized white supremacy and gave us our state.'' It's the second time in eight years that an official in this predominantly black city has tried to remove the pointed pillar officially called the Liberty Place Monument. <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> said she gave the order to remove the monument without consulting Mayor <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Barthelemy </PERSON>, who is running for re-election in February 1990. <PERSON> Barthelemy </PERSON> has not publicly commented on the situation. While the road work continues, the order to remove the obelisk was put on hold until officials decide where it should go and whether moving it would violate federal law. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Montecino </PERSON>, an aide to lawmaker and former <PERSON> Ku </PERSON> <PERSON> Klux </PERSON> <PERSON> Klan </PERSON> leader <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>, said moving the obelisk could mean the construction project will lose federal funds since it could be a candidate for the National Register of Historic Places. Although the monument is n't yet on the National Register, federal rules require preservation officials be consulted before work starts at a site that might qualify for the register, said <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tassin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s historic preservation officer. In the 1970s, blacks demanded removal of the monument, which had long been and continues to be a rallying point for white supremacists. Their demands were rejected, but a plaque repudiating the references to white supremacy was added in 1974. Former Mayor <PERSON> Dutch </PERSON> <PERSON> Morial </PERSON>, the city's first black mayor, advertised in 1981 for a firm to remove the monument from the center of a tiny traffic circle. The <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> said the obelisk had to stay, but agreed to let the 1932 inscriptions be removed. They were filled in, whitewashed over, and covered up. But the covers since have been removed, leaving bolts sticking out from partly erased inscriptions. The 1974 plaque also is nowhere to be seen. <PERSON> Morial </PERSON>'s move, like <PERSON> Everett </PERSON>'s order, sparked challenges from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> for the Advancement of White People, founded by <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>. <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>, former imperial wizard of the Knights of the <ORGANIZATION> Ku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION>, founded the <ORGANIZATION> NAAWP </ORGANIZATION> after repudiating the Klan. He was elected last February to the state <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> NAAWP </ORGANIZATION> held a small protest at the monument Saturday in which about 20 people showed up. The group said it would be satisfied if the city assured it the monument would be erected somewhere within the 10 blocks covered by the <ORGANIZATION> Battle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberty </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> NAAWP </ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON> Callie </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Pry </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 A team of federal inspectors arrived Sunday to investigate a fire that gutted much of a parked <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 and burned a gaping hole in its fuselage. Five crew members and one passenger were treated for smoke inhalation and released after Saturday's fire at a boarding gate at <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. The investigation, assisted by representatives of <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>, should take three or four days, said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, regional director for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. He said early indications were that the fire broke out in an area of the belly of the fuselage, below and behind the cockpit, where the plane's computer and aviation electronics are housed. The top of the plane's forward fuselage was scarred by a gaping black hole roughly 4 feet wide and 15 feet long that appeared to nearly sever the front third of the plane. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> officials praised the crew of Flight 1558 for their cool, quick evacuation of the plane and the firefighters who surrounded the aircraft within minutes of the first alarm. Nine passengers and six crew members were on board when smoke, following a loud pop, began billowing from a vent in the first-class section. `` We're all fortunate with how the circumstances came about,'' <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Rollins </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>'s district director of marketing, said Sunday. `` The crew was there and ready, they acted very rapidly. They were very, very efficient. ... There was no panic, no pushing or screaming or anything.'' The plane, just in from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, had been scheduled to depart <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Edmonton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alberta </LOCATION>, with 86 passengers. Passengers were put on another <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> flight to <LOCATION> Edmonton </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said the airport's fire units responded with `` exceptional'' speed. He credited a ground-crew member and the airport control tower for rushing firefighters to the scene. `` My understanding is that there was a mechanic on the outside of the airplane, and he first observed the fire and he was equipped with a radio, so he was able to assist in the initial notification quickly,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. Control tower personnel noticed the smoke about the same time, he added. Firefighters extinguished the flames within 15 minutes, authorities said. While the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> team triesto nail down the cause of the fire, <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> officials will determine whether the $ 30 million airplane can eventually be returned to service. `` It's too early to determine if it's reparable. That depends on the analysis by structural engineers and further investigation,'' <PERSON> Rollins </PERSON> said. He had no dollar estimate for damages. <PERSON> Rollins </PERSON> said he did not know the plane's age, but <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>'s fleet has an average age of 8.4 years.

 An ammonia leak at a pizza plant prompted the all-night evacuation of this entire town of 6,500 people and left four people hospitalized Sunday, authorities said. An evacuation order was lifted shortly after 5:00 a.m. Sunday morning, said <LOCATION> Wellston </LOCATION> Assistant Fire Chief <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON>. `` We had some fog that moved in last night _ it was keeping the ammonia smell around parts of town,'' <PERSON> Long </PERSON> said. `` The sun dried it up.'' Deadly anhydrous ammonia used for refrigeration at the <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Jenno </PERSON>'s plant began leaking about 8 p.m. Saturday when a compressor cap blew off a 16-inch pipe inside the plant, said Mayor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Carey </PERSON> The evacuation of the town was ordered at 10:30 p.m. and the leak was contained by 11 p.m.. About 50 people were taken to area hospitals Saturday night and early Sunday Most were given oxygen treatments and released, said <LOCATION> Vinton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Deputy Sheriff <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> on Sunday. Dozens of other residents were given oxygen treatment by emergency medical units and paramedics Saturday night. `` They all wanted to know if their lungs were going to blow up,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. `` They slept everywhere last night, in their cars, they were all over the place.'' <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dalton </PERSON>, spill unit supervisor of the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> and plant officials did not immediately know how much ammonia escaped or how much was in the system. `` Once the plant has made the repairs, then they'll recharge and determine how much they lost,'' <PERSON> Dalton </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Wellston </LOCATION> policeman <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bates </PERSON>, 26, and <PERSON> Jeno </PERSON>'s employee <PERSON> Evelyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilliland </PERSON>, 39, were in fair condition at <ORGANIZATION> Holtzer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, said a nursing supervisor who did not give her name. <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>, 27, and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>, 36, were also in fair condition at <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Community </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, said nursing supervisor <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> McFann </PERSON>. Elderly people and nursing home residents were advised not to return until later Sunday morning to give the cloud time to dissipate completely, <PERSON> Long </PERSON> said. Residents of the town's two nursing homes, <LOCATION> Edgewood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Manor </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Jenkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, were returned to the homes by about 9 a.m. Sunday, he said. Evacuees were taken by school bus to two schools in the nearby towns of <LOCATION> Hamden </LOCATION> and <PERSON> McArthur </PERSON> and to a community center in <LOCATION> McArthur </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Ethel </PERSON> <PERSON> Gussler </PERSON>, a dispatcher at the <LOCATION> Vinton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's department Police and sheriff's deputies said no looting was reported following the evacuation. Employees from <PERSON> Jeno </PERSON>'s sanitation division returned to work early Sunday, <PERSON> Dalton </PERSON> said. The plant manufactures frozen pizzas. Environmental damage from the leak appeared to be minimal, he said. Inspectors had feared that the ammonia would dissolve into water in streams, storm drains and sanitary sewers. <PERSON> Dalton </PERSON> said ammonia can kill fish and the bacteria used at sewage treatment plants to break down raw sewage. Runoff from the plant was contained in a diversion ditch around the plant and did not reach streams, he said. `` Anhydrous ammonia reacts with liquid in your lungs, changes form, then attacks tissues. It can directly suffocate you,'' <PERSON> Dalton </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Wellston </LOCATION> is about 90 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>.

 Underground leaders of the Arab uprising on Sunday rejected a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plan to arrange talks between Israelis and Palestinians, and Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> opposed the idea of holding such talks in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said he preferred lower-level talks than those proposed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and that they should be held in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Security forces killed a Palestinian and wounded three others during protests in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said a Palestinian accused of collaborating with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was killed by masked activists. The latest deaths brought to 595 the number of Palestinians killed by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers and civilians during the 22-month-old uprising; another 130 Palestinians have been killed by fellow Arabs as suspected collaborators. Forty Israelis also have died in the violence. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plan formulated by Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> is designed to bring about a meeting in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> urged by <LOCATION> Egyptian </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> as a way to bridge differences between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. The underground <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> leadership, in its 47th leaflet since the start of the rebellion in December 1987, said it `` rejects <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s suspicious role, primarily <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s five points.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s plan calls for consultations between the Israeli and Egyptian foreign ministers to agree on the makeup of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> delegation for the proposed <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> meeting. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> urged the meeting as a way to revive <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s stalled peace initiative, which calls for elections among Palestinians in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> to pick delegates to negotiate with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on interim self-rule. The leaflet from the uprising's PLO-backed leadership said <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s ideas merely supported <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s election plan and were a way to avoid the international peace conference that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> wants. The uprising leaders already have rejected the <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> plan. In an interview with the independent daily <ORGANIZATION> Maariv </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said he saw no reason to meet in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>. `` Why go to <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>, when the two sides, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION>, are here?'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> asked. He said the meeting should be in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and that it should merely be a gathering of technocrats to iron out details of his election plan. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON> later said the prime minister did not mean that such talks could only be held in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> but was `` just raising different possibilites.'' But he said <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> does wants to lower the profile of the contacts. `` You can not conduct high-level meetings in the limelight because it is difficult to get results,'' <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON> said. Also Sunday, a military court sentenced a reserve soldier to two years in prison for causing the death of two Palestinians in May 1988, the army said. Army raido said <PERSON> Ilan </PERSON> <PERSON> Orev </PERSON>, 25, was chasing stone-throwers in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <PERSON> Bani </PERSON> <PERSON> Naim </PERSON> when he knelt, took aim and fired two bullets into the heads of two rioters, in violation of orders not to open fire. Late Sunday, 3-year-old <PERSON> Attiyah </PERSON> el-Ghurani of the Shati refugee camp died of a gunshot injury he suffered on Thursday, the army said. Officials at <LOCATION> Shifa </LOCATION> hospital in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> said the boy's skull had been shattered by a rubber-coated metal pellet fired by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers. The army said at the time that its troops had not opened fire in the area but that it was checking further. An army spokesman said Sunday that no new details were available.

 Tens of thousands of abortion-rights supporters, buoyed by recent legal and political victories, marched through downtown <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> to a rally in front of City Hall on Sunday. Across the continent in <LOCATION> Trenton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, several thousand demonstrators chanted, waved banners and marched on the Statehouse to tell lawmakers not to tamper with their right to a safe and legal abortion. The <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> marchers, about three-fourths of them women, carried signs proclaiming the right to choose abortion and, in some cases, denouncing President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for his anti-abortion stand. `` A lot of the younger generation felt the right was safe, but now it's threatened,'' said <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON>, 70, of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, who wore a `` Retain Choice!'' sign on her back. `` I think the politicians will be hearing it.'' Police estimated the crowd at 30,000. March coordinator <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Braverman </PERSON> said the turnout was 45,000 to 60,000. No anti-abortion demonstrators were seen along the route. After parading past friendly onlookers along more than a mile of Market Street, the city's main boulevard, marchers gathered in front of City Hall for a rally and speeches by politicians. Some of the loudest cheers were for <PERSON> Norma </PERSON> <PERSON> McCorvey </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> woman who was `` <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Roe </PERSON>'' in the 1973 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling legalizing abortion. The march, organized by <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chapter </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Bay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pro-Choice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION>, came on the heels of several developments favorable to the abortion-rights cause around the nation. Last week <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, for the first time since 1981, voted to fund Medicaid abortions for poor women in cases of rape and incest, despite a veto threat by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Earlier in the week the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> rejected attempts by Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> to tighten restrictions on abortion. The <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> and a <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeal </ORGANIZATION> have blocked enforcement this month of state laws that would require parental consent for minors' abortions. And Democratic candidates for governor in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> have used their abortion-rights stands to gain on their <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> opponents, according to opinion polls. Also on Sunday, <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Madeleine </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunin </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> unveiled an unusual plea to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> from 10 governors urging the justices to reject efforts to restrict abortions. A number of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> marchers said a recent <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling giving states more authority to restrict abortion had galvanized pro-choice sentiment. `` People did n't think their right to choose was threatened. Now, with the Webster -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- ruling, they're aware of the threat,'' said <PERSON> Lita </PERSON> <PERSON> Krowech </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION>, whose T-shirt read, `` <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Out of My Uterus.'' Several signs called for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> approval of RU-486, the French abortion-inducing pill. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> gathering Sunday drew about 6,500, state police estimated. Rally organizers said 10,000 people participated. Demonstrators filled the street in front of the Statehouse and drew national women's rights leaders, who said the nation is watching the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> governor's race. They told the crowd that lawmakers will begin chipping away at abortion rights unless pro-choice voices are heard in every state. `` You will set the standard for the 1990s. You will prove to candidates across the country _ if you're out of touch, you could be out of office,'' said <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> Michelman </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abortion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>. Anti-abortion forces staged a small demonstration about a block away. On Saturday, 116 people were arrested in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and 69 in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> during anti-abortion demonstrations outside clinics.

 Relatives of <PERSON> Raoul </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallenberg </PERSON> planned to meet Monday with Soviet officials in hopes of learning the fate of the Swede who saved tens of thousands of Hungarian Jews from Nazi extermination, then vanished after Soviet troops arrested him in 1945. <PERSON> Wallenberg </PERSON>'s half-sister <PERSON> Nina </PERSON> <PERSON> Lagergren </PERSON> and half-brother <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Dardel </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Sunday.

Playing and practicing the clarinet is something of an obsession, he says. `` There have been times when I would film all day long and would n't get to my hotel room until 10:30 at night,'' <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said. `` So I would get into bed and pull the quilt up over my head so I would n't offend the neighbors.'' <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> missed the 1978 Academy Awards in which he won an Oscar for the movie `` Annie Hall'' so he could make his weekly gig.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, a barrier coast off the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> coast, was struck by the deadliest hurricane on record in September 1900. The powerful storm sent a wall of water washing over the island, and some called it the worst natural disaster in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history. The death toll from that storm is n't certain, but experts generally agree it easily topped 6,000. Some accounts placed the number of people killed at 8,000. The storm caused damage estimated at $ 30 million and $ 40 million. Fifteen years later, in August, another hurricane hit <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION>. The official death toll was estimated at 275, much lower than the great 1900 storm. That's because storm-wary residents had raised the grade of the island and built a seawall to protect them from surging tides blamed for most of the deaths. Still, damage from the 1915 storm was set at $ 50 million.

 During this season of the <ORGANIZATION> Martha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Graham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>, short dances by some of the company members are being shown. Even on those programs, most of the evening has dances created by <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, who is 95. The more interesting of the `` <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> and ... New Choreographers'' programs this past week at the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> had <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Rooks </PERSON> dancing his own solo, a love duet choreographed by <PERSON> Jacqulyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Buglisi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Maxine </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> doing her own abstract solo. <PERSON> Rooks </PERSON>' solo, `` Outside,'' has a text from the gospel of <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> printed in the program so the audience knew what he was driving at. <PERSON> Rooks </PERSON> also conveyed it clearly in his dance. There was not only weeping and gnashing of teeth but fear, flight _ which he managed to suggest by flinging himself in circles instead of running, supplication as humble as a dog's begging and despair. It was a tour de force. <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Herring </PERSON> and <PERSON> Donlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON> danced `` Sospiri,'' which was totally a beautiful love duet. It included, at different times, a spiritual sense and graphic embraces. Program notes for <PERSON> Maxine </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON>'s `` Watermark'' say that the mystery and virtue of fidelity will unfold. Miss <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> was more abstract than that. Her green chiffon and long hair unfolded but we received no message. In the earlier program, <PERSON> Thea </PERSON> <PERSON> Nerissa </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> danced excerpts from her own `` Portrait.'' This was inspired by her grandmother. A rather well-known solo, `` Cry,'' dedicated `` to all our mothers everywhere,'' performed at the <PERSON> Alvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ailey </PERSON> American Dance Theater, is similar and more telling, which detracted a bit from the impact of `` Portrait.'' <PERSON> Camille </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> and <PERSON> Young-Ha </PERSON> <PERSON> Yoo </PERSON> danced <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Branaugh </PERSON>'s `` Dissonant Conversation. It's interesting but looks the most closely patterned on <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> movement style, as backs arch and necks bend and hold, like sculpture. The woman pushes the man a couple of times. She approaches him from the side, as his arm is extended so that his arm is around her. At the end, they've traded the still positions in which they began. Each program ended with an important <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> work, `` Cortege of Eagles'' from 1967 and `` The Rite of Spring'' from 1984.

 Thousands of people braved wilting heat Sunday to see <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> laid `` temporarily to rest'' in a service that was part religious ceremony and part political rally. <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON>, the last <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Chief Justice during <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' rule, collapsed during an emotional speech by the ousted <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> president's son, <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> or `` Bong Bong.'' Dr. <PERSON> Azucena </PERSON> <PERSON> Ignacio </PERSON>, <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' personal physician, rushed from the raised platform holding <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' coffin and attended to <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> before an ambulance whisked him to <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. He was listed in stable condition. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> died at the same hospital Sept. 28 at age 72 after a long illness. Initial ambulance reports said the 74-year-old <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON>, who reportedly has a slight heart ailment, had succumbed to the heat, exacerbated by the crush of people. The temperature at the cemetery was about 83 degrees with 72 percent humidity, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. More than 2,500 people waited hours for <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' widow, <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON>, to arrive at the Valley of the Temples Memorial Park with her husband's body. The funeral procession began shortly after 11:15 a.m. when more than a dozen men rolled <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' casket up a long, winding hillside drive, with hundreds of mourners walking behind. They were preceded by supporters carrying the presidential seal of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> flags. When the pallbearers reached the stairs leading to the small air-conditioned mausoleum, which had the initials FM landscaped into shrubs below, elderly retired <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> generals were replaced by younger men. Once up the stairs, the closed coffin, covered with a Philippine flag, was surrounded by white flowers on a porch overlooking the mourners below. Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, dressed all in black, was joined on the platform by her son, daughter, <PERSON> Irene </PERSON> <PERSON> Araneta </PERSON>, and adopted daughter, <PERSON> Aimee </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. There were prayers and a blessing by Monsignor <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON> <PERSON> Nebres </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> priest who drew the wrath of the <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> Catholic Diocese for comparing <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> during a funeral Mass Friday. Ms. <PERSON> Araneta </PERSON> sang her father's favorite long song and Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> sang `` Ave Maria'' and the Lord's Prayer. Eleven-year-old <PERSON> Aimee </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> read a saying `` Daddy, I will always love you forever. Thank you for your legacy of love.'' The service took a more political turn after pop star <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON> <PERSON> Papin </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' partner in a recent commercial recording duet, sang a rousing rendition of the Philippine national anthem, with many in the crowd singing along. <PERSON> Bong-Bong </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, widely reported to have political aspirations himself, stirred the crowd with a eulogy to his father, whom he called `` a man of unbridled excellence.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> has vowed to eventually bury her husband in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and said entombing him above ground in the mausoleum would make it easier to return his remains to his homeland. Philippine President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, who replaced <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> after a 1986 popular revolt ended his 20-year dictatorial rule and sent him into exile here, has prohibited <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' return even in death. The Marcoses were subsequently indicted on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> criminal racketeering charges accusing of them of looting their homeland's treasury

 `` Presleynost'' reached <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> shores Sunday when a Soviet Elvis fan stepped off an airplane in blue suede shoes, clutching an exit visa issued solely for a visit to Graceland, the home of his hero. <PERSON> Kolya </PERSON> <PERSON> Vasin </PERSON>, 44, an artist, sculptor and rock impresario from <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>, arrived in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> Sunday night. He was greeted by about 100 people, mostly members of area <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> fan clubs. `` I an admirer of Elvis from <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>. I am ambassador of Russian rock' n' roll. I love rock' n' roll many, many years,'' he said. `` I am happy to be here today.'' <PERSON> Vasin </PERSON> said he's been an Elvis fan since hearing a bootleg copy of `` Jailhouse Rock.'' Visiting Graceland will be the culmination of a 30-year dream, he said during a layover in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. `` I listen to ` Jailhouse Rock' for the first time in 1958. After this shocking moment, I love <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> forever,'' said the long-haired, bearded <PERSON> Vasin </PERSON>, who wore bluejeans, a black Elvis T-shirt, a yellow scarf and a black jacket. Earlier Sunday, <PERSON> Vasin </PERSON> arrived at <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> with 79 <ORGANIZATION> Elvis </ORGANIZATION> fans from <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. He spent a week in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> after leaving Oct. 7. on his first trip outside the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> <PERSON> Vasin </PERSON> said his obsession with <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> is simple. `` Because his voice, his spirit is God to me,'' he said. `` All the good feelings of the human race come out of <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON>.'' He pointed to his shoes and said: `` I got the shoes in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. This is my dream on my feet. All my life I hear ` Blue Suede Shoes' and I dream about them. <PERSON> Vasin </PERSON>'s visit, called `` Presleynost'' in honor of `` glasnost,'' or the policy of openness promulgated by Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, is being sponsored by <ORGANIZATION> Elvisly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yours </ORGANIZATION>, a London-based <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> fan club with a mailing list of 60,000, said club president <PERSON> Sid </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>. <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> fans raised the $ 3,500 for <PERSON> Vasin </PERSON>'s trip, he said. Every year, Elvisly Yours pays for several handicapped children to accompany the group on a trip to <LOCATION> Graceland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>, who has been to Graceland 36 times, said he decided to find a Soviet fan to sponsor. In his quest, he found an expert on rock' n' roll music in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> who told him that <PERSON> Vasin </PERSON> was the biggest <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> fan in the country. `` He's the Colonel <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' proclaimed <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>. `` He's a living legend in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> was Presley's longtime manager. <PERSON> Vasin </PERSON> said he had tried to get an exit visa for a year with no luck. But when he was approached by <PERSON> Elvisly </PERSON> <PERSON> Yours </PERSON>, his luck changed. The club arrranged for an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elvis </ORGANIZATION> club, Suspicious Minds, to extend an invitation to <PERSON> Vasin </PERSON> through Soviet authorities. As a result, he was finally granted a visa. During his 10-day visit in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Vasin </PERSON> plans to visit <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON>' first recording label in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON>' birthplace in <LOCATION> Tupelo </LOCATION>, Miss. <PERSON> Vasin </PERSON> said he arranges about five rock concerts a year in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. He said he paints, writes poetry and sculpts, but his major interest is rock _ and <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON>. `` All I want is to love rock and roll,'' said <PERSON> Vasin </PERSON>, who carried with him a charcoal drawing he did of <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON>. `` I sit in my very small room and listen to rock' n' roll with my friends and drink vodka.'' About his musical tastes, he said, `` Number one is <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON>, number two the Beatles, there is zero for the next numbers and then number eight is Little <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> and number nine is the Rolling Stones and number 10 <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Vasin </PERSON> said he bought all his Elvis records on the black market. The first Elvis record was sold legally this year, he said. During his stopover in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Vasin </PERSON> broke into a lusty rendition of <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Berry </PERSON>'s `` Memphis,'' singing, ` Long distance information, get me <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>.''

 Japanese investors Monday were visibly calmer about the stock market than they were after Black Monday two years ago. A retail brokerage office of the giant <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in the central <LOCATION> Ginza </LOCATION> district was somewhat busier than a usual Monday morning, but the market players seemed to be waiting for bargains rather than unloading their shares in a panic. `` I expect the Nikkei index to remain bearish all day, but I am not so worried because we all know it is due to external factors,'' said an investor watching the key index shortly after the market opening. `` I am going to sit and wait for a while and start buying shares later on as shares start hitting the bottom,'' he said. In October 1987, after a plunge on Wall Street that went down in history as Black Monday, brokerages in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> were packed with massive sell orders that led to the Black Tuesday here. The Nikkei average fell 3,836 points, or about 15 percent, on Oct. 20, 1987, following a 23 percent plunge on Wall Street, largely due to panic selling by private investors. `` Japanese private investors seemed to have learned the lesson that fluctuation of the Wall Street index is only one of many aspects of the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> market,'' said a dealer at <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` It is undoubtedly an important elmement, but not necessarily as dominant as it was thought to be.'' <PERSON> Keiishi </PERSON> <PERSON> Nishida </PERSON>, a dealer at the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> office of <ORGANIZATION> Kidder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said: `` This is nothing like the crash two years ago when private investors rushed to the brokers from early in the morning and sold all they had. I do n't think any investors expect <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> shares to drop like <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> this time.'' But he added that investors remained hesitant to place buy orders because `` they want to make sure that the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> plunge was only a one-time thing, and the <PERSON> Dow </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> will not go down further Monday there.'' <PERSON> Nishida </PERSON> also attributed <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>'s moderate recovery in late morning to programmed trading. `` After the sizable drop, buy orders from institutional investors on program-trading came in,'' he said. `` But other than that, I do n't expect much of buy orders today.'' Another investor in the <LOCATION> Ginza </LOCATION> office commented: `` In a trading day like today, you must deal with caution.''

 Bankers at their annual convention said Sunday the Friday the 13th stock plunge may be a blessing in disguise if it instills a new sense of caution about highly leveraged corporate buyouts. `` I do n't think it's going to be any disaster. It's just going to cause people to become more cautious as they should have been from the beginning,'' said <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Senterfitt </PERSON>, vice chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>. It was a snag in bank financing for an employee buyout of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> that triggered the stock market drop. Worry among traders that banks had become more wary of buyouts caused stocks of companies targeted for takeover to tumble and the weakness spread generally through the market. In the last 90 minutes of trading, the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average plummeted 190 points in the worst drop since the October 1987 crash. But <PERSON> Senterfitt </PERSON> and other bankers attending cocktail receptions and seminars at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the industry's largest trade group, were making no apologies Sunday `` What we were seeing was a house of cards, bound to come tumbling down. I hope the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> thing marks a more conservative approach by banking throughout,'' <PERSON> Senterfitt </PERSON> said. In a leveraged buyout, or LBO, investors _ often managers seeking to thwart a hostile takeover _ borrow heavily in order to take over a company or a division of a company. The new owners either cut costs or sell off parts of the company to pay back the loans. The danger is that the restructured company's debt burden is so heavy it will topple into bankruptcy in an economic downturn. Large banks, as profits in their traditional business of commercial lending grew scarce, have turned increasingly to leveraged buyout financing as a source of lucrative fees. In fact, according to analysts, some large banks are as heavily involved in LBO lending as they are in Third World debt. If all of the LBO lending went sour at once, a number of large banks would be insolvent. As of June 30, according to <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Litan </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Brookings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>, five large banks had made leveraged loans exceeding their equity: <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION>, 103 percent; <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>, 127 percent; <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, 123 percent; <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION>, 107 percent, and <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> <PERSON> Fargo </PERSON>, 119 percent. `` Aggregate LBO exposures, including related equity investments, exceed equity for most money-center banks,'' analyst <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> McDermott </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <PERSON> Keefe </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruyette </PERSON> and <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> warned the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> earlier this month. Regulators have noted the trend. Both the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>, which oversees bank holding companies, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, an arm of the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> which regulates nationally-chartered banks, formally warned banks last fall to exercise caution in LBOs and ordered government examiners to closely scrutinize such lending. That's starting to have an effect, according to <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rideout </PERSON>, outgoing <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> president and vice chairman of <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> `` It appears to me that regulators have a very good handle on the bank exposure to LBOs. ... That kind of publicity would make a credit committee more cautious,'' he said. <PERSON> Rideout </PERSON> said it's only natural that banks, with signs of a softening economy emerging, would apply tougher lending standards. `` When you've had an expansion as long as this one, you always think as a banker or businessman, ` When am I going to have to tighten my belt and hunker down a bit,'' he said. `` This would be the wrong time to invest in an airline, or any other industry, if you think you have doubts about their bottom line.'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dugger </PERSON>, the banking association's chief economist, said to a degree it is the buyout deals themselves that have changed, not bankers' attitudes. `` What you saw in the events of last week was a transaction that just did n't meet the flinch test. It required more faith in the future than bankers are accustomed to affording,'' he said. `` It does n't mean bankers have become more conservative. It reflects the fact that the leveraging in these deals has had to get progressively deeper in order to remain profitable,'' <PERSON> Dugger </PERSON> said. Banking analyst <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheshunoff </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, who was attending the convention, said, `` I think -LRB- the stock drop -RRB- is a healthy end to a phenomena that longer term could be detrimental to both the companies involved, the economy and the country. ... `` I think it's important that the LBO thing is slowing down now rather than reaching the proportions that it could have.''

<HEAD>Mexican Glass Giant Buys Anchor, Latchford Glass Companies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The huge Mexican glass company <ORGANIZATION> Vitro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION> announced Sunday it had signed a definitive agreement to buy <ORGANIZATION> Anchor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Class </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Container </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Latchford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Glass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> for more than $ 900 million. The Anchor deal, valued at about $ 800 million, would be the largest <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> takeover of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> company, <PERSON> Vitro </PERSON> said. Vitro's protracted effort to take over Tampa-based Anchor, the nation's second-largest glass company, won approval by <ORGANIZATION> Anchor </ORGANIZATION>'s directors after the glass giant raised its cash tender offer for Anchor stock from $ 20 to $ 21.25 a share Anchor's board of directors in August rejected the $ 20-a-share bid. `` The acquisition of Anchor, which has nearly $ 1 billion in sales, is a unique strategic opportunity for <ORGANIZATION> Vitro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION> to become a world player in the glass container industry,'' said <PERSON> Ernesto </PERSON> <PERSON> Martens </PERSON>, Vitro's chief executive officer. The tender offer and withdrawal rights are scheduled to expire at midnight EST Oct. 27, <PERSON> Vitro </PERSON> said in a statement Sunday. Vitro already owns about 10.3 percent of Anchor's shares. Vitro earlier announced a friendly merger agreement with <PERSON> Latchford </PERSON>, a small, privately owned glass maker based in <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. The Latchford deal was contingent upon the completion of the takeover of Anchor, <PERSON> Vitro </PERSON> said. Vitro, based in <LOCATION> Monterrey </LOCATION>, is one of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s largest publicly held companies, with more than 37,000 employees and a profit of $ 150 million in 1988 on revenues of almost $ 1.1 billion. Vitro manufactures glass and plastic containers, flat glass, major appliances, tableware and glassmaking machinery, and operates joint ventures with such <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corporations as <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Whirlpool </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ingersoll-Rand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Owens-Corning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fiberglass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Samsonite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Anchor Glass made $ 978 million last year manufacturing glass containers for food, beverage, and cosmetics industries in 20 factories across the country <PERSON> Latchford </PERSON>, which has two plants, has been making glass containers for food and beverage industries since 1917. Vitro promised Sunday to keep Anchor's corporate headquarters in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, and to run the company with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> managers as a fully independent <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> subsidiary. `` We are confident that the combination of our companies will result in enhanced business and financial prospects for Anchor's employees, customers and communities,'' <PERSON> Martens </PERSON> said Anchor's chairman and chief executive officer, <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Naimoli </PERSON>, also predicted a `` sound and exciting future for the employees of Anchor Glass.'' Vitro has said it plans to modernize Anchor's plants so that its products are more competitive with the plastic and aluminum containers that have taken an increasing share of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market for food containers. <ORGANIZATION> Lazard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freres </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Donaldson </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lufkin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jenrette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> are managing the tender offer for a Vitro subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION> THR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> is advising Anchor <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> has committed to provide $ 139 million of financing for the Anchor tender offer. An affiliate of <ORGANIZATION> Donaldson </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lufkin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jenrette </ORGANIZATION> has promised to provide a $ 155 million short-term loan for the separate buyout of <LOCATION> Latchford </LOCATION>, which was expected to close at the same time as the Anchor offer.

<TEXT>
 Union workers at <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s helicopter division on Sunday approved an indefinite contract extension at their <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> plant, avoiding a strike that has hit <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> plants elsewhere. No negotiations were scheduled in the nearly 2-week-old strike by machinists, but contract talks were set to begin Monday between <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> and its second-largest union, representing engineers and technical workers. Members of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Local </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 1069 </ORGANIZATION>, which represents about 3,200 hourly production and maintenance workers at <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Helicopters </ORGANIZATION>' suburban <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> plant, met Sunday after a 10-day contract extension expired at midnight. Company spokesman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Torgerson </PERSON> said the workers agreed to another extension, with a 10-day notification requirement to cancel for either side. `` We're just continuing to talk,'' <PERSON> Torgerson </PERSON> said. `` The major issues are wages and benefits.'' Neither Local 1069 president <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Forte </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>, chairman of the Local 1069 strike committee, were available Sunday to comment, according to a person answering the union's telephone. Neither side has released details in the contract dispute. The contract at the helicopter plant expired Oct. 4, but both sides agreed to hold off any strike or lockout for at least 10 days, with the contract remaining in effect through the period. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> Helicopter has a total of about 6,500 employees. The plant's operations have not been affected by the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union strike elsewhere at <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> because the hourly workers are represented by a different union. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Helicopter </ORGANIZATION> builds <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> CH-47D Chinook helicopters and is a partner with <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Helicopter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Textron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> to develop the V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor plane for the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. It also produces components for <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> commercial jet transports. The <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union's 57,800 members at <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> walked out Oct. 4 after overwhelmingly rejecting a new contract offer from the world's largest commercial jet builder. About 43,300 strikers are in the <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> area, 12,000 in <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, 1,700 in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, and lesser numbers at a half-dozen other locations. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>, general counsel of the <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Professional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said negotiators for that union and <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> probably would meet Monday and Tuesday, then hold sporadic sessions as needed over the next three weeks. Their contract expires Dec. 1, but no one expects a strike by the unaffiliated group, which represents nearly 28,000 engineers, scientists, manual writers, draftsmen and other technical workers.

<HEAD>Weekend Redemptions Running `Light' At Nation's Biggest Stock Fund</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The head of the nation's largest stock mutual fund said redemption requests have been running `` very light'' since Friday's market scare partly because investors are in for the long haul and are n't necessarily spooked by even a large decline. Following last week's 216-point decline in the Dow Jones industrial average, most of which hit during the last hour of trading Friday, some market observers voiced fears that mutual funds would be hit with massive redemptions by clients wanting to get out of the market. That could force fund managers to dump stocks in order to raise enough cash to pay their clients, thereby exacerbating the market turmoil. But money market guru <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON>, who heads <ORGANIZATION> Fidelity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investments </ORGANIZATION>' $ 12.5 billion <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> fund, said Sunday that `` the real fast, aggressive people left before the close on Friday. This weekend -LRB- redemptions have -RRB- been very light.'' <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> admits that over the past six weeks he has increased <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION>'s cash position by $ 350 million to $ 850 million, but it was not because he feared his fund's shareholders would start cashing out. Rather, he said in a telephone interview from his <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> home, `` I have n't been finding that many stocks that are undervalued.'' Investors generally view stock funds as long-term investments and are n't likely to `` rush out and redeem that quickly,'' said <PERSON> Erick </PERSON> <PERSON> Kanter </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, a Washington-based trade association of mutual funds. Stock funds account for roughly 25 percent of total mutual fund assets of $ 242 billion. Most stock funds keep about 10 percent of their total assets in cash. A Gallup survey of 150 <ORGANIZATION> Fidelity </ORGANIZATION> customers late Friday and early Saturday found that 84 percent said they had invested for the long term while 4 percent said they intended to sell their fund shares in the next few weeks. <PERSON> Kanter </PERSON> said that even following Black Monday, Oct. 19, 1987, when the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> plummeted 508 points, only 2 percent of total stock fund assets actually were redeemed. Those who did redeem `` wound up losing a lot because stock funds rebounded very quickly,'' <PERSON> Kanter </PERSON> said. Even <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> posted a gain at the close of 1987, although it was a 1 percent increase rather than the 41 percent gain that the fund had been tracking before Black Monday. Still, <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> has had `` redemptions up until August. ... The public has been very nervous since'87 and has been cutting back pretty steadily.'' <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> said he believed the overall stock market likely would have a net gain for the full year, making 1989 the record-setting eighth consecutive advancing year. `` The reason we've had eight straight years is because we had 16 years of nothing,'' he said. `` The market went sideways or down for 16 years.'' The previous longest advance began in 1896 and lasted for six years, <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s stock exchange, one of the few foreign markets to trade on the weekend after the Wall Street plunge, witnessed frantic trading and a 6.9 percent drop in share value Sunday, officials said. Although the <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> market is small and limited to local stocks, analysts looked to the exchange for signs of how other world markets would react. Among a handful of small foreign markets to trade over the weekend, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> lost ground but <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> posted a small gain. `` What is happening here is a reaction to the news coming from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Friday,'' said <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Nitzani </PERSON>, director of the stock exchange. `` There are large amounts of selling in almost all areas of the market. `` The feeling here is that something very significant happened in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Nitzani </PERSON> said. `` Capital markets do n't like uncertainty, so the first reaction was to get out and wait for things to become clearer.'' Trading was three times its usual volume, with stocks declining in paper value by $ 400 million, <PERSON> Nitzani </PERSON> said in an interview. It was the sharpest fall since October 1987, when Israeli share values were off 8.5 percent in reaction to the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> crash. Sunday's fall in the dollar-linked bond market was less dramatic, down 2 percent. No <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stocks are traded in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and no Israeli stocks are sold on Wall Street, but the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market has strong influence in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> because the two economies are closely intertwined. The <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> exchange is open from Sunday to Thursday and closed Friday and Saturday for the Jewish sabbath. <PERSON> Simcha </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadan </PERSON>, an economist at <ORGANIZATION> Tel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviv </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said on <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> there could be a spillover into <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> because of extensive economic ties between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, its major ally and source of nearly $ 3 billion in annual aid. `` If the American economy gets sick, then we will certainly get pneumonia,'' he said. The director of one of <ORGANIZATION> Tel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviv </ORGANIZATION>'s largest trading houses predicted further drops after <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> openend. `` I am afraid it is not finished,'' he said, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> will probably fall when it opens Monday and that will influence people here as well as in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.''

 Vending machines have come a long way from bubble-gum machines and coffee, soda and candy dispensers. Now a machine will sell you hot, personal-size pizzas, or a fresh cup of cappuccino or espresso coffee. These and other innovations _ along with coinless `` debit card'' machines _ were introduced over the weekend at the annual convention of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automatic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merchandising </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The trade show drew thousands of representatives of the $ 20.9 billion vending machine industry, association spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> said Sunday. The upscale coffee machines, manufactured by the Italian corporation <PERSON> Borghi </PERSON> SpA, crush a small amount of coffee beans for each cup, blast steam through the grounds, and dispense a strong, tasty brew in a tiny cup. `` We're looking for the upscale, higher-end consumers who appreciate a better, European cup of coffee and ethnic groups who do n't like <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> coffee because they find it too diluted,'' said <PERSON> Erick </PERSON> <PERSON> Feitshans </PERSON>, director of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> operations for <PERSON> Borghi </PERSON>. `` We use a filter ... that de-chlorinates and purifies the water,'' said <PERSON> Feitshans </PERSON>, who noted there is an industry trend toward using filtered water `` so we do n't use dirt water out of city plumbing systems.'' The machines also make hot chocolate and regular, American-style coffee for consumers with more conventional tastes. Coffee costs from 80 cents to $ 1.20, with cappuccino the costliest. <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> businessman G.W. Black and his son, <PERSON> Brett </PERSON>, offered a 7-inch cheese and pepperoni pizza that takes 60 seconds to make in their Pizza Chef, a microwave-pizza oven. They hope the $ 2 tab for a pie will be within the budget of college students looking for a late-night snack. `` It's a little bigger than a pan pizza at Pizza Hut and it's a buck cheaper,'' <PERSON> Black </PERSON> said. `` It's not doughy and it's not super crispy. I think we did a good job ... for a microwave pizza.'' <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Vos </PERSON>, owner of <ORGANIZATION> De </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, a vending machine company in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, displayed his `` Deepfrozen'' machine that sells a consumer a frozen dinner and has a built-in microwave oven to heat it up. To make it easier for customers to pay for these items, vendors are moving toward introducing debit card systems, especially on college campuses, <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> said. Customers can feed bills, such as $ 10, into a machine which produces a magnetic-strip credit card. When the card is inserted into a vending machine to buy an item like a 50-cent candy bar, the purchase price is automatically deducted, leaving $ 9.50 on the card. Students at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> are already using the debit cards for the campus cafeteria, vending machines and even washing machines, said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON>, customer service manager for <LOCATION> Debitek </LOCATION>, based in <LOCATION> Chattanooga </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, which makes one of the debit card models. `` And it's much easier for the vending industry,'' he said. `` It takes all the coin mechanisms out of the machine,'' which cuts the maintenance costs for collecting money and unjamming slots. `` It -LRB- the technology -RRB- is here already ... but it looks like this is the year it's going to take off,'' <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> said.

 Japanese investment in American real estate and businesses does not threaten the national security or economic health of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, experts told a conference in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> last week. But strong public resentment over highly publicized Japanese purchases of American companies, like <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s recent $ 3.4 billion takeover of <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION>, indicates <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> should do more to reassure Americans of its good intentions, they said. `` Foreign investment is good for both economies ... as President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> once said, ` a rising tide lifts all the boats,''' said <PERSON> Elliot </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> secretary of both commerce and defense. Aside from helping cover the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade and federal budget deficits, Japanese investment can aid technology transfers and help revitalize <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industries through the sharing by Japanese companies of management and production techniques with American partners, speakers at the conference said. They acknowledged, however, that the perception of Japanese investment among many Americans was strongly negative and could get worse. `` Americans grew up in an era when the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> was the source, not the recipient, of foreign investment. They feel we are losing control of our economic destiny,'' said <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, who heads the Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION>, a conference sponsor. The American sponsors and their Japanese counterpart, the Council for Better Corporate Citizenship, said they held the conference to help the Japanese understand why their investments in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> can be controversial even while the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government welcomes them. In a recent Gallup poll reported in <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION>, 52 percent of the people polled said they viewed Japanese economic might as a greater threat than Soviet military power. Japanese investment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has come under fire largely because of its rapid growth _ twice as fast as that of other nations _ in highly visible areas, <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Armacost </PERSON> told the conference. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s total investment in American real estate, corporations and subsidiaries skyrocketed from $ 4.7 billion in 1980 to $ 53.4 billion in 1988. Of a total $ 65 billion in foreign direct investment in 1988, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> accounted for $ 14.2 billion, just behind <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s $ 21.5 billion. Economists estimate Japanese investment will reach $ 21 billion this year. Highly publicized lawsuits against Japanese firms accusing them of racial and sexual discrimination along with problems in balancing American and Japanese management styles and staff in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> offices have contributed to the backlash against Japanese investment, speakers said. <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, a partner in the New York-based law firm <ORGANIZATION> Milbank </ORGANIZATION>, Tweed, <PERSON> Hadley </PERSON> and <PERSON> McCloy </PERSON>, urged Japanese investors to keep a low profile in making investments _ to `` avoid plastering <ORGANIZATION> ` </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>' all over everything'' _ to seek expert advice to avoid lawsuits over largely avoidable problems, and to hire and promote the best American talent to positions of responsibility <PERSON> Armacost </PERSON> noted that 85 percent of all chief executive officers in Japanese overseas subsidiaries are Japanese, while only 20 percent of the CEO positions in overseas subsidiaries in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> are filled by expatriates. `` Until companies are perceived as creating the best environment for American workers, you wo n't get the best,'' Ms. <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said. Japanese investors can also allay American anxiety over their economic activities by getting more deeply involved in community activities in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, speakers said. `` A Japanese corporation in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> needs to be more responsible to community concerns than it would be at home,'' said <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, singling out the <ORGANIZATION> Hitachi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>'s program of matching grants to community projects. While there is substantial room for improvement in the way Japanese firms operate in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, there is no evidence to support charges that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is `` buying <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> on the cheap,'' said <PERSON> Jonathon </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Colby </PERSON>, a partner in <ORGANIZATION> Blackstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` Japanese companies buy only high-quality assets at a fair price,'' <PERSON> Colby </PERSON> said. Japanese companies operating subsidiaries in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are reinvesting their profits from American operations rather than sending them home, said <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenblatt </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION>. The rate of return from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> affiliates from 1981 to 1988 was only 3.3 percent for Japanese-owned firms, compared with 5.6 percent for all foreign-owned firms in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, indicating that Japanese are investing in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> for the long term, he said. Officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Departments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> said there were no signs that Japanese investment was threatening <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> national security. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullen </PERSON>, deputy undersecretary of defense, said that in cases in which a joint venture would involve the sole <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> company with a strategic product or technology, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> makes arrangements to ensure the deal will not compromise national security.
