<HEAD>Chinese Weekly Accuses Japan of Rewriting War History</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An authoritative Chinese weekly has accused <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> of `` war responsibility phobia'' for trying to gloss over its role in World War II. The <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Review </LOCATION>, in its edition for Tuesday, said attempts by Japanese leaders to deny <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s wartime crimes represent `` a chronic, political disease of an epidemic nature.'' The article was summarized Sunday by the official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has reacted strongly to recent statements by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> that judgement on whether <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> was the aggressor in World War II should be left to future historians. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s Foreign Minister <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> <PERSON> Qichen </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> to attend the funeral of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s wartime head of state Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>, told <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s Foreign Minister Sousuke Uno that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> `` should avoid hurting our people's feelings by denying and distorting history.'' A member of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s legislature accused <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> of `` a gross deception which nobody will believe'' and a commentary in the English-language <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s `` cynical utterances'' will `` smear the image of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> as a trustworthy member of the world community.'' The <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Review recalled the 1982 furor over Japanese history textbooks which <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and other Asian nations said were attempts to whitewash <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s wartime aggression. It also noted the 1986 controversy caused by Education Minister <PERSON> Masayuki </PERSON> <PERSON> Fujio </PERSON>, and a similar dispute last year involving <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> head <PERSON> Seisuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Okuno </PERSON>. Both were forced to resign their cabinet posts after making statements justifying <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s invasions of <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` It is to avoid a repeat of such a historical tragedy that we Chinese pay so much attention to and criticize those irresponsible speeches, which not only whitewash past aggressors, but may also pave the way for militarism,'' the weekly said. It said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s refusal to recognize its responsibilities in the war could impede its drive to become a major diplomatic power. `` If the statesmen of a country lack the courage to face history and accept its reality, and can not obtain trust from the international community, the country can hardly play a major role in world politics.''

 A brother of the armed forces chief said Saturday that the 80 tons of explosives confiscated by the army belongs to the petroleum exploration company for which he works. Military officials had said earlier that the materials belonged to `` leftist subversives'' planning a campaign of terror. But <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Regalado </PERSON>, brother of armed forces chief Gen. <PERSON> Humberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Regalado </PERSON>, said they were innocent exploration materials. `` These materials were used by the company where I work for petroleum exploration,'' he said. However, the government did not immediately confirm <PERSON> Regalado </PERSON>'s claims. <PERSON> Regalado </PERSON> said the dynamite, detonators and liquid explosives were awaiting delivery to the eastern province of Gracias a Dios near the Nicaraguan border for the U.S.-based exploration company <ORGANIZATION> Geosource </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION>. `` I'm no subversive,'' he said. <PERSON> Regalado </PERSON>, 40, said his brother had helped him reclaim the dynamite, which was under guard at a military installation to keep it from being stolen `` or used by leftist guerrilla groups.'' Police and soldiers found the dynamite Thursday in an abandoned house near <LOCATION> Hector </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caraccioli </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ceiba </LOCATION>, about 250 miles north of the capital of <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION>. Col. <PERSON> Erick </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>, chief of the 4th Infantry Batallion, told reporters the dynamite was `` to be used by subversive groups to continue the chain of terrorist acts that lately have unleashed panic in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>.'' He said the military was searching `` intensely'' for the terrorists. On Saturday, <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> refused to confirm or deny <PERSON> Regalado </PERSON>'s account of the explosives to reporters Government sources said there would be an official announcement on the matter within the next few days. He said only that `` our guerrilla search operation continues, particularly on the north coast of <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>.'' Four bombs have gone off in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> in a week, the latest in <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ceiba </LOCATION> at the offices of the New York-based <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Other targets have included the <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION> city hall, an <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> office in the capital, a national telephone company office in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pedro </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sula </LOCATION> and a bus carrying <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers and Honduran civilians in <LOCATION> Comayagua </LOCATION>

 A 9-year-old boy who fell through the ice on a lake with another child Saturday drowned after hoisting his playmate to safety, authorities said.

 While President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> met Sunday with the leaders of modern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sipped tea, watched Chinese dancers and heard a Chinese rendition of `` Yankee Doodle Dandy'' within the walled compound of the last emperor. She then strolled through the royal family garden. `` This is marvelous,'' she said. Although the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> first lady lived in the Chinese capital city when her husband served as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> liaison officer in the mid-1970s, neither the compound nor the <LOCATION> Forbidden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, which Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also planned to visit, was open to the public at the time. Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> attended services Sunday morning with her husband at the <ORGANIZATION> Chongwenmen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, where they worshipped when they lived in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. She then toured the Mansion of the Regent Prince. The elegant and traditional walled compound was the home of the Xuangtong Emperor, better known as <PERSON> Pu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yi </PERSON>. <PERSON> Pu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yi </PERSON>, whose life was told in the award-winning 1987 movie `` The Last Emperor,'' was enthroned in 1909 at the age of 3, but a revolution three years later forced him to abdicate. Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, wearing a blue wool suit and her trademark pearl necklace, had tea and cookies with Chinese and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> women in the garden of the compound. A Chinese band clad in blue traditional robes played string instruments while young women performed dances with a traditional flavor. At the close, they gave a rendition of <ORGANIZATION> Yankee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Doodle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dandy </ORGANIZATION>, and Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> stood up and clapped enthusiastically.'' <PERSON> Pu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yi </PERSON>'s family mansion alongside a northern <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> lake is guarded by huge red doors and an ornate gate, and remains off limits to ordinary sightseers. Like dozens of other aristocratic mansions of old <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, it was taken over by the Communists who took power in 1949. Now, it houses the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. Its stately halls have been divided into tiny offices where hundreds of bureaucrats work under dim light bulbs. However, Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had tea and watched the music and dance program in a separate reception area with about 30 Chinese women. Among those invited was Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Zhu </PERSON> <PERSON> Lin </PERSON>. In the afternoon, Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was to view a newly opened exhibit on <PERSON> Pu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yi </PERSON>'s life in the imperial palace in the heart of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, known as the <LOCATION> Forbidden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Inside two faded wooden halls in a small inner courtyard of the vast palace complex, the exhibit contains <PERSON> Pu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yi </PERSON>'s English-made bicyle, gramophone, childhood toys, set of Encyclopaedia Britannica and wedding robe, its multicolored silk threads still brilliant 67 years later. It also includes a small piano on which <PERSON> Pu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yi </PERSON> sometimes composed traditional-style tunes, and a taped recording of one, titled `` Generals On A Southern Expedition,'' that is played repeatedly for visitors. `` On the day peace is restored, my gentlemen, I shall bid you return and divest you of your battle robes,'' <PERSON> Pu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yi </PERSON> wrote in the lyrics. For <PERSON> Pu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yi </PERSON> and the feeble forces of monarchial restoration, however, there was no victory, even though he continued to live in the palace for 12 years after abdicating. The exhibit is a poignant testimony to the aimlessness and futile hopes of those 12 years. Pictures show him in full court dress seated on a throne during a brief period when he hoped for restoration, and later taking the throne as the puppet ruler of a Japanese-created kingdom of <LOCATION> Manchukuo </LOCATION> in northeast <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Finally, he is shown in padded peasant clothing, exercising with other prisoners in a Communist prison for war criminals. Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s itinerary is very different from <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s, who visited the city in 1984. During her two-day tour, Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> toured the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zoo </LOCATION>, a temple where emperors once offered sacrifices for good harvests, an acupuncture clinic and a kindergarten. Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also had tea at the home of a teacher.

 A car jumped a guard rail and hit a group of sledders Saturday, killing a 4-year-old girl and injuring three other children and three adults, authorities said. A 20-year-old woman lost control of her car around 2:30 p.m. while driving south on the <LOCATION> Garden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Parkway </LOCATION> in southeastern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, said State Police Sgt. <PERSON> Stacy </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranmer </PERSON>. The car went over the guard rail and hit the group, which was standing on top of the embankment, then slid 75 feet to the bottom of the hill, <PERSON> Cranmer </PERSON> said. A 6-year-old boy was in critical condition with head injuries after being airlifted to <ORGANIZATION> Cooper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Camden </LOCATION>, nursing supervisor <PERSON> Helene </PERSON> <PERSON> Zehnder </PERSON> said.

A 31-year-old woman, a 31-year-old man and a 41-year-old man were all in serious but stable condition at the medical center with broken bones and head injuries, the sergeant said. The driver's condition was not immediately known The victims all were from the <LOCATION> Absecon </LOCATION> area. Neither the victims' nor the driver's names were released When the accident occurred, about 50 people were in the area, which is within walking distance of homes, <PERSON> Cranmer </PERSON> said. `` It's a good sledding hill. The thing is they were n't supposed to be there,'' <PERSON> Cranmer </PERSON> said, adding that a trooper had told a group of people to leave the area about 45 minutes before the accident. `` This is an ongoing problem that we've had for years. `` How do you stop it? Do you arrest people for trespassing?'' <PERSON> Cranmer </PERSON> asked. `` I do n't know how you prevent it. `` When there's snow and there's kids, all the reasoning in the world wo n't stop it.''

 A majority of Americans approve of the job President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is doing, according to a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Times-CBS News Poll. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> received a 61 percent approval rating for his first month in office, higher than the 55 percent rating given President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in his first month in office in a 1981 Gallup poll, the Times reported in Sunday's editions. In the new poll of 1,223 adults, only 9 percent of those surveyed disapproved of the young <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. Thirty percent of the respondents said they did not know enough about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to venture an opinion. The Feb. 18-19 survey was completed before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> voted against the nomination of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> to be Secretary of <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION>, and did not include any questions about the Tower nomination.

Geographically, he got his highest approval rating, 67 percent, in the South. His lowest, 54 percent, was in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. Among respondents who said their families earn more than $ 35,000 a year, 73 percent voiced approval of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, while 6 percent voiced disapproval, the Times said.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Sunday traded banter with senior <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>, got `` right down to business'' on a range of topics with Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> and returned to a church where he and his wife <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> had worshipped in 1974-75. The president was bid a `` hearty welcome'' by <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> as they two began a session at the Great Hall of the People. During a picture-taking opportunity, <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>, 84, thanked <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for visiting <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> `` shortly after you took office'' and said, `` we two have been good friends.'' `` I'm delighted to see you looking so well,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> leader, who appeared healthy.

In his meeting with <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>, the two talked about sports and cards. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> told <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: `` you're an athlete. That's why you're in good shape.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> replied: `` I keep trying.'' <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> agreed that sports were important, and said that the one sport they had in common was `` playing bridge.'' `` I gave up bridge a long time ago, too complicated, too difficult,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> said he expected <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s job as president would make it even harder to find time to play the card game. `` I know it's a hard job to be the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and you will be the champion of the world in terms of having the busiest work schedule,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> apologized to <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> that his visit to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> was `` very short,'' just 40 hours. Earlier, the Bushes attended a church that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called `` our home away from home'' in the heart of the Chinese capital. He told the <ORGANIZATION> Chongwenmen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> congregation that a strong faith in God helps people cope with seemingly insurmountable problems. Just before going into his meetings with top Chinese officials, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> mixed secular and spiritual talk in brief remarks to roughly 1,400 worshippers seated in the sanctuary of the church hidden behind high stone walls. Speaking through an interpreter, he said that while relations between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> are basically sound, `` Sometimes our problems can seem bigger than life itself _ intractable and fearsome. But I am convinced that, with each other, with our faith in God, we can meet any challenge, and we will.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> met later Sunday with <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> resistance leader Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said there were no new developments at that meeting, and that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had reiterated his support for a reconcilation government in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> with the prince at the head of it. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> also said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> assured Chinese leaders that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> continues to subscribe to its one-China policy and believes that the problem of <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> is one that should be resolved `` by the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> people'' without pressure from outside. He also said that Chinese leaders assured <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> that the Chinese would not sell missiles to other nations, with the exception of <LOCATION> Saudia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, with which the Chinese has contractual commitments. `` This relationship is as important as any we have anywhgere in the world,' Fitzwater quoted <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as telling his hosts. `` They will not be affected by rapid changes in other relationships,'' the president said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his wife lived here in 1974-75 when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was the head of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liaison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> in the period just before the formal restoration of diplomatic relations between the two world giants. During his talk Sunday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> noted that his daughter, <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> LeBlond </PERSON>, had been baptized at the <ORGANIZATION> Chongwenmen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> here in 1975, when she was 16. `` That gives us a special feeling of identity and warmth,'' he said. To the predominantly <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> congregation seated in the octagonal brick building with dark wood paneling and a neon cross, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> praised `` our church away from home.'' `` It's a little different, though,'' he said. `` Today we came up with 20 motor cars, with a motorcade, and I used to come to church on my bicycle, a Flying Pigeon,'' he said. At one point he picked up a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> baby and cuddled it, and the baby said `` grandfather'' in Chinese. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> presented church with a gift Bible, saying `` it comes to you with our heartfelt thanks and our love.'' `` This church, in a sense, was our home away from home,'' he said. On Saturday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> mingled with people at a downtown landmark, delivered a `` thank you'' in Chinese and presented <PERSON> Li </PERSON> with a pair of black leather boots from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, here for a two-day working visit, and Chinese President <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Shangkun </PERSON> toasted each other at the banquet in the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> the </LOCATION> <LOCATION> People </LOCATION> with vows to strengthen relations, while both hinted at issues that remain sources of friction. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made veiled references to human rights concerns and weapons proliferation while <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> cautioned that `` twists and turns and relapses may occur in the process of relaxation.'' But <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> told <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> that his visit, coming so soon after his inauguration, was a `` big event'' in U.S.-Chinese relations. `` The Chinese leaders attach great importance to your current visit. ... The Chinese people know you well, and so do you know them,'' <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> returned the praise, claiming `` the world as a whole is watching the larger movement of our two great nations as we build even firmer bonds across the vast ocean that joins us.'' The first lady had a separate schedule for part of the day, visiting the childhood home of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s last emperor, <PERSON> Pu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yi </PERSON>, and touring the <LOCATION> Forbidden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, the sprawling walled residence of the imperial rulers. On Monday, the president and his wife head to <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, for a visit that will conclude their Far East trip. The Korean government has put 120,000 police on alert in anticipation of anti-American protest demonstrations.

 A preliminary investigation has raised the possibility that stress, and not a bomb or metal fatigue, ripped open a jumbo jet, hurling nine people to their deaths, federal officials said Saturday. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> ships, meanwhile, spent the day searching 3,000 square miles of ocean for debris from the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jet, which made an emergency landing Friday with a 10-foot-wide, 40-foot-high hole in its side. The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 had been en route to <LOCATION> Auckland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, with 336 passengers and 18 crew members aboard. `` Nothing yet gives us any indication of a bomb in the cargo area, but we are not drawing any conclusions yet,'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON>, an investigator with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> told a news conference Saturday night. <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents searched the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747's cargo area with dogs earlier Saturday, but found no evidence of explosives. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Marx </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION>'s senior metallurgist, said there was no evidence that metal fatigue caused the hole. <PERSON> Marx </PERSON> said the condition of the hole's edge indicated that `` overstress'' _ a stress greater than the plane could stand _ had been placed on the aircraft, but did not say what it might have been. However, neither <PERSON> Marx </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> would rule out metal fatigue as a possible cause. A key question for investigators is whether the loss of a cargo door was a cause or a result of the plane tearing open. `` If a door opened in flight, it could possibly cause overstress,'' <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said in response to a reporter's question. <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> added that the condition could be caused by other factors he declined to explain. The government last July ordered airlines to improve cargo door lock systems on older <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747s after one partly opened in flight. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> followed the directive as far as an initial inspection, but had not added an aluminum and steel part required to be installed on the door by Dec. 31 of this year, spokesman <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. United has completed the addition on six of 25 aircraft it applies to, he said. <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said the pilot and co-pilot of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> Flight 811 told investigators Saturday there was no indication of trouble closing the cargo doors. <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said a warning light in the cockpit would indicate if the doors were not closed properly. The hole follows the dimensions of the cargo door `` exactly'' and flares further up the aircraft, <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said. Investigators began examining the damaged jet earlier in the day. A dozen people involved in the investigation peered into the exposed cargo hold as workers removed baggage from the jumbo jet and a military police officer armed with an M-16 rifle kept reporters and photographers at least 50 yards away. Aviation experts said earlier the most likely cause was metal fatigue. However, three <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> bomb experts from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> were sent to join the investigation. Between 70 and 100 people are participating in the investigation, including 16 from the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION>, to look into every possible cause, said <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON>. `` The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> is also here working with us because, as I've said earlier all doors are open,'' said <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON>. `` All doors are completely wide open.'' Investigators may make some preliminary findings, but it will take nine to 12 months to determine the cause of the incident, <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said. One of three <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> cutters searching the ocean south of here Saturday afternoon retrieved part of an overhead compartment, said Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellner </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> also found safety instruction cards with `` <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>'' on them, seat cushions and personal items including shoes and a teddy bear, <PERSON> Ellner </PERSON> said. Six Americans, two Australians and a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealander </LOCATION> aboard <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> Flight 811 were instantly blown through the opening, and at least one was sucked into one of the jet's engines, authorities said. The airplane was at 20,000 feet when the accident happened. <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> hospitals reported treating 27 people, mostly for minor injuries. Officials said three people remained in hospitals Saturday: a 48-year-old flight attendant in fair condition with broken bones in her neck and upper back and abdominal injuries, a flight attendant recovering from surgery on a fractured arm, and a 73-year-old <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> man in fair condition with heart problems. More than 200 people boarded other flights; those who did n't want to fly were put up in hotels. Early Saturday, 110 passengers from Flight 811 arrived in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> aboard a special <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> flight. `` It was a nightmare and I'm glad I got back on that plane today because if I'd waited I do n't know if I would have ever flown again,'' said <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Mehan </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, who said she was sitting about 10-12 rows behind the hole in the fuselage of Flight 811. `` I think that the United crew did an excellent, incredible job. The pilot should be recommended, commended _ he was fantastic,'' she said. `` I was afraid, I did n't think we were gon na make it ... I thought that this was the end.'' At dawn, three <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ships and helicopters resumed their search of the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> about 100 miles south of here for debris from the plane. A vessel Friday found two airline seat cushions and a 4-by-6-foot piece of metal believed to be from the jet, <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Spangler </PERSON> said. Authorities had not decided late Saturday whether the search would continue Sunday, <PERSON> Spangler </PERSON> said. The nine missing passengers were identified as <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Morristown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Harley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Hackensack </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Fallon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Fallon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Handley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wellington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>; and Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Swann </PERSON>, both of <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. According to <ORGANIZATION> Hawaii </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Kali </PERSON>, the 18-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747, the oldest in <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s jumbo jet fleet, took off for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> at 1:34 a.m Pilot <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON> heard `` a loud thump'' just before the No. 3 engine failed a few minutes into the flight. A short time later, the No. 4 engine fire indicator activated and <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON> shut it down. At 2:16 a.m., <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON> radioed the traffic control tower, asking for emergency vehicles, which were standing by when the plane landed at 2:33 a.m. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON> would have no comment. Investigators recovered small body fragments and pieces of clothing in the jet's No. 3 engine, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Honolulu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Examiner </ORGANIZATION>'s Office. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Starrett </PERSON>, a medical examiner investigator, said it was unlikely officials would be able to identify the remains, even as male or female. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Speicher </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION> vice president, said he hopes to have the plane repaired and returned to service in three or four months. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagin </PERSON> said the jet had undergone a complete four-day inspection 88 days before the accident, and a less intensive check Feb. 16. `` It has no history of maintenance problems. This aircraft had a routine maintenance history,'' <PERSON> Nagin </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bobbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Nardis </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, where safety records are kept, said cracks were once found near the structure that holds the engine to the wing. She said the plane also once had an engine fire. But Ms. <PERSON> Nardis </PERSON> said `` people who work with these reports all the time'' said the plane had nothing on its record that particularly distinguished it from other jumbo jets.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> toasted `` new progress'' in Sino-American relations Sunday, and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> assured <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> that their ties would not be weakened by Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s plans to visit <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> this spring. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also raised previously expressed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> concerns about proliferation of nuclear missiles. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is one of the world's biggest arms merchants White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> reaffirmed an earlier commitment by <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> would not sell missiles to any country other than <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>. Later, however, deputy White House press secretary <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> <PERSON> Popadiuk </PERSON> said <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> had misspoken. <PERSON> Popadiuk </PERSON> said <PERSON> Li </PERSON> did not discuss specifics but merely restated assurances given last October that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> would act in `` a responsible manner'' regarding missile sales. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has said it is satisfied with that policy. Before heading for <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> en route home to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> appeared on the government-run television network for a live, 15-minute interview by <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> journalists _ an unprecedented event for a foreign visitor here. He also entertained his Chinese hosts at a farewell banquet featuring a Texas-style barbecue and Lone Star beer. But one of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s invited guests, leading Chinese dissident <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> <PERSON> Lizhi </PERSON>, was barred at the front door of the hotel by <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> police, according to an American witness. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had invited <PERSON> Fang </PERSON>, a respected astrophysicist, as a gesture of support for a small group of Chinese intellectuals who have called for greater political freedom. `` This really shows <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s attitude toward human rights,'' <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> said later in a telephone interview `` At the most, I would have been able to say hello to the president.'' White House officials, when asked about the incident, had no immediate comment. It was not known if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was aware of <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> and his wife's forcible exclusion from the banquet. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> had said earlier it was unlikely that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would have spoken to <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> at the dinner. South Korean authorities meanwhile braced for the threat of violent anti-American demonstrations when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> flies to <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> on Monday for a three-hour visit that will include talks with government leaders and an address to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. An estimated 120,000 police, security agents and commandos were put on alert. During the TV interview, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> expressed hope for expanded U.S.-China trade, which he said already had grown from $ 800 million in the mid-1970s to $ 14 billion today. `` We are prepared to go the extra mile in terms of investments, in terms of business, exports and imports,'' he told a questioner. In his toast at the farewell banquet, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he was leaving <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> `` convinced that U.S.-China relations are strong.'' `` We have great responsibilities and also great possibilities,'' the president added, promising to work with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s leadership to `` help make this world a safer, more peaceful place for us all.'' <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>, 84, the country's senior leader, expressed `` a hearty welcome'' as he greeted <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the cavernous Great Hall of the People. `` We two have been good friends,'' <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> told his visitor. Throughout the final day of his visit to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> emphasized a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> desire for warm relations with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. As his rode around <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> in a black limousine, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> repeatedly used a microphone in the car to say `` thank you, thank you'' to thousands of <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> people who lined the streets. However, the air of cordiality was marred when <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> security guards pushed and shoved people away from <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> when the president's wife toured the <LOCATION> Forbidden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, ancient home of Chinese emperors. <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Powers </PERSON>, a White House photographer accompanying the first lady, was pushed face-first into a door. Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> interrupted the tour to declare, `` This girl's job is to take my picture and she got hit. She works for my husband.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the security guards should `` calm down.'' Later, Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> produced Ms. Powers at a news conference and reported that `` she's fine.'' The president and <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> established a warm relationship during <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s tenure as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> envoy to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> in the mid-1970s, before formal diplomatic relations were restored between their two countries. On Sunday, they bantered about playing bridge, one of the Chinese leader's passions. `` I gave up bridge a long time ago _ too complicated, too difficult. You are the expert,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>. `` Now it's even more difficult for you to find time to play bridge,'' <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> responded. `` I know it's a hard job to be the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and you will be the champion of the world in terms of having the busiest work schedule.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> conferred separately with <PERSON> Li </PERSON> for two hours. `` This relationship is as important as any we have anywhere in the world,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. In the past, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has expressed concern over human rights in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, but the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not raise the subject during his two-day visit this time. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, dressed in a Western business suit, and <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>, wearing a gray <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> suit, spent most of their hour-long meeting discussing East-West relations, focusing on <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s scheduled trip to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> in May. It will be the first Sino-Soviet summit meeting in three decades. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the president told <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> welcomes <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s trip as an `` important and useful step in providing stability to the region and the world.'' `` He -LRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> -RRB- wanted to assure the chairman that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy with regard to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> would not be affected by the outcome of those discussions,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. The spokesman said <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> spoke at length about the history of Soviet-Chinese relations and `` the difficulties he faces in having this meeting'' with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> as part of a `` normalization process.'' <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> almost never hosts luncheons for foreign leaders, but made an exception for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> said he would n't give a speech but added: `` Let us all raise our glasses to the health of President and Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and other American friends and to the new progress in China-U. relations.'' <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> downed a small glass of mao-tai, a potent sorghum liquor. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did the same. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was encouraged by developments on the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> peninsula and hoped <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> would use its influence with <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to engage in talks with the <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> government. On the delicate issue of <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is committed to a `` one-China'' policy and that the future of <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, home of the Chinese Nationalist government ousted from the mainland in 1949, must be worked out by <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> government. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is unhappy about <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms sales to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and has urged <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to be more aggressive in promoting contacts between <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also met on Sunday with Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and said that `` we strongly support'' the exiled resistance leader in his campaign for withdrawal of Vietnamese occupation forces from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. Both the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> want <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> to lead a coalition government in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 In the hijacking trial of <PERSON> Fawaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Younis </PERSON>, under way in federal court, the government is trying to keep secrets about how it nabbed the Lebanese militiaman in an undercover operation in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> is the first suspect arrested overseas and tried under the 1984 Hostage-Taking Act, which gives the government `` long arm'' jurisdiction in cases involving American hostages. <PERSON> Younis </PERSON>, 29, is a relative small fry, said <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Livingstone </PERSON>, an expert on terrorism. `` This is not the <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dillinger </PERSON> of the terrorist world. He is a relatively low-level terrorist,'' <PERSON> Livingstone </PERSON> said. But to nab him federal authorities cast a multi-million dollar net involving undercover agents, an aircraft carrier, helicopters and a fleet of aircraft, according to court arguments and documents in the case. Four days after his arrest on Sept. 13, 1987, <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> was flown to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in a 13-hour flight aboard a plane that refueled several times in the air, avoiding any contact with foreign governments that might have clouded <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> jurisdiction in the case. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agents used sensitive intelligence methods in making the arrest, and a number of the key players in the case are living under new identities in the federal witness protection program, prosecutors said during a pretrial hearing on Wednesday. At the hearing, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Distrist Chief Judge <PERSON> Aubrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> denied requests by defense attorney <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> for access to classified information in 12 categories, ranging from the names of high-level policymakers who helped plan the arrest to details about <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and intelligence assets used in the case. <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> is accused of leading a band of men who, armed with AK-47 assault rifles, shot their way past security guards and boarded a Royal Jordanian jetliner in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on June 11, 1985. <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> was a member of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> militia, a Shiite Moslem faction. He was under orders to fly the plane to <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>, where an <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> meeting was under way, and read a statement demanding the withdrawal of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> guerrillas from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, defense counsel <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said Wednesday. Tunisian authorities denied the plane permission to land and it returned to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The evidence against <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> includes a videotape of him on the <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> tarmac, armed with an assault rifle, announcing that the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 would be blown up. One of the passengers, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Slade </PERSON>, has also testified that <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> emerged from the plane's cockpit several times during the 39-hour hijacking and ordered other hijackers to stop beating Jordanian skymarshals. The beatings resumed when <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> returned to the cockpit, <PERSON> Slade </PERSON> testified, identifying the defendant in the courtroom. No one was killed in the hijacking. In Septmeber 1987, <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> was lured to the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> island of <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> by a friend, identified by federal authorities as <PERSON> Jamal </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamdan </PERSON>. Court papers contain the transcript of a conversation clandestinely recorded at <PERSON> Hamdan </PERSON>'s apartment on <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, in which <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> said he was picked for the hijacking by the head of <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Nabih </PERSON> <PERSON> Berri </PERSON>, who is also <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s justice minister. <PERSON> Berri </PERSON> has denounced the arrest as `` an attack against the honor of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.'' During pretrial argument, the defense attorney said he would not contend that <PERSON> Berri </PERSON> ordered the hijacking, but that his client would testify that he was under orders to pirate a plane to <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>. According to the defense attorney's arguments in court, <PERSON> Jamal </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamdan </PERSON> and his brother <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> lured <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> to a two-masted sailboat with the promise of a drug deal and a party. Two <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents, a man and a woman, were aboard the yacht, which was located in international waters to avoid the need for extradition hearings. In the struggle to arrest <PERSON> Younis </PERSON>, both his wrists suffered hairline fractures, federal authorities said when they announced the arrest. <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> was transferred to a naval supply vessel, the USS Butte, which took four days to carry him to the western <LOCATION> Mediterrean </LOCATION>, where he was moved to the carrier <ORGANIZATION> USS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Saratoga </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said at the hearing. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> asked to introduce evidence that five doctors were flown by helicopter to the <LOCATION> Saratoga </LOCATION> beforehand in the event that <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> was hurt, but that the defendant was not treated until after he confessed. `` The only medication my client received was a bag of ice,'' the defense attorney said. The court, said the judge, `` will allow the defense to argue that four days is a long time to transport the defendant from the eastern <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> to the western Mediterranean'' and that `` that there was not a normal complement aboard the ship,'' said <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>. The defense, in debating whether the `` confession was free and voluntary,'' will be allowed to argue that there was `` undue delay'' in diagnosing and treating <PERSON> Younis </PERSON>, the judge said.

 A warning light indicated there was a fire aboard a jumbo jet that landed at <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> on Sunday, but firefighters who rushed to the scene discovered it was a false alarm, <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> said.

The warning light on British Airways Flight 292 suggested there was a fire in the plane's auxiliary power unit, located in the tail of the plane. The unit provides power for the aircraft when the main engines are switched off.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> met with Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> on Sunday and expressed support for the resistance leader's efforts to end <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s 10-year occupation of his country `` We wish you well and respect the resistance you represent,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the 66-year-old <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> during their 20-minute meeting at the <ORGANIZATION> Diaoyutai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, where both were residing. White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made no new commitments to the prince. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> provides non-lethal aid to the <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> faction and a second non-Communist group seeking the withdrawal of Vietnamese occupation forces from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. The third resistance force is the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, which took power in 1975 and killed an estimated 1 million of their countrymen with fanatic agrarian policies before <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> invaded and drove them into the jungles in late 1978. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is the main supplier of arms to the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, which receives no <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told Chinese Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> on Sunday that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> rejects a dominant role for the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> in any future Cambodian government. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> repeated <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s position that <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> should withdraw all its troops and that <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> should head a four-party coalition government, which would include the three resistance groups and the Vietnam-backed Phnom Penh government. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said no single party should dominate the coalition. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said he could not recall any discussion between <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Li </PERSON> on the question of <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> arms supplies to the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> tentatively has agreed to end arms shipments to the guerrillas if <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> fulfills a pledge to withdraw all its troops by September. The mercurial <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, who is noted for his frequent quarrels with his resistance partners, arrived at <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s villa after a limousine ride from his own residence about 100 yards away. The prince was greeted by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy officials and Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Gaston </PERSON> <PERSON> Sigur </PERSON>, but stood outside <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s villa for about 10 minutes, apparently reluctant to enter until the president appeared at the door. When <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> showed up, <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> greeted him warmly and they went inside together. <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> was driven from the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> throne in 1970 in a coup he claimed was engineered by the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. Then strongly anti-American, he returned to his homeland in 1975 when the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> gained power but was immediately placed under house arrest. <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> fled <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> when <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> invaded and has spent the past decade wandering in exile in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. He has been living at the <LOCATION> Diaoyutai </LOCATION> guest house here for more than a month. Last month, he resumed presidency of the three-party resistance one year after he quit in anger over alleged <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> attacks on his troops.

 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s state-run media gave President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s visit unprecedented coverage, broadcasting the first live interview of a foreign leader in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and portraying the new president as a man of the people The two-day visit was front-page news on all of the country's major newspapers Sunday morning, and it led the nation's radio broadcasts throughout the day In an unusual move, stations carried a broadcast of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> speaking in English to a welcoming banquet. A Chinese translation followed. The visit also led the nationwide television news on Saturday and Sunday nights. On Sunday, the broadcast showed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> shaking hands warmly and exchanging toasts with <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was also seen meeting Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON>. The news also broadcast pictures of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> during and after his television interview. `` With many thanks,'' the president wrote to <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> as the camera zoomed in. `` The biggest audience I've ever had _ by far.'' As with all Chinese reports, sensitive topics were dropped from the written copy. Chinese media made no mention of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s call for respect for individual rights and his opposition to arms sales `` in regions of the world marked by conflict.'' The references, however veiled, were to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hopes for greater personal freedoms in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and that the nation stop selling arms in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. Still, the coverage was exhaustive. The English-language service of the <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> churned out about 30 stories and one exclusive interview with the president in less than 24 hours. The media blitz is an indication of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s hopes for even better ties with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. It also is a sign of growing Chinese curiosity in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Finally, it shows the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> leadership's fascination with <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> himself, a man they describe as an `` old friend'' and who they openly supported in last year's presidential election. A waving <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> beamed from the front page of the People's Daily, the official organ of the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the nation's biggest paper, printing 4 million copies a day It ran three stories on the presidential visit. The <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Daily, the main newspaper for the capital, portrayed the new president as a man of the people. `` If the visit was n't such a short one, maybe President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his wife would ride their ` Flying Pigeon' bicyles once again to <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>,'' the report said. The reference was to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s 13-month sojourn in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> as head of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liaison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> in 1974-75. `` At that time,'' the story said, `` he and his wife, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>, often rode their bikes along the big and small roads of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> for exercise, to directly understand Chinese society and have more contact with the people.'' In an editorial, the People's Daily said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has put `` clean government'' and `` cooperation with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>'' on the top of his agenda. An analysis last week said `` the new president has already walked out from under <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s shadow.'' But the top item in the media blitz was <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s 15-minute interview on <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION>. `` I've spoke to the American people about a new breeze blowing,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in his opening statement before the interview began. `` <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> was one of the first nations to feel this breeze.'' Sitting in front of a painting of scenic <LOCATION> Guilin </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> smiled often as he answered questions mainly about trade relations with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The questions were asked in English and appeared in <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> as subtitles along the bottom of the screen. A <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> interpreter translated for the president. `` This is the first live interview ever with a foreign leader,'' said an editor earlier Sunday. `` We're pretty excited about it here. We're expecting at least 100 million people to be watching.''

 Everywhere <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> went on Sunday he ran into old Chinese friends, from Chairman <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> to the fellow who used to cut his hair and his onetime tennis partner. With <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> engaged in casual chatter and shook off the old chairman's suggestion that they get together for a game of bridge some time. `` You're too good,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. He lived in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> during 1974-75 as head of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liaison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, before establishment of U.S.-Sino diplomatic ties. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> stopped at the International Club to have a word with a `` Mr. <PERSON> Wong </PERSON>,'' the tennis pro, who, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> claimed, has been quoted in the newspapers back home as saying that he used to beat <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> regularly at tennis. `` I had to stop off and talk to him about that story,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in later apologizing to the staff at the American embassy for being late. He said he also had wanted to look up his barber at the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, a meeting place for foreigners in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The barber, <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Bo </PERSON>, now assistant manager of the club said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sends the club greeting cards every new year and Christmas. `` We're old friends,'' he told the official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agnecy </ORGANIZATION> Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> practiced Chinese `` tai qi'' exercises at the club, the agency said. Enroute from the club to the embassy, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> used a loudspeaker to shout `` Thank You'' from his limousine to Chinese crowds congregated along the way. At the embassy, he said, he was delighted to have run into `` several of our Chinese friends, co-workers that worked with <PERSON> Barabara </PERSON> and me right in this very house.'' In the courtyard on the way out, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> paused to pose with a group of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cub </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scouts </ORGANIZATION> and Brownies who had waited in the breeze for more than an hour. Who are these kids? someone asked. Replied their adult leader: `` Frozen brownies.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s most emotional reunion came at the pulpit of the <ORGANIZATION> Chongwenmen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, where the Rev. <PERSON> Yin </PERSON> <PERSON> Jizeng </PERSON> led the services. <PERSON> Yin </PERSON> had baptized the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s daughter, <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON>, when the family lived in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. From the pulpit, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> recalled those days. He said he used to arrive at Sunday services on his Flying Pigeon bicycle, instead of at the head of a flashing 20-car motorcade that carried him on Sunday. Back then, only foreigners could attend church services in <LOCATION> Bejing </LOCATION>. Sunday 1,400 worshippers crowded into the octogonal church. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has a billion people; 4 million of them are Protestants. When <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> pulled in at the International Club a handful of Americans awaited him outside. They broke into song: `` God Bless America.'' Among them, symbolic of the new <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the new relationship with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, was <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Law </PERSON>, a poultry geneticist from <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, who said he was involved in a joint business venture to teach the Chinese how to raise their own breeding chickens. The Chinese must import breeders now, but in a few years will be raising 10 million of them, he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> kidded the staff at the embassy about the exhaustive preparations that are made when a president comes calling. `` I know something about a visit from a president,'' he said. `` We had one when I was out here before this was an embassy. And I sure was glad to see him go!'' The visiting president in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s past case was <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>. `` And if that was n't enough,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> added in reference to the former globetrotting secretary of state, `` we survived two -LRB- visits -RRB- from <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON>!'' That was the sort of day it was for the visiting American president _ light-hearted interludes between bouts of diplomacy. When <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who had gone off by herself to see the <LOCATION> Forbidden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, joined him for lunch at the Great Hall of the People, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was just finishing shaking the hands of some Chinese potentates. He saw her, and shook hers, too. `` How do you do?'' he asked her with artificial formality. She gave him a look, and a friendly pat on the back. With tiny Chairman <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>, who comes up about to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s midriff, the talk was exceptionally casual. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> is famous for his interest in playing bridge. During the Cultural Revolution, when he was ousted from power, he passed his days at a bridge table. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> told <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> it is a sport they have in common. He challenged the president to a game sometime. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: `` You're too good.'' <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>:'' It's hard to say We have n't played together. But even if we play bridge together, it will be a friendly game.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: `` I gave up bridge a long time ago. Too complicated. Too difficult. You are the expert.'' Then they went off to one of those big Chinese luncheon banquets. Afterward, as he hurried down the steps of the Great Hall to his limousine, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was asked how it went at lunch. `` Ate too much,'' was the cryptic reply.

<HEAD>More Inflation-Fighting Moves, Higher Interest Rates Seen Likely</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>'s decision last week to boost its key lending rate to combat inflation is likely to be followed by further credit-tightening moves and even higher interest rates, many analysts believe. They say the central bank's move to increase the discount rate by a half-percentage point to 7 percent on Friday came too late and was too mild to effectively quell an inflation spiral, and that further steps to cool the overheating economy will be necessary. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> is signaling that it's definitely trying to encourage higher rates in order to fight the inflationary pressure,'' said <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ratajczak </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forecasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` The only question is whether they're signaling a little late and a little timidly,'' he said. `` They definitely are late and a half-point -LRB- increase -RRB- is a little timid.'' Boosting the discount rate, the fee the central bank charges for short-term loans to banks, is the strongest signal the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> can send of its concern about inflation. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> also has been employing more subtle credit-tightening moves for the past year, reducing the availability of cash and thus driving up the interest rates that banks charge when making loans. Major banks last week boosted their prime rate _ charged to the most credit-worthy commercial customers _ for the second time in two weeks to 11.5 percent as lenders continue to pass along their higher costs for funds. A variety of lending rates covering everything from home mortgages to new cars are expected to ratchet upward as a result of the latest round of <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> tightening, and the pattern is expected to repeat itself. `` Until the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> sees some clear evidence that the economy is slowing down, it is going to continue to tighten,'' said economist <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. `` It believes the economy is running too fast, inflation is accelerating and it's going to put on the brakes But it takes awhile for the brakes to work.'' Higher interest rates are used to gradually moderate economic growth in an effort to avoid the higher prices caused by tight labor markets and supply bottlenecks. Concern about inflation heightened last week after the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that consumer prices were up 0.6 percent in January, the biggest increase in two years. Earlier reports showed wholesale prices were up 1 percent last month and indicated the economy has yet to slow down in response to the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s efforts to maneuver a so-called `` soft landing'' to the 6-year-old economic expansion. <PERSON> Ratajczak </PERSON> said that with inflation unlikely to flag in the near future, interest rates are bound nowhere but up. `` I think we're going to see some more bad inflation numbers and I think we're going to see some higher interest rates,'' he said. `` Cumulatively, the higher interest rates will slow down the economy.'' A similar theme was sounded by economist <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Aubrey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lanston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, who said the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s latest action brought it `` at best, roughly even with the inflation curve.'' `` The inflation numbers will continue to show a tendency to accelerate and it will require further <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> tightening steps,'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. Most economists are expecting inflation this year to be in the range of 5 percent to 5.5 percent, up from 4.4 percent in the last two years. While still far short of the double-digit levels of the 1970s, the current inflation rates have been labeled `` unacceptable'' by <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>. `` If inflation emerges, I think a recession will move up on us much more quickly than we can imagine and when it occurs it will be a prolonged one,'' he warned in congressional testimony last week. <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON> said that while boosting interest rates is not the ideal cure for inflation, `` it's the only lever the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has.'' `` I do n't think they have much alternative but to pull it.''

 First Lady <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, returning Sunday to favorite sites in the old imperial palace, patted an ancient `` Republican elephant'' statue for luck and asked that heavy-handed Chinese guards go easier on photographers with her. During the rushed one-hour tour of the vast palace complex, Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said she missed the leisurely pace of her visits there in 1974-75, when President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was stationed in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Liaison officer. `` I'm glad I'd seen it before,'' she said as she strode across a wide, stone-paved plaza between towering gold-roofed halls of the <LOCATION> Forbidden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, now called the Palace Museum. `` Before I used to ride my bike over, give someone 2 cents and spend the afternoon with a houseguest,'' she said. The 2 cents was the bike parking fee. Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> greeted a familiar bronze statue of a kneeling elephant near the palace's rear gate with delight, crying out, `` There's my Republican elephant.'' `` Do you think it's good luck to touch it?'' she asked her escort, museum director <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Xin </PERSON>. When he nodded, smiling, she reached out and stroked its tusk. She also stopped to admire a pine tree in the palace garden with speckled silver bark, saying, `` It's really very unusual. I used to know its name.'' Hundreds of Chinese tourists, kept to the sides by security guards, watched bemused and curious as Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s entourage of about 100 guards, aides and journalists walked the more than 1.5 miles of the complex. `` Oh, so the president's wife is coming,'' said a gap-toothed peasant from northwest <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> who was visiting <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> for the first time with a group of friends. `` No, I do n't recognize her name.'' Chinese security was heavy. Inside the <LOCATION> Forbidden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, one guard slammed a <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> photographer, <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Powers </PERSON>, face-first into a door as he tried to maneuver her back from Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said to her escorts, `` Ask them to calm down,'' referring to the security guards. `` This girl's job is to take my picture and she got hit. She works for my husband.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said later that Ms. Powers was not hurt. But she warned other photographers running to take her picture to be careful, calling out, `` I do n't want to worry about you like I'm your mother.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, wearing a blue suit by American designer <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Scaasi </PERSON>, low-heeled shoes and her trademark pearls, stopped to see a new exhibit about the life of <PERSON> Pu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yi </PERSON>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s last emperor, who was the subject of the award-winning 1987 movie `` The Last Emperor.'' The exhibit in two faded wooden halls contains <PERSON> Pu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yi </PERSON>'s English-made bicycle, piano and other personal memorabilia When <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> complimented her on her youthful appearance, the 63-year-old Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> laughed heartily and said, `` I'm in high spirits, not young.'' She joked that she would have qualified to attend a banquet one 18th-century Chinese emperor gave in the palace for `` people 60 and over.'' `` That's my crowd,'' she said. Earlier Sunday, Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> accompanied her husband to a church service presided over by ministers they knew when they lived in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. They also went together to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> to visit <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> barbers who used to cut their hair and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s former tennis partner. The rest of the day, while the president met with Chinese leaders, Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bette </PERSON> <PERSON> Bao </PERSON> <PERSON> Lord </PERSON>, the wife of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador, went on tour. She chatted over tea with several dozen <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> women, including scholars and the wives of Cabinet ministers, in a theater on the grounds of a garden once owned by <PERSON> Pu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yi </PERSON>'s relatives. While a band played Chinese tunes on traditional stringed instruments and dancers performed on a low stage, Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> table-hopped, thanking the guests for coming. `` She has n't changed,'' said He <PERSON> Liliang </PERSON>, who met the Bushes in 1971 when her husband, <PERSON> Huang </PERSON> <PERSON> Hua </PERSON>, became <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s first ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. `` She is still so energetic and warm.'' The gardens and theater, which once belonged to <PERSON> Pu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yi </PERSON>'s great uncle, <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Gong </PERSON>, served as a police barracks for many years, then were restored and opened to the public last year. Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said later that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> was more Westernized now than when she lived here, `` but that's part of growing.'' The 13 months the Bushes lived in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> `` was a very happy time in our lives and we feel lucky to be able to be back again,'' she said.

<HEAD>Don't Ignore Obvious Differences In Rearing Unbiased Child, Experts
Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In a guide for rearing an unbiased child, a group of educators says the place to start is with a 2-year-old just beginning to notice that people come in different shapes, colors and sexes. The advice continues: Do n't assume simple exposure to diversity is enough to kill the seeds of prejudice, but, on the other hand, do n't pretend such differences do not exist. The 65,000-member <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> group </ORGANIZATION> says teachers and parents likewise should not pretend that differences do n't matter but rather explore them fully through discussion, stories, books, games and multiracial `` persona'' dolls with a range of physical characteristics and disabilities. `` Those people who say ` I do n't notice if a person is brown or green or purple' exemplify the colorblind approach,'' says <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Derman-Sparks </PERSON>. `` It arose as the progressive approach against racial bigotry, but it does n't work.'' <PERSON> Derman-Sparks </PERSON>, author of the teacher guidebook and a professor of early childhood development at <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oaks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, recommends discussing with children the differences they see and the ways people are the same and different. `` Talking about differences does n't encourage prejudice,'' she says. `` In fact, responding positively can discourage it. It is a lack of response, or a negative one, that can promote bias.'' Most attempts to teach tolerance and understanding are aimed at older students. But in `` Anti-Bias Curriculum,'' <PERSON> Derman-Sparks </PERSON> cites research findings that by age 4, children to a large extent have internalized gender stereotypes, racial bias and fear of disabled people. Thus her focus on toddlers, preschoolers and kindergarteners. `` Pre-prejudice'' can appear as early as age 2 when a child runs away from a classmate in a leg brace or refuses to hold a black child's hand, insisting it is `` dirty,'' according to the manual. It says such children need special attention to overcome their fears and misconceptions. Teachers are admonished not to ignore or try to excuse discriminatory behavior. If children insult or exclude one another on the basis of race, sex, handicap or ethnic origin, the manual advises, immediately intervene to explain, comfort and set firm standards of acceptable behavior. One of the thorniest problems addressed in the teachers' guide is what to do when parents transmit racist or sexist messages to their children. Among the examples given: A parent says she does n't want her child sitting next to any Mexican kids or a white parent says he does n't want his daughter playing with a black doll because that will lead to interracial dating and marriage. The easiest response, says <PERSON> Derman-Sparks </PERSON>, is to simply say all children in the classroom sit with everyone and children can play with any doll they want. But `` the easiest approach is ultimately the least effective'' because parents do n't change and kids receive mixed messages, she says. The best but admittedly risky way to handle such a situation is to try to talk to the parents about their fears and prejudices, according to the manual. If no agreement is reached, it recommends calling a parents meeting and airing all points of view before making a decision on which if any anti-bias activities to curtail. A companion parents' brochure, available free from the association, describes in detail how to respond to a young child's sometimes awkward questions When asked, `` Why is that girl in a wheelchair?'' a parent should reply: `` She's using a wheelchair because her legs are not strong enough to walk. The wheelchair helps her move around.'' Inappropriate responses would be `` Shh, it's not nice to ask'' or `` I'll tell you another time.'' The brochure says such responses do not satisfy a child's curiosity or teach him or her how to interact comfortably with a disabled person, the brochure says. A parent asked `` Why is <PERSON> Jamal </PERSON>'s skin so dark?'' should not merely answer that `` his skin color does n't matter. We are all the same underneath.'' Rather, toddlers should be told that `` <PERSON> Jamal </PERSON>'s skin is dark brown because his mom and dad have dark brown skin'' and preschoolers given a simple explanation of melanin, the substance that determines skin color in humans. Teachers are given similar guidance. In one example, a student-teacher tells a boy in a swing, `` What wonderful, big circles you are making.'' To a girl in the next swing, she says, `` Be careful, you might hurt yourself.'' The teacher then steps in, saying `` I think <PERSON> Pam </PERSON> is making wonderful, big circles, too.''

 Two moderate earthquakes rattled <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> on Sunday morning, causing minor damage to an airport tower and cracking the pavement on some rural roads, officials said. Red Cross officials said they had no reports of injuries. The first temblor occurred at 6:23 a.m. and measured 4.3 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale, the seismological institute at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> said. The second quake struck at 8:40 a.m. and measured 3.9 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale. The quakes were centered near <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marcos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tarrazu </LOCATION>, a town 45 miles southwest of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, according to institute spokesman <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Barquero </PERSON>. They were felt throughout <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>. He said the temblors cracked the walls of the tower at the <ORGANIZATION> Tobias </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bolanos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION>, a general aviation facility two miles from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, and the pavement of some rural roads. Airport Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> said damage to the tower was minor and it would probably be reopened within hours. He and <PERSON> Barquero </PERSON> spoke to The Associated Press by telephone. An earthquake of 4 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale can cause moderate damage and a quake measuring 5 can cause considerable damage. The <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale is a measure of the energy released by an earthquake as measured by ground motion monitored on a seismograph.

<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Nearly all of <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s doctors stopped working Sunday and said they will resign in a week unless the government improves conditions to end shortages of basic medical supplies. `` Many people have died due to the lack of soluble insulin in the hospitals. Blankets are torn up and used instead of medical cotton. How can we work in such conditions?'' said <PERSON> Abdul-Rahman </PERSON> <PERSON> Abul-Kul </PERSON>, chief of the Physicians' Association of <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>. He led 1,000 of the striking physicians on a march through <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION>, the capital, to present resignations of 2,761 doctors at the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>. He said they represent 98.3 of the nation's doctors The strike comes as Prime Minister <PERSON> Sadek </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON>'s government tries to meet ultimatums of rebellious military officers and the capital is inundated with refugees from the southern civil war. Many refugees are starving and others need medical attention. The physicians said they are protesting shortages of medical supplies such as disposable syringes, antibiotics and life-saving medication like the insulin needed to treat high blood sugar levels. `` We will not withdraw the resignation until we make sure that the implementation of our demands has started,'' <PERSON> Abul-Kul </PERSON> told reporters. He said limited voluntary work would continue and that private clinics would be open two hours a day. <PERSON> Abul-Kul </PERSON> said this East African country needs to spend at least $ 24 million to upgrade health conditions. `` This is only for the next six months, not in the long run,'' he added. `` No one can deny the deterioration of the medical services,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamid </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Sayed </PERSON> <PERSON> Osman </PERSON>, an undersecretary of health and a physician. He said he too would resign if there were no improvements. <PERSON> Osman </PERSON> said the government has allocated $ 25 million for medication, but he could not explain why there were terrible shortages. Refugees fleeing the civil war in the south to government-controlled towns apparently have aggravated the need for medical supplies and hospital care, though <PERSON> Abul-Kul </PERSON> said his association has been demanding improvements in health care since August 1987. The rebel <ORGANIZATION> Sudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> took up arms in 1983 against the Moslem-dominated government to fight for economic and social reforms in the mainly Christian and animist south. On Friday, <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> bowed to army demands and promised to seek peace with the rebels, address domestic problems and change his Cabinet and foreign policy. About 150 army officers led by military commander Gen. <PERSON> Fathi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> put the ultimatum to <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON>. The officers insist there is no threat of a military takeover.

 It was n't like the `` French Connection'' heroin bust. There was no careening car chase, no colorful `` Popeye'' <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON> cracking the case. But agents who smashed a <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong-to-Chinatown </LOCATION> narcotics ring last week stumbled onto the largest heroin haul in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history when they seized $ 1 billion worth of the drug packed in hollowed-out golf cart tires. `` This seizure is much bigger than the ` French Connection,''' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON>, who prosecuted some of the cases stemming from the drug ring that inspired the Oscar-winning 1971 film. `` The biggest seizure from the whole ` French Connection' was about 220 pounds. But this _ everybody was amazed by the size of this seizure.'' Federal authorities on the night of Feb. 20 hit three locations in the borough of <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION>, grabbing 828 pounds of 90 percent pure heroin from <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> _ enough to supply one out of every five <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> heroin addicts for a year. The amount of heroin was so big that when Assistant <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> arrived at his office Tuesday morning, he cautiously asked if a radio report he had heard was correct: Had 300 pounds of heroin really been seized? `` No,'' replied a colleague, with a straight face. `` It was 828 pounds.'' `` We did n't know if we were going to get just a couple of pounds -LRB- of heroin -RRB- or what when we went in,'' <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> said three days later. `` What a way to start the week.'' Eighteen suspects were arrested in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and 13 in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. Seized along with the drugs was $ 3 million cash. <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>, putting the seizure in perspective, said the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> had taken in just over 500 pounds of heroin in all of 1988. The celebrated Pizza Connection case, in which heroin was distributed nationwide through pizzerias, produced 18 convictions but no major drug seizure. Operation White Mare _ named for the heroin's color and its street name, `` horse'' _ started with an informant's tip that <LOCATION> Chinatown </LOCATION> businessman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Woo </PERSON>, one of the 31 people arrested, was involved in drug trafficking, court papers indicated. When the probe ended 18 months later, more than 100 law enforcement officials were involved and the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> had taped more than 100 conversations between <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. `` Unlike the French Connection, this was a whole new culture we were dealing with,'' said <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON>. `` We had hours and hours of conversations in part Chinese, part English, different dialects.'' As a result, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> combed its offices across the country for Chinese-speaking agents to translate the wiretaps. Complicating the language barrier was a code used by the alleged dealers: Heroin was called `` shrimp'' or `` vegetables,'' for example. `` They were very careful in their use of the telephone,'' said <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>. `` The times they used the phone, they were very conscious of what they said.'' But there were tip-offs that the end was near for the suspects, who are accused of shipping drugs from <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>'s `` Golden Triangle'' via <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, where the heroin was trucked across the country. Wiretaps indicated that Woo, 71, a prominent businessman in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Chinatown </LOCATION>, believed he was under surveillance; two other busts of the operation turned up 183 pounds of heroin in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and more than 100 pounds in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` This guy <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Woo </PERSON> is hurting,'' said <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>. `` His friends are out all the heroin, plus the money. I think his people are going to be kind of upset, do n't you?'' While a bust of this size will hurt the heroin trade, <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON> acknowledged it was no death blow. `` We're making heavy dents, but there's always somebody waiting to step in and take over,'' said <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON>. `` They keep spitting it out as fast as we make seizures.'' Which means this record-setting bust will someday be surpassed? `` I hate to say no. I guess you have to assume there always a bigger fish in the lake,'' said <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>. `` But I think it's going to be a long time before that happens.''

 This Bold <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> is raising a stink in an attempt to shed its reputation as one of the smelliest places in the nation. Paper mills produce odor, and chemical companies use a smelly byproduct from the mills, terpene, to produce flavorings and perfumes. `` The combination creates an odor which sometimes is totally unbearable,'' said <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Shorstein </PERSON>, deputy chief administrative officer in Mayor <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazouri </PERSON>'s office. When <PERSON> Hazouri </PERSON> took office in 1987, he pledged an odor-free city within two years. Although officials say he may have been overly optimistic, they say conditions have improved, particularly since the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> last March passed a toughened anti-odor bill. Under it, the city has negotiated with companies about reducing their emissions. It's even fined its own sewer plant. Not everyone in this north <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> city of 600,000 agrees about the extent of the problem. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> SCM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Glidco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, one of the companies that has run afoul of the anti-odor campaign, conceded that part of <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>'s reputation as a smelly city is earned. But, he said, `` part of that is cities competing with <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> for growth could n't find much else to be negative about. Frankly, <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>'s got a lot going for it.'' He called the odor issue a `` cosmetic personal preference problem,'' saying the more important problem is health hazards in the air such as ozone. Countered Ms. <PERSON> Shorstein </PERSON>: `` We have people who have been driven inside by the odors to the point they are not even capable of opening their doors or going into their back yard.'' <PERSON> Homeowner </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Oster </PERSON> put it more bluntly last year, about the time the new anti-stink law was passed: `` I'll tell you exactly what the air smells like. It's like being locked in a Port-O-Let at the county fair. There's no escape.'' There were 4,200 odor complaints last year, up from 2,165 in 1987, before the new ordinance was passed. `` I do n't think that says that odors got worse,'' <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON> said. `` There's a heightened public awareness. Contrary to what the number of complaint says, I think things are getting better.'' <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON> also pointed out that more than half of last year's complaints were not about the paper mills and chemical companies In fact, <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON> said, the city's sewage plant got more complaints than his company. The city recently fined the sewage plant $ 28,357. As for <ORGANIZATION> SCM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Glidco </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON> said the company has spent $ 1.5 million to $ 2 million on odor reduction, changing equipment and procedures at the plant. <ORGANIZATION> SCM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Glidco </ORGANIZATION> is one of several companies negotiating with the city over their efforts to come into compliance with the law. Under the civil section of the ordinance, the city can impose fines of up to $ 10,000 per day per violation and can order corrections of problems if negotiations fail. The law's criminal sanctions were recently thrown out by a judge as unconstitutionally vague. People can report objectionable odors by calling a 24-hour hotline. If a company receives five complaints within a 90-day period, it can be cited. <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON> said the city needs to establish objective standards to what is malodorous. For now, an odor is deemed objectionable if someone complains. `` All we need is somebody tell us that these compounds and these concentrations are by legal definition malodorous, and you emit them we're going to get you,'' he said. `` We've had complaints about emitting sweet-smelling odor.'' Many view the odor as the price of having industries that provide jobs. Ms. <PERSON> Shorstein </PERSON> sees it from a different perspective. `` It's hard to attract the kind of businesses we are looking for when someone flies into this community and at 4,000 feet they are smelling the odor,'' she said.

 Afghan guerrillas claimed Sunday that nearly 11,000 Afghan troops have joined the resistance and surrendered large quantities of weapons during recent fighting around <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Radio <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> said Sunday that five civilians died Saturday in a guerrilla rocket attack on the eastern city of <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> and that another civilian died in a similar attack in northeastern <LOCATION> Laghman </LOCATION> province. The guerrilla-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Afghan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said 68 Afghan soldiers were killed and about 90 wounded in fighting around <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> since Tuesday. And the Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said Afghan soldiers killed 97 guerrillas and captured two major ammunition depots in fighting Saturday. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the Afghan <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement criticizing the Moslem guerrillas for forming a government-in-exile in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, where they are based, and for predicting they will soon take power in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The statement, the first official Afghan reaction to the interim government, said it violated the U.N.-mediated accord that led the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to withdraw its 115,000 troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> also quoted the Soviet newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> as saying the guerrillas plan to attack <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> in a bid to topple the Moscow-backed regime of President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>. It said they also plan to attack <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> and hope to install their government there. None of the reports could be confirmed independently. If the Afghan military defections are confirmed, they would be the largest reported in the war between the U.S.-backed guerrillas and the communist regime in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. The Afghan army is estimated to have 50,000 soldiers. A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Jamiat-i-Islami </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla group said Sunday that three Afghan regiments, or more than 10,000 men, defected to the insurgents in northern <LOCATION> Takhar </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Badakhshan </LOCATION> provinces on Feb. 16, the day after Soviet troops ended nine years of military involvement in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The Afghan soldiers surrendered 10,000 weapons and 90 military vehicles, spokesman <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Shoaib </PERSON> said from his headquarters in <LOCATION> Peshawar </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ismail </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON>, a Jamiat field commander, claimed 600 Afghan soldiers defected Feb. 18 from the garrison town of <LOCATION> Rubat </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sangi </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Herat </LOCATION>, the western provincial capital. Statements by <PERSON> Jamiat </PERSON>, one of the most powerful rebel military groups, have generally proved reliable. The Afghan News Agency of the rival <ORGANIZATION> Hezb-i-Islami </ORGANIZATION> rebel group said another 101 government soldiers surrendured during a guerrilla attack Wednesday near <LOCATION> Mazar-i-Sharif </LOCATION>, the capital of northern <LOCATION> Balkh </LOCATION> province. Earlier this month, a council of Afghan guerrilla leaders met in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and formed a government-in-exile. They called on foreign countries to recognize the proposed government, which hopes to take over if <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> is overthrown. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> quoted the Afghan <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> as saying the interim government was formed `` under the direct pressure of Pakistani secret services and their imperialist patrons in violation of the U.N. charter.'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the ministry `` described this move as an interference in domestic affairs of the sovereign and non-aligned state.'' <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s major cities are under siege by the guerrillas, who reportedly control 90 percent of the countryside. Guerrilla field commanders have said they oppose major offensives on urban areas that would result in high civilian casualties.

 Tearful Armenians laid flowers before pictures of their dead brethren Sunday to mark the anniversary of three days of ethnic rioting that killed at least 32 people a year ago and galvanized a nationalist movement. `` Events have shown that we ca n't automatically trust the authorities. The time for automatic trust has passed,'' activist <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gevandov </PERSON> told a crowd of several hundred gathered at the steps of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s Armenian church. Authorities sanctioned the gathering, held to commemorate rioting in the Azerbaijani city of <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION> on Feb. 28-29 and March 1 last year. Speaker <PERSON> Arkady </PERSON> <PERSON> Semyonov </PERSON> called them `` three black and unforgettable days.'' Soviet officials say 26 Armenians and six <PERSON> Azerbaijanis </PERSON> died in the violence, but Armenians insist the toll was much higher. Photocopies of pictures of victims and their death certificates were displayed on a wall of the brick church. Armenians laid lilies, red carnations and tulips before the pictures and raised candles as funeral music played. Banners raised at the gathering demanded that political leaders of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, a republic neighboring <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s southern <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> region, be found responsible for the rioting, and that Soviet authorities denounce the violence Speakers criticized the Soviet press for what they said was an unfair characterization of Armenians as extremists. A resolution called for authorities to recognize the rioting as an act of genocide, construct a monument to the victims in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and release members of the activist <ORGANIZATION> Karabakh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION> riots broke out several weeks after thousands of Armenians staged protests demanding annexation of the <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> region of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> is populated predominantly by ethnic Armenians, and they consider it to be historically a part of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, even though Soviet officials turned it over to <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> in the 1920s. <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> authorities have rejected the annexation demands. Most Azerbaijanis are Moslem and most Armenians are <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION>. But Father Tiran Gureghian of the Armenian church in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> told the crowd, `` The problem is not religious, not political, but purely national and territorial.'' <PERSON> Almaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Yestekov </PERSON>, one of the founders of Islam and Democracy, a new movement in the traditionally Moslem republics of <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, appealed for understanding between Armenians and Azerbaijanis. He said he had appealed to Azerbaijanis for calm in an interview with foreign radio stations. `` We are children of the same tribe, roots of the same tree,'' <PERSON> Yestekov </PERSON> said. After the deadly riots in February, ethnic unrest erupted into violence again in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> in June, July and November. More than 60 people were killed, and in January the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> imposed direct rule over <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>. Under the direct rule, the region's local legislature was dissolved and a special commission was given the power to suspend all local governing councils and administrative bodies, any informal organizations, and oversee the media, health and education. The Armenian protests began as an appeal to President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> for annexation and were fueled by his reform policies. When <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> authorities rejected the appeals, the movement grew to incorporate economic, cultural and environmental grievances. Some activists called for outright independence for <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. When <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> visited <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> following the Dec. 7 earthquake there that killed 25,000 people, authorities began rounding up members of the <ORGANIZATION> Karabakh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> who had been among the organizers of large demonstrations and general strikes. <PERSON> Gevandov </PERSON> said the events showed authorities were incapable of controlling crowds motivated by anything other than slogans they themselves place before the people. `` It is impossible to build a national structure without the cement of truth and sincerity,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 The Democratic chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> committee told the nation's governors Sunday that `` we're fresh out of cash here in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'' and warned them there is more fiscal pain ahead for the states. Sen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> disclaimed any intention to `` launch an assault'' on President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> or his budget, but added that the White House was following `` a most unorthodox approach'' to the deficit negotiations. <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON> was the principal speaker at the opening session of the midwinter meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The administration was not represented at the session because <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> budget director, declined an invitation to appear. `` All the governors understand we have to take our fair share of cuts to deal with deficit reduction and we've done that,'' said Democratic Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. But he went on to say that the states were hard pressed to deal with new obligations mandated by the federal government without funds to pay for them. `` We ca n't take continued mandated automatic expenditures,'' he said. Gov. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Baliles </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, a Democratic who is <ORGANIZATION> NGA </ORGANIZATION> chairman, opened the session by pointing out that the federal budget item for interest on the debt `` now exceeds spending on all domestic discretionary programs.'' <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON> disputed some of the economic assumptions made by the new administration, particularly the forecast that interest rates will decline to 5.5 percent in 1990. <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON> said that while the administration predicts a balanced budget by 1993, the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> forecasts a $ 75 billion deficit for the same year. <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON>, a former member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, said he was confused by the process being used to reach a budget agreement. `` We're confused ourselves this year,'' said <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON>. `` This is a most unorthodox approach.'' The <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> senator said the administration had simply left many budget areas blank and left it to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to suggest where cuts ought to be made. `` It's a little like you going to your state legislatures with your budget and just taking about half of it and throwing it up in the air and saying, <LOCATION> OK </LOCATION>, fellow, here it is, you solve it.'' He said that in his negotiations with <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> `` we sort of shadow box around on this program and that program. ... It's a very unusual budget process.'' <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON> said that while <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is asking for a line-item veto, a budgetary tool that many governors have, `` he refuses to offer the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> this year, a line-item budget.'' `` The sad reality of our fiscal circumstances is that there's substantial pain to be portioned out to the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people and I'm sorry to say that the portion of that pain likely to fall to state and local government is, once again, very substantial,'' said

<TEXT>
 The opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is more popular than the governing <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> for the first time since October 1986, according to an opinion poll published in the Observer newspaper Sunday. The Harris poll suggests Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s Conservatives have fallen six points in the last month to 41 percent, while <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> has improved five points to 42 percent, its highest level since before the 1983 general election A Gallup Poll published in The Sunday Telegraph has Labor, under leader <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON>, even with the Conservatives, each with 35 percent. Both the independent Observer and the conservative Sunday Telegraph suggested Labor's gains were at the Conservatives' expense. Both polls indicated support for the centrist <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> was holding steady at 10 percent. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said support for the splinter <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> was little changed at 3 percent, and <PERSON> Gallup </PERSON> said it was 4 percent. The newspapers said dissatisfaction with the government has probably resulted from its proposed radical overhaul of the mostly free <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, high inflation, interest rates and mortgage rates, and plans to privatize the country's water industry. On Saturday, thousands of young people rallied in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> in a generally peaceful protest of government plans to freeze financial aid for university students and institute a system of loans. The marchers, estimated by police at 8,000, grouped on the <ORGANIZATION> Victoria </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embankment </ORGANIZATION> beside the <LOCATION> Thames </LOCATION> in central <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, then made their way past <ORGANIZATION> Whitehall </ORGANIZATION>'s government office buildings and across <LOCATION> Lambeth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> to the south bank of the Thames and a rally in <LOCATION> Kensington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>. The route was heavily policed because a similar demonstration in November ended in battles between officers and students. Beginning in 1990, the government plans to freeze the existing student grants and introduce student loans to make up the growing gap between the grants and actual costs. Details of the plans have not been announced. The <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> poll of 1,027 Britons was conducted Wednesday and Thursday, before the results were known of two special elections for vacant parliamentary seats. No margin of error was given. The <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> narrowly retained one of its safest parliamentary seats, the wealthy <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> district in northern <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, although its majority tumbled Thursday from nearly 20,000 votes to 2,600. Labor kept its seat at <LOCATION> Pontypridd </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION>. The Sunday Telegraph did not provide Gallup's sample size or margin of error and did not say when the survey was conducted.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s latest government, headed by Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Prosper </PERSON> <PERSON> Avril </PERSON>, has continued the human rights abuses of its predecessors, three human rights organizations charged Sunday. `` The persistence of serious human rights violations suggests an ongoing refusal by the military to relinquish power to an elected civilian government,'' the groups' report said. The 159-page report, issued by <LOCATION> Americas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Watch </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Haitian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refugees </ORGANIZATION>, and <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rights </LOCATION>, noted that <PERSON> Avril </PERSON>'s 5-month-old government has vowed to hold elections and promote human rights. But it said peasant organizations, trade unions and church activists are still subject to military and paramilitary violence, and that `` demonstrations and outspoken critics are also regularly targeted.'' The Avril government has never prosecuted those involved in political violence, it added. It also said that the government, rather than establishing an independent electoral council, has proposed a procedure for selecting a new electoral commission `` that would be highly susceptible to military control.'' Since the report was compiled, <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> has agreed to set up an independent electoral council, as recommended by a forum of political and civic leaders. In a decree Thursday, the government said the council would organize and set a date for elections and supervise the vote. <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> assumed the presidency Sept. 17 in a coup led by rank-and-file soldiers demanding democratic reforms. The coup ousted Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>, whose rule saw widespread repression, including mass killings. The three human rights groups said their report was based on seven missions to <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> since November 1987. <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> has been racked by political strife for decades, particularly during the reign of President-for-Life <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> `` Papa Doc'' <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON>, who died in 1971; and his son, <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> `` Baby Doc'' <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON>, who was ousted in a coup three years ago.

 While Czechoslovak playwright <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> is confined to a <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> jail, authorities in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> are not only allowing performances of his plays, but the prime minister showed up for the opening. Prime Minister <PERSON> Mieczyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON>'s appearance at the theater Saturday illustrates the different paths the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc countries are taking in confronting their critics. While <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader, <PERSON> Milos </PERSON> <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON>, has chosen to crack down on dissent, <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON>'s government has started negotiations on political and economic reforms with the opposition it once tried to crush. Many Western countries have criticized the Feb. 21 decision of a <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> court to sentence <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> to nine months in jail on charges of inciting citizens to take part in a banned demonstration last month and obstructing police officers. But nowhere in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc has <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>'s jailing aroused such interest among officials and anger among independent intellectuals as in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. Even the decision to allow the performance of the highly political and critical works is a reversal of the authorities' attitude toward <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>, whose works have been published here only in the underground press <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>'s plays first were staged in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in late 1981, but production was suspended after only 12 performances when authorities imposed martial law that December to suppress the independent Solidarity trade union movement. Filmmaker <PERSON> Feliks </PERSON> <PERSON> Falk </PERSON>, who directed the current production of two one-act <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> plays, `` The Audience'' the `` The Protest,'' said he has tried for a long time to get permission to stage the plays. The cast began rehearsing in January and <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> originally was invited to the premiere, he said. `` It's just a coincidence that <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> is in prison,'' <PERSON> Falk </PERSON> said in an interview. `` For us and for the actors, of course, the performance is very important because of <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>, and because the plays are very good.'' <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON>'s appearance added a dramatic twist to the performance of the two one-act plays. Assistant theater director <PERSON> Krzysztof </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudzinski </PERSON> blanched and tried to stop a young activist from selling underground copies of `` Thriller,'' a collection of <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>'s political essays, in the theater lobby. <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> witnessed the scene as he arrived. But the prime minister ignored the fuss and calmly took a regular seat in the theater, five rows away from <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Michnik </PERSON>, a leading Polish opposition theorist who like <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> has spent years in jail for his writings and political activities. For two hours the audience was spellbound, first by `` The Audience,'' the tale of a simple brewery worker being pressured by police to inform on a writer whom authorities have forced to work in the brewery as punishment for his political activities. `` It shows the drama of the average man,'' historian <PERSON> Bronislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Geremek </PERSON> said during intermission. But it was `` The Protest'' that particularly touched the audience of officials and intellectuals. The story concerns the behavior of an official writer who appeals to an opposition writer to arrange a petition against the detention of a musician involved with his daughter. But the writer balks when asked to sign the protest the opposition already had formulated. As the crowd applauded at the end of the play, <PERSON> Michnik </PERSON> jumped on stage to read a personal hand-written appeal to Czech authorities to release <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>. But his protest was drowned by music blaring through loudspeakers. <PERSON> Michnik </PERSON> has met <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> several times at clandestine meetings of Polish and Czechoslovak political activists in the mountains along the border that separates the two countries. He called <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> a friend and symbol like Nobel Peace Prize winners <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> He urged `` competent authorities to stop repression'' and urged the Czechoslovak leadership `` to take the same road as other East European countries are taking _ reconciliation with the nation.'' <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> was arrested Jan. 16 during an attempt with other opposition activists to lay flowers in memory of <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Palach </PERSON>, a student who burned himself to death 20 years ago to protest the 1968 Soviet-led invasion of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. Polish opposition groups quickly rose to his defense. The national leadership of Solidarity; the independent <ORGANIZATION> Polish-Czech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Solidarity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>; and the Polish chapter of the international writers' P.E.N. Club all have appealed to authorities to release <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>. The Polish government declined to comment on his jailing, saying it was an internal affair of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>.

Zoo officials hope Vip, 9, and <PERSON> Gigi </PERSON>, 16, will produce a family of lowland gorillas to inhabit a new $ 26 million facility at a revitalized <LOCATION> Franklin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zoo </LOCATION>, which once ranked among the 10 worst zoos in the nation. Vip and <PERSON> Gigi </PERSON> are due to make their first public appearance as a couple in their temporary digs at the <ORGANIZATION> Stone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zoo </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Stoneham </LOCATION> on Monday, but the two have been warming up to each other during about a half-dozen introductory meetings over the last week. Both gorillas have spent their entire lives in captivity. They were matched by the species survival program of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zoological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parks </ORGANIZATION> and Aquariums, which traced their family trees to make sure they were not closely related. After an initial get-acquainted period of slamming walls with their fists, the two 250-pound gorillas began chasing each other in circles, and each chase ended with the two resting closer and closer together. Behaviorist <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Shildkraudt </PERSON> said the reaction was natural. The gorillas were just learning to relinquish the personal space many wild beasts demand.

<TEXT>
 More than 10,000 demonstrators marched through central <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> on Sunday to protest British Rail's proposed high-speed rail routes linking <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> with the <LOCATION> Channel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tunnel </LOCATION>, organizers and police said. Residents representing almost every southeast <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> town and village that could be affected by the project joined the mass protest, the first demonstration against all four of <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rail </ORGANIZATION>'s proposed routes `` This march is unique because it is not political,'' said <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Channel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Residents </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> Executive which organized the march. `` We are of all colors. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> has got to listen to us.'' People who live near the proposed routes say the rail link will hurt the environment, be a noisy eyesore and lower property values. A jazz band led the three-mile parade to Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s 10 Downing St. residence, where organizers left a protest scroll, a tape recording of children singing a protest song and a bunch of flowers which they said represented the environment that could be harmed. `` We do n't want it, no one wants it,'' chanted one group. <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> Yard said the march was peaceful. Although the individual groups oppose the four rail links for a variety of reasons, they all want more consultations and more consideration of the environmental impact before <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rail </ORGANIZATION> selects a route. British Rail is expected to announce in early March which route it prefers for the trains, which will run at up to 180 mph. The trains will link up with the <LOCATION> Channel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tunnel </LOCATION>, the 34-mile tunnel being bored under the English Channel simultaneously from <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. It is expected to be completed in 1993.

<HEAD>Crippled Ecuadoran Orphan Learns New Way of Life With Adoptive Family</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WALTHAM, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two years ago, <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> lived in a remote Ecuadoran orphanage where she owned two dresses, ate soup every night and crawled around, dragging her two crippled legs behind her. These days, <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> is an active second-grader at an elementary school just outside <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. She celebrated her ninth birthday last week in the home she shares with <PERSON> James </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Kidd </PERSON>, who have cared for her since September 1987 and plan to adopt her. It is a far cry from how she began life. Shortly after birth, <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> was rescued by nuns who spotted her just as her parents were about to throw her in a bonfire because of her deformities. She was brought to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> in May 1987 for leg surgery under the sponsorship of <LOCATION> Por </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cristo </LOCATION>, a Brockton-based charity organization. The Kidds took her in after reading about her in a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> newspaper. Her legs were amputated and she was fitted with prostheses. She defied doctors who doubted she would ever walk by taking her first steps shortly after getting her artificial legs. <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> said she was `` scared'' when the director of the orphanage told her she was going to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` I cried,'' she said. `` I did n't want to go.'' Now, <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> said, she has nightmares about returning to the orphanage high in the Andes, where she slept in a room filled with other children and never celebrated a birthday. She is fluent in English and has a roomful of toys and stuffed animals _ many of them elephants because the Kidds are active in the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. She has a best friend, <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON>, at school, and her favorite class is spelling. She watches the `` The Brady Bunch'' on TV every afternoon. She walks easily on two prosthetic legs with the aid of a single crutch and is beginning to take steps without it. In fact the only clue to <PERSON> Maria </PERSON>'s past is her diet. Chicken. `` She eats it for almost every single meal,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Kidd </PERSON>, 33, a kindergarten teacher. `` I feel like asking <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Perdue </PERSON> if he wants to use her as a poster child. It's all she wants to eat.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Kidd </PERSON> said she discovered that children in the orphanage were allowed chicken only on special holidays once or twice a year. When she was first brought to Children's Hospital in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, doctors were unsure if they could do anything except strengthen her legs. She was born with severe scoliosis, or curvature of the spine. But <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> proved strong enough for doctors to decide to amputate her legs and fit her with new ones. <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> is still learning to walk without crutches. She was up to 25 steps without crutches when she returned to the hospital last summer for spinal fusion surgery. She spent five months in a body cast and wheelchair. Her new goals, she said, are to learn to ice skate and ski. But she said she is still enjoying life with the <ORGANIZATION> Kidds </ORGANIZATION>. `` I always wanted a family,'' <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> said. `` At the orphanage, there was one girl who had -LRB- relatives -RRB- visit her and I was jealous.'' But when asked to describe the very best thing about her new life, <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> was succinct. `` Chicken,'' she said.

 A plane returning from a supply run to the U.S.-backed <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> rebels slammed into a hillside, killing all 10 people on board, aviation officials said Sunday., The DC-6 crashed at about 2:30 p.m. Saturday near <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigra </ORGANIZATION>, a village seven miles northeast of <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION>, said Capt <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Aguilera </PERSON>, head of operations for <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION>. Officials did not release any information on the crash until Sunday. They said the victims were all employees of a local firm that has a contract to deliver supplies to the rebel camps. `` Our company rents planes to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- AID -RRB- to transport supplies to the Contras,'' said <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Molina </PERSON>, one of the proprietors of Circle G <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. He said the plane had delivered more than 15 tons of clothes, food and medicine to <LOCATION> Bocay </LOCATION>, a town near the Contra camps in northeastern <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, and was on its way home when it crashed. Bocay is about 250 miles from the capital. He and <PERSON> Aguilera </PERSON> spoke to The Associated Press in telephone interviews. <PERSON> Aguilera </PERSON> said high winds and turbulence may have been a factor in the crash. The plane slammed into a hillside when it began its approach to <LOCATION> Toncontin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION>, he said. `` All the occupants of the plane died in the accident,'' <PERSON> Molina </PERSON> said. `` Radar at the airport control tower -LRB- in <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION> -RRB- lost track of the aircraft at about 2:32 p.m. The crew never reported any problems.'' He identified the crew as pilot <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> <PERSON> Molina </PERSON>, co-pilot <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Caceres </PERSON> and engineer <PERSON> Wilfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>. He said the passengers were also employees of Circle G. `` Their bodies were recovered today at midday and will be brought to the capital by a <ORGANIZATION> Honduran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> helicopter even though it will be diffcult because the site of the crash is inaccessible,'' <PERSON> Aguilera </PERSON> said. About 11,000 Contra rebels and their families have been holed up in base camps in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> near the Nicaraguan border for the last 10 months. They have not received overt <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid in a year, but humanitarian aid continues.

 <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>' three Democrats in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> are divided two against one in a feud about party loyalty, political philosophy and personalities. Rep. <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>'s bashing of his national party raises <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> hopes that the tough-talking former sheriff might change party affiliations Their words have been so heated that the state's <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader called Saturday for <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> and fellow Reps. <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> to sit down and work out their differences. But there are apparently no prospects for peace between the conservative, outspoken <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> and his two colleagues, whom he labels as too liberal to represent <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> is scheduled to get a personal pitch to switch to the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> this week, when he meets Tuesday afternoon with Sen. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, who defected from the Democrats six years ago. As of last week, <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said that he was still a Democrat, but, `` I can foresee the day when people will be jumping ship right and left.'' He had strong criticism for his colleagues. `` I do n't care what those liberals do in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, I vote the convictions of my constituents here,'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> told a chamber of commerce banquet Friday night in <LOCATION> Bald </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Knob </LOCATION>, about 50 miles northeast of here. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> are `` two pigs squealing because they have been stuck and do n't like it,'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> `` Skip'' <PERSON> Rutherford </PERSON> said the congressmen `` have some personal differences that need to be resolved.'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, a thrird-term congressman, fell out with <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> when the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> denied him a seat last month on the Education and <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> of the House. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said the vote was his punishment for appearing last November on radio ads supporting fellow <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>., who was defeated by Democrat <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Sangmeister </PERSON> <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON>, an ex officio member of the steering committee, chairs the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which raises money for House Democrats. While acknowledging that he told the steering committee about <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>'s efforts on behalf of a Republican, <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> said <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> is responsible for his own problems. `` He is the one who campaigned for a Republican. He was the one who was unloyal,'' said <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> member since 1979. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> has never been a buddy of <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>, who's been in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> since 1969. Among other issues, they have clashed about <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> _ <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> wants to sell <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> rice to <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>, while <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> distrusts the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> leader. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> said last week that <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> has `` ruined himself in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'' because of party disloyalty: `` I do n't know what he does _ just mostly run his mouth.'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> responded: `` The problem with <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> is that they do not understand the <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> meaning of loyalty. To an Arkansan, loyalty is representing the wishes of your constituency. I consider it disloyal to go to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> ... as <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> did.'' Such exchanges trouble <PERSON> Rutherford </PERSON>, who said he would be willing to mediate the flap. During a meeting Friday, <PERSON> Rutherford </PERSON> urged <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> not to switch parties. `` I wanted him to know that, as chairman, I very much wanted him to remain in the party and that we knew he was being heavily recruited by the Republicans, and that there is room here for his views,'' <PERSON> Rutherford </PERSON> said. `` In his own way, he is trying to bring the party back to the center,'' <PERSON> Rutherford </PERSON> said. `` I think there's room to raise legitimate questions. I think you're seeing a lot of political posturing right now, which is very much a part of the process.''

 Sen. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>, R-Tex., seeking to ease what he called the `` human tragedy'' of Central Americans denied political asylum in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, says he will introduce legislation requiring would-be refugees to apply before they enter this country As of last Thursday, about 625 Central Americans who had been denied asylum were under detention in the 315-acre <ORGANIZATION> Port </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Isabel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Processing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> run by the <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> just north of <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. They were awaiting deportation. `` They have the very real human tragedy of having to walk home after spending their worldly goods to get here,'' <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> said. `` It's not humane I want to let them know if they're accepted -LRB- as political refugees -RRB- before they come.'' The Central Americans were detained under a policy that took effect last Dec. 16, denying those who seek polical asylum the right to travel within the country while their applications or appeals are processed. <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>, in an interview Friday, said 98 percent of the Central American refugees who arrive in <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION> are being denied political asylum. `` Having thousands a month come into <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION> creates a huge overload, many bring communicable diseases that we long ago stopped worrying about, they have no housing, and have been a tremendous burden on the local economy,'' <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> said. Under his proposal, refugees from <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> could apply for asylum in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> said he discussed the bill last week with Attorney General <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> and is confident of gaining administration support. <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> said he would introduce the bill Tuesday. Under the new policy, <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> officials are speeding up the review of applications while detaining the applicants. Previously, applications could take weeks to process and aliens were released on their own recognizance while awaited appeals or deportation. As many as 2,000 refugees a week had been crossing the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> into <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, but the number has slowed to a trickle under the new policy. Only immigrants who can prove they have suffered political persecution are entitled to asylum. Those who come for economic reasons are subject to deportation. <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> officials say most Central Americans arriving in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> do not qualify for refugee status.

<HEAD>Vegetable Damage Bad In Central Florida</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The record weekend freeze caused some of the worst crop damage in a decade for central <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> vegetable growers, who supply produce sold across the country, growers and industry officials said. But fields farther south and along the coast fared better in the cold wave that hit Thursday, Friday and Saturday, growers and industry officials said. Temperatures moderated Sunday. With a value to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> farmers of more than $ 1.1 billion annually, produce ranks near the state's agricultural leader, the $ 1.3 billion-a-year citrus industry, which appeared to have suffered only minimal damage. `` From talking with several growers yesterday, we did experience quite a bit of damage on the real cold-sensitive crops _ cucumbers, watermelons and squash _ and some damage on peppers and tomato crops,'' <PERSON> Reggie </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, spokesman for Orlando-based <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vegetable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said Sunday. `` That damage varies quite a bit with the locality,'' he said, adding that the <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area, the northernmost area where crops are in the ground this time of year, was hit the worst. `` Overall, this particular cold, for the most part, has not been one that has wiped out a crop, with the exception of Ruskin-Palmetto -LRB- near <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> -RRB-, but appears to be one that has pushed crops back, with a 25 to 30 percent loss of potential yield,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from his Naples-area home. `` What I see is a disaster,'' <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Harloff </PERSON>, a Palmetto tomato grower and packer, told the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petersburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> in a story published Sunday. Tomatoes are the state's largest produce crop, valued at almost $ 490 million in 1987, the latest figures available from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>. Elsewhere Saturday, <ORGANIZATION> Tampa </ORGANIZATION> hit a record low of 31 degrees, <LOCATION> Daytona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> had a record low of 29, <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> hit a record 30 and <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION> had a record 27. <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION>, in the northern part of the state, had a record low of 18. `` Every cucumber in the state of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> is gone, from what I understand,'' <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Burgin </PERSON>, a produce broker in <LOCATION> Plant </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, told the Times. `` There wo n't be any cucumbers for about 60 days.'' `` I had a fellow with 500 acres of cucumbers and peppers in south Hillsborough -LRB- <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> -RRB- call me this morning to tell me that they're completely gone,'' <PERSON> Burgin </PERSON> said `` And the <PERSON> Ruskin </PERSON> tomato people lost everything. They're completely wiped out.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Ruskin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vegetable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Hillsborough </LOCATION> ships fresh produce to some of the largest grocery store chains and terminal markets in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, including those in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. `` Our main suit is tomatoes,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ruskin </PERSON> <PERSON> Vegetable </PERSON>'s general manager. `` The damage to the tomato crop was considerable. I've seen a lot of kill today. I've seen total loss in some fields, and just a little bit in a few fields because they were close to the -LRB- warming -RRB- water, but I've seen at least some damage in every field, up to total destruction.'' <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> said the damage was the worst in the 10 years that he's worked at <LOCATION> Ruskin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegetable </LOCATION> Ready-to-pick tomato crops in the vast fields of <LOCATION> Collier </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, around <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION>, and southern <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, which includes <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, fared much better, said <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. Ironically, unseasonably warm weather this winter before the cold snap contributed to the losses. Warm, sunny days induced farmers to plant early and rapid growth then made plants especially tender and more vulnerable to the cold.

<HEAD>Parks Chief Says Don't Feed Starving Yellowstone Elk, Bison</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KUGLIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Feeding hay to elk and bison starving in this fire-scarred preserve could do more harm than good, and even if many animals die the herds are in no danger of extinction, says the head of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. The reduction in natural grazing by last summer's drought and huge fires, combined with a severe winter, have driven elk and bison out of the park into southern <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, where the state is allowing hunters to kill hundreds of the animals. The state claims they carry disease that could infect livestock. In the small town of <LOCATION> Gardiner </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, just north of the park, starving elk are eating hay donated by sympathetic people, along with hedges and trees. Small herds of elk and buffalo have congregated in parking lots. `` They are skinny and eak,'' said <PERSON> Trudi </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, who joined with others in town to raise money to feed the animals after one elk died in her yard. She admits the winter will probably claim older animals, but hopes to save younger cows that will soon calve. `` In this town, most of the people make their money off these animals. At least they could give a little back,'' she said, referring to the area's popularity with hunters and tourists. But feeding hay to elk allows diseases to spread among the animals when they gather in tight groups at feeding stations, park service director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Penn </PERSON> <PERSON> Mott </PERSON> said at a news conference Saturday at <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>'s headquarters. And if park rangers started feeding hay to elk in <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>, the expensive practice could go on forever as the animals become dependent on it, as they have at the national elk refuge at <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyo. </LOCATION>, south of <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mott </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mott </PERSON> was sent on a fact-finding trip to <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> by new <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> following national publicity about the hunting in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and high mortality in the park's northern elk herd _ the largest migratory elk herd in the world. <PERSON> Mott </PERSON> said one option he thought he could support was to have the federal government acquire more winter game range north of the park in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Rocky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Missoula </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, announced Friday that it will start a special fund toward expanding winter range for <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>'s elk herd. <PERSON> Mott </PERSON> also said he will ask the <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and other state and federal agencies and conservation groups to help draft a report on <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>'s total wildlife management program, which he called fragmented. `` We will look at the total ecosystem and how to best manage wildlife,'' he said. `` If land is being overgrazed, we should look at this.'' Both elk and bison populations in <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> are near all-time highs because several mild winters before this year allowed more animals to survive than in normal years. Almost 500 of <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>'s 2,700 bison have been shot in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and 250 additional permits have been issued. And more than 2,350 elk from <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>'s northern herd of 19,000 were shot by <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> hunters this winter. Last year, only 39 bison were shot in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>'s hunt Inside Yellowstone, rangers have counted more than 300 elk carcasses. This year's hunting has been denounced as a slaughter by such animal-welfare activists as <ORGANIZATION> Cleveland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amory </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, president of the Fund for Animals. <PERSON> Mott </PERSON> repeated his support for reintroduction of wolves into <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>, not only because wolves could help keep big-game populations in balance, `` but because wolves represent the West and part of biological diversity.'' That proposal is strongly opposed by ranchers outside the park. <PERSON> Mott </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>'s herds are in no danger of extinction, but in some areas visitors may see fewer animals this year. `` Even if winter kill -LRB- of elk -RRB- is 50 percent, there would still be a core that would rapidly reproduce,'' he said. `` Bison have the biological capacity of recovering from low numbers,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Meagher </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> research biologist, noting that the park's bison started from a remnant population of 22 animals. <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> officials said they authorized the bison hunt because about half of <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>'s bison carry the disease brucellosis, which causes domestic cows to abort their calves. But <PERSON> Meagher </PERSON> said her best information from <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>'s state veterinarian was that no cases of brucellosis in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> had ever been traced to Yellowstone animals. She also pointed out that ranchers vaccinate their calves against the disease.

 A bomb exploded at a guard house outside the British Consulate in <LOCATION> Karachi </LOCATION> on Sunday night, killing a <LOCATION> Pakistani </LOCATION> guard, police said. There was an unconfirmed report that another person was injured in the blast, which eyewitnesses said occurred around 9:35 p.m. when the mission was closed. Police quickly cordoned off the posh area of <LOCATION> Clifton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> at the port city's western seaside. Officers, speaking on the usual condition of anonymity, said a guard was killed instantly. They said the blast was almost certainly a bomb but that an investigation was under way. None of the consulate staff was believed to be inside the building when the blast occurred. Witnesses said another person was injured, but police could not confirm that. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the explosion, but Moslems here have been protesting British writer <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s novel, `` The Satanic Verses.'' Six people died and almost 100 were injured when a mob attacked an American cultural center Feb. 12 in the Pakistani capital of <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> to demand that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> ban the book. The novel, which some say insults Islam, has been banned in many Moslem countries, including <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Students to Sleep Outside, Eat in Soup Kitchen</HEAD>

 A group of university students plan to get a firsthand look at life through the eyes of the homeless, spending a night on campus streets and queuing up in soup kitchen lines for bread and broth. The program is the brainchild of Sister <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bramlage </PERSON>, coordinator of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dayton </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>, Peace and Community Outreach. `` What we want to do is first of all raise the awareness of students that there is the growing problem in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> with the homeless and also give them a little bit of an experience of what it must be like _ even to a tiny extent _ to be homelesss,'' said Sister <PERSON> Bramlage </PERSON>. She said the program, which is scheduled to begin Thursday, is also designed to encourage students to lobby for more affordable housing. Students in the program will be encouraged not to return to their houses or residence halls for 24 hours and to sleep on the campus plaza. Next day, they will be expected to take their belongings with them to classes. Breakfast will consist of coffee and stale bread. The lunch soup line will offer bread, vegetable soup and water. The alternative to sleeping on the plaza will be attendance at hourly prayer vigils in the chapel all night long, she said. Sister <PERSON> Bramlage </PERSON> said she came up with the idea after students showed a strong interest in the hunger issue. Enrollment at the Catholic university is 6,500. `` I think the fact that families are homeless is just a real serious problem for society,'' she said. `` If we're going to allow that, what's that going to do to the fabric of society?'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Faith </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> for the Homeless, said he thinks the cause is noble, but the students need to understand that they are sleeping outside out of choice. `` It's not terribly different than winter camping,'' Faith said. `` People that are out there on the streets are out there because they have no other options and they have no other choice. And they're doing it night after night after night.'' About 140,000 Ohioans took part in homeless-assistance programs last year, and in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, requests for emergency shelters for families have quadrupled since 1987, Faith said.

<TEXT>
 Searching for their national identity in a post-Hirohito era, the Japanese are embracing values suited to a modern economic powerhouse while sometimes mourning the parting with the old ways. In the early years of Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s reign, which began in 1926, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> embarked on a militaristic course that led to national humiliation and defeat in World War II. Today <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is rich, exerting international influence through financial power, while its military is limited by a constitution that explicitly rejects using international force. The nation's rebirth was the work of wartime survivors who turned their energies to building a rich, peaceful <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. The reign of the new emperor, <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON>, is the era of their children's generation. <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>, the world's longest reigning monarch, was entombed Friday. When older Japanese speak of him, they think of the shared experiences of the war and the long, hard climb out of the ruins of defeat. Many say they thought of <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> as a father figure and that he embodied the traditional Japanese virtues of modesty, loyalty to family, and hard work. He attended diligently to his official functions and to his avocation as a respected marine biologist. `` Judging by what the new emperor has so far said in public, there are strong indications that he has no intention to inherit from his father the role as patriarch of the nation,'' wrote <ORGANIZATION> Kyoto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> Professor <PERSON> Takamitsu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawa </PERSON> in Saturday's <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> Times. As national symbols, <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON> and Empress <PERSON> Michiko </PERSON> are seen as representative of a more modern, international <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. The new monarch `` is said to regard the British type of royalty as an ideal for his reign,'' <PERSON> Sawa </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s death gives <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> an opportunity to break away from a family-patterned society headed by the emperor and embrace values of `` individualism, liberalism and democracy,'' he added. Even some older Japanese have already broken sharply with the old values. Many do feel admiration and sympathy for the imperial family, but others object to the expense of <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s $ 74 million state funeral. `` I think it's outrageous the state went to so much trouble for one individual,'' said <PERSON> Kiyoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Yokoyama </PERSON>, 70. Based on their memories of militarism before and during World War II, Japanese cherish their modern freedoms, says <PERSON> Takashi </PERSON> <PERSON> Inoguchi </PERSON>, professor of political science at <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. But some social critics express concern about what they see as a lack of old-fashioned virtues of loyalty and diligence among <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s youth, who have known only peace and affluence `` The success of the Showa era was not without cost,'' says <ORGANIZATION> Kyoto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> Professor <PERSON> Masataka </PERSON> <PERSON> Kosaka </PERSON>, using the official name of <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s reign. `` Today, ethics have diversified and the people have become open to different views ... but they have lost simple and solid faith.'' Today's Japanese often show little caring for traditional values. During Friday's funeral, when the government urged the public to reflect quietly on <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s passing, tens of thousands took advantage of the national holiday to flee <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> for the ski slopes. `` I'm sure he was an impressive person, but for us it does n't really matter,'' said <PERSON> Tomomi </PERSON> <PERSON> Tominaga </PERSON>, 24, who spent most of Friday in the mountains skiing For young Japanese, the beginning of the new era prompts other reflection. `` Older people probably feel differently, but for us, it's really the beginning of a new era, our era,'' said <PERSON> Naomi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kishi </PERSON>, 30. While the debate continues over <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s historical role, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s new emperor has directed his nation's attention to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s future, pledging to promote peace in his limited role as a national symbol `` Your image ... will live in people's memory for a long time,'' said <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON>, addressing his father's spirit at the funeral. `` But we are now separated in two different worlds. You are now in the world of our ancestors, and I remain in the world of the living.''

 <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> said Sunday he wants strong ties with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to help fight the `` devilish'' West, and Iranian legislators reportedly agreed to consider breaking ties with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s overtures to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, which he previously condemned for its atheist ideology, came during a 1 -LCB- - hour meeting with Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheverdnadze </PERSON> later met Prime Minister <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON> and delivered an invitation for him to visit <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, according to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> did not ask <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> to withdraw his order for Moslem zealots to assassinate British author <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> because of his book `` The Satanic Verses.'' <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> reportedly asked <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> to press <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> to give a reprieve to <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, whose book has been denounced as insulting to <LOCATION> Islam </LOCATION>. `` There was no mention of the affair in <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s speech,'' said <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>. The meeting with <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> came two days after <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> declared <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> does not need relations with the West. This issue has divided the <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> hierarchy between so-called pragmatists, who favor more relations with the rest of the world, and hardliners, who favor continued isolation. However, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s Cabinet declared Sunday it is united behind <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, reported <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION>, which also was monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>. `` Your children are united as a single hand against the enemies of Islam,'' it quoted a <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> statement as saying of the international furor over <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>. The award-winning author born into a Moslem family in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has been in hiding since <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s Feb. 14 execution order, and Iranian religious leaders put a $ 5.2 million bounty on his head. In protest, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> withdrew all its diplomats from its embassy in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, which had been reopened in December after an earlier rift of more than a year. It also asked Iranian diplomats to leave <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. The 11 other <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> countries as well as <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, recalled their top diplomats from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> brought its ambassadors home. No diplomatic ties have been formally broken. But religious leaders in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> last week called for a break with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said more than 100 of the 270 deputies in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> sponsored a bill Sunday to put relations with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> to the vote. The bill was `` passed overwhelmingly,'' making it a priority at the next parliamentary session Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> has apologized for the distress `` The Satanic Verses'' has caused, saying his work was intended to study good and evil from a secular viewpoint and not intended to insult anyone. Many Moslems contend the novel insults Islam by portraying the prophet <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>'s wives as prostitutes and suggesting <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> wrote the Koran, <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>'s holy book, rather than receiving it directly from God. The English-language <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said Sunday that hostile relations with the West stemming from the <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> novel opened `` all doors'' to improving ties with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. It said the two main irritants to better relations with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> _ the Soviet supply of arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s enemy in the 8-year Iran-Iaq war, and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> military presence in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> _ were removed at a time when `` the West has pushed its relations with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to an all time low.'' <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> stressed to <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> the importance of `` the expansion of strong ties in various dimensions in confronting the devilish acts of the West,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> reported. It broadcast extensive excerpts from the meeting at <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s home, which <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said was believed to be the first private meeting between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s 88-year-old revolutionary patriarch and a foreign minister <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> showed <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, wearing a skullcap and robes with a blanket over his knees, talking to <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>. The Soviet leader later met <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON> and the two agreed to set up mechanisms for `` regulating political contacts'' between <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio said. <PERSON> Shervardnadze </PERSON> said <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Konarev </PERSON>, chairman of the Iran-Soviet joint economic commission, will visit <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> shortly `` with significant proposals,'' <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> reported. `` We hope significant chances will take place in bilateral cooperation in the political and economic fields as a result of the current atmosphere,'' he told <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON>. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> was scheduled to return to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Monday. His <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> trip was 10 days.

Ice and snow that built up on highways was blamed for a traffic death early Sunday in the high country of northern <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. The snow in the East was caused by a low pressure system over northwestern <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. Northerly winds around the west side of the low caused locally heavy snow in snow belt areas south of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Superior </LOCATION>. Elsewhere, 8 inches of snow was reported at <LOCATION> Wakefield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, and in <LOCATION> Iron </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>.

Snow fell at the rate of an inch an hour in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Concordia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Topeka </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. Snow melted Sunday in northern <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> because of a combination of recent warm weather and light rain, and local minor flooding was expected along parts of the <ORGANIZATION> Wasatch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> range. Afternoon temperatures were in the upper 70s and 80s in much of southern <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and southern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>.

Sunday's early morning low for the Lower 48 states was 7 below zero at <LOCATION> Warroad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>.

 Here is a transcript of former Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>'s appearance Sunday on the <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION> show `` This Week With <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkley </PERSON>.'' He was questioned by <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON>, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Will </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cokie </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>. DONALDSON: Senator Tower, welcome to our program this morning. TOWER: Thank you, <PERSON> Sam </PERSON>. I'm delighted to be back. It's sort of refreshing to be able to break my silence after three months. DONALDSON: We appreciate your coming in here to do it. You heard Senator <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> this morning suggest that if the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> continues to leak, as he sees it ... TOWER: Mmm-hmm. DONALDSON: ... portions of that <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> report, the committee ought to resume its hearings and call people, put them under subpoena and oath, and take their testimony. Would you agree to that? TOWER: I'm not going to try to advise the committee on what to do, and the committee will arrive at its own decision on that. I am no longer a member of the committee, and I have found that I'm not ... do n't have a great deal of influence over what the committee does. But I am hopeful that we can reduce the level of the rhetoric somewhat ... DONALDSON: Yes, but would that be a fair ... TOWER: ... de-escalate it. DONALDSON: Would that be a fair thing to do? TOWER: Well, I think that, in fairness to the <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> House </LOCATION>, they are reacting to about three months of solid allegations being poured into the public media; and therefore the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, I think, felt it necessary to refer to the more favorable aspects of the report in an effort to shoot down these allegations. As you know, in this business, the answer rarely catches up with the charge. You can be charged with something on a three-column headline above the fold in the paper, and the next day the rebuttal for it or the disproof of it is back on the 23rd page somewhere. And I think that that's what the White House was responding to. The White House was put on the defensive by all of the allegations that came through across the media, and I think that should be understood. DONALDSON: Well, senator ... TOWER: I know one thing, and that is that the committee did n't tell me nor did the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> tell me ... they're very meticulous about this ... what the allegations were And I learned about them by seeing them on television and reading them in the newspaper, and that was my first hint -- DONALDSON: Well, senator ... TOWER: ... that these allegations were out there. DONALDSON: ... as you know, many of the allegations have to do with, to put it rather inelegantly, the charge that you're a common, or uncommon, drunk, that ... TOWER: Mmm-hmm. DONALDSON: ... you admitted that, in the'70s, you had a drinking problem. But the allegations are that it has persisted. Now, what can you tell us to reassure on that point? TOWER: I would deny that allegation. And what I would like to do, in response to that, is to read a portion of letter that was issued by a doctor who took care of me after I was operated on for a colon polyp, in which a very thorough examination was made. And I will not read the entire letter, although the entire letter I think is very revealing. DONALDSON: It will be made part of the record?

 <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Little </PERSON>, whose acquittal in the 1974 slaying of a <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> jail guard brought worldwide attention, has been arrested on stolen property and weapon charges, police said. Ms. <PERSON> Little </PERSON>, 34, was arrested Friday afternoon with a male companion at the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> entrance to the <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tunnel </LOCATION>, which links northern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. She was released on bail Saturday, police said Sunday. Police noticed the car she was driving was missing its front license plate, and a computer check showed the rear plate was stolen, said <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedlander </PERSON>, an officer with the police force of the <ORGANIZATION> Port </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, which runs the tunnel. A search of the car turned up a razor knife and gambling slips, <PERSON> Friedlander </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Little </PERSON> also gave false identification to police, he said. Capt. <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> police department said Ms. <PERSON> Little </PERSON> posted $ 500 bail Saturday evening and was released. Ms. <PERSON> Little </PERSON> was charged with possession of a prohibited weapon, possession of prohibited gambling devices, possession of stolen property, driving with a suspended license, and false reporting to authorities and wrongful impersonation, <PERSON> Friedlander </PERSON> said. She gave as her address a location in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The arrested man has not been identified because he offered police several different identification cards, <PERSON> Friedlander </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> said she did not know whether the man arrested was released. In 1975, Ms. <PERSON> Little </PERSON> was acquitted of stabbing a jailer to death with an ice pick in 1974 in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. She said she killed the guard in self-defense after he tried to sexually assault her. The case drew wide attention because she, as a black woman, aimed her accusation against a white jailer. At the time of the incident, Ms. <PERSON> Little </PERSON> was in jail while appealing a conviction on breaking and entering charges. The appeal failed and she was sentenced to seven years. Ms. <PERSON> Little </PERSON>, who escaped once and was recaptured in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, was paroled in June 1979.

 <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> entered a living nightmare when the American Steel Foundries plant where he worked for 19 years closed in 1982. But <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, 51, learned last week that <ORGANIZATION> ASF </ORGANIZATION> plans to resume production at its foundry, once the nation's largest producer of railroad undercarriages, and he's eligible for recall. `` I ca n't think of anything else that would make me happier than to see this plant open up,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said. `` I have tears in my eyes right now.'' The foundry's revival is a godsend for the more than 200 workers who will be rehired. An estimated 650 employees were laid off when the plant closed. Though he eventually managed to find another job, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> remembers the closure all too well. Bills mounted while he struggled to find work, and unemployment put a strain on his marriage, which ended in divorce about three years ago. He also sought professional help to calm his nerves. `` When we shut down, most of us said we're going to get two, three month's rest,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> recalled. `` Six months later when your unemployment runs out, you say, ` Hey, what's going to happen to me?' `` Then, a year later, it's a nightmare.'' At its peak in 1979, when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturers produced about 94,000 railroad cars, the foundry employed about 1,700 people, according to <ORGANIZATION> ASF </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Berg </PERSON>. Several factors led to the railroad parts industry's collapse just three years later, including deregulation of the railroads. `` They could operate more efficiently, and really, they did n't need many cars,'' <PERSON> Berg </PERSON> said Also, companies that invested heavily in railroad cars during the late 1970s, in order to lease them to the railroads, pulled out when the economy soured. As a result, the industry in the early 1980s faced a surplus of almost 300,000 railroad cars, said <PERSON> Elwyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahnquist </PERSON>, president of the Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Car </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. In 1982, fewer than 19,000 railroad cars were produced nationwide. But now, <PERSON> Ahnquist </PERSON> and <PERSON> Berg </PERSON> say the railroad parts industry is gaining steam because of a decline in the surplus of railroad cars to about 40,000. And many of the 1.2 million cars in use are obsolete or nearly so. And in May, <PERSON> Berg </PERSON> said, the foundry here will resume producing cast steel side frames and bolsters, which form the undercarriages, or trucks, of railroad cars. Thirty-five employees are getting the plant ready for reopening and in the next couple of weeks 30 more will be added, plant manager <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Donovan </PERSON> said. By early summer, the company expects to recall 200 more workers at roughly $ 10 an hour, he said. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> says he's happier for his former co-workers who never landed a job after the plant closed. It took him two years, but he finally found work as a supervisor at another steel-related plant in <LOCATION> Granite </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. And, if the money is right _ he makes between $ 30,000 and $ 40,000 annually now _ he said he'd love to go back to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Steel </LOCATION>, calling it `` the best company to work for.'' `` Whether I go back or not, I am concerned about my co-workers,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said. `` Hopefully, they'll be able to go to work at <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> and say: ` Hey! Once again I'm a working man. I have my pride back.'''

 About 3,000 Namibian guerrilla supporters Sunday welcomed the chief of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping force that will oversee the transition of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s last colony into an independent nation. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Dewan </PERSON> <PERSON> Prem-Chand </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Windheok </LOCATION>, the Namibian capital, a week ahead of the first troops he will command as head of the military component of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- UNTAG -RRB-. The only exception to the warm welcome were complaints by some supporters of the guerrilla <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> that the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> decided to send only 4,650 troops to <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, rather than the 7,500 sought by the guerrilla organization and other African countries. They are to keep peace when the independence process begins April 1 in the territory <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has ruled for 74 years. Favored to win independence elections planned in early November is the <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, the guerrilla movement that has waged a 22-year <PERSON> bush </PERSON> war against <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>'s troops. <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> agreed to implement the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> independence plan in December. The plan originally called for 4,650 peacekeeping troops in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, but the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> decided on the smaller number in a bid to keep down costs estimated at more than $ 400 million. At a brief news conference, <PERSON> Prem-Chand </PERSON> said he thinks he has sufficient troops to perform his mission in the territory, which is about twice the size of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> but is one of the world's most sparsely populated lands with only 1.3 million people. Gen. <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON>, head of the South African-led military in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, met Prem-Chand and his 12 senior assistants at <LOCATION> Windhoek </LOCATION> airport. <PERSON> Prem-Chand </PERSON> said he plans to travel extensively and meet other key figures in the territory in coming days. Twenty-three countries have agreed to provide troops, military observers and civilians for the <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> operation. The election campaign is to begin in July. <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION>'s chief rival is expected to be the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Turnhalle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, a multiracial coalition backed by the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> government that favors free enterprise and a multiparty democracy. Four other political parties announced Saturday they have merged to become the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. Their decision not to join <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION>, which has a similar poltical platform, was seen as a setback for the guerrilla movement. <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> has yet to detail its plans. However, the organization says it favors a socialist economy and has not stated whether it would allow the existence of other political parties.

 World leaders wrapped up their visits on Sunday and asked <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to take a bigger role in <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace efforts and spread more of its great wealth to developing nations. The funeral of Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>, which drew representatives of 163 nations, provided an unusual chance for leaders to meet in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> without some of the constraints of diplomatic protocol. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> met with 20 world leaders before leaving Saturday for <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and then <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. Japanese Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> met with nearly 40 and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Sousuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> held talks with about 90 officials. On Sunday, <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> asked for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to play a larger role in U.N.-sponsored peace talks between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, news reports said. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> told <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s help was important because of a worsening of relations between Western countries and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> over the controversial book `` The Satanic Verses,'' <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> reported. In a meeting Sunday with Iranian Vice President <PERSON> Mostafa </PERSON> <PERSON> Mir </PERSON> <PERSON> Salim </PERSON>, Japanese Foreign Minister <PERSON> Sousuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> said he hoped <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> would rescind its `` intolerable'' death threat against author <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, a ministry official said. But <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> had no plan to follow European nations' lead and withdraw its ambassador from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in protest over the death threat. `` We have chosen the course of expressing our opinions to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and maintaining relations,'' the official said. Uno pledged in a separate meeting with Iraqi Vice President <PERSON> Taha </PERSON> <PERSON> Muhi </PERSON> <PERSON> Dim </PERSON> <PERSON> Maruf </PERSON> to help <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> rebuild after a peace settlement is achieved with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> reported. In talks with Israeli President <PERSON> Chaim </PERSON> <PERSON> Herzog </PERSON>, <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> hopes for an international peace conference on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> that will include the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, another ministry official said. But <PERSON> Herzog </PERSON> reiterated <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s position that it will refuse to meet with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> considers a terrorist organization, the official said. <LOCATION> Qatar </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Sheikh </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> bin </PERSON> <PERSON> Saif </PERSON> <PERSON> Thani </PERSON> asked Uno Sunday to allow the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> to open an embassy in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, but <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> refused the request, <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> reported. Although the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> does not have diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, it maintains an office in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> and sent a representative to <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s funeral on Friday. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> expressed support to Thai Prime Minister <PERSON> Chatichai </PERSON> <PERSON> Choonhaven </PERSON> for his country's peace efforts in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and pledged that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> will contribute more toward a settlement of the conflict, <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Chatichai </PERSON> told <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> that he hoped upcoming summit talks between <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> would help bring an end to the war, it said. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> supports <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, which invaded <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> 10 years ago, while <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has assisted Cambodian guerrilla groups fighting the Vietnamese. <PERSON> Chatichai </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> hopes to further strengthen its economic ties with <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> said. Although many Japanese expressed pride over the record number of countries attending <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s funeral, some said part of the reason for the large number was <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s new status as the world's largest giver of development aid. Among the nations asking for increased Japanese economic assistance and investment Sunday were <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tanzania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> promised new aid to <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> Sunday in talks with President <PERSON> Suharto </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> reported. The <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> president said his country faces a foreign debt of about $ 38 billion. On Thursday, <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> pledged up to $ 1 billion in new assistance for debt-ridden <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>.

 The Sandinistas will hand over power if they lose the 1990 presidential election, a government official was quoted as saying on Sunday. President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> will `` abandon power immediately'' if he loses the February 1990 election, <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Minister <PERSON> Tomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Borge </PERSON> told a group of disabled war veterans, the pro-government daily <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuevo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diario </ORGANIZATION> said.

He also said the party had n't discussed who its candidate would be. Even though <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> has not made his candidacy official, he has spoken publicly about running for re-election. Party faithful greeted him at a political rally near <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> Saturday with placards calling for him to run in 1990. <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Nueveo </PERSON> <PERSON> Diario </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Borge </PERSON> as saying the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> would win because they are `` the biggest and the best.'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> announced earlier this month at a Central American summit meeting in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> that <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> would hold elections in February 1990 instead of November.

 Conductor <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Karajan </PERSON> and the <PERSON> Vienna </PERSON> <PERSON> Philharmonic </PERSON> took a familiar piece of music, <PERSON> Schubert </PERSON>'s `` Unfinished Symphony,'' and not only made it fresh but made it sound like a miracle of composition. Most of the audience at Carnegie Hall for the first of two concerts by the <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> conducted by <PERSON> Karajan </PERSON> had heard the `` Unfinished'' numerous times. Saturday night's audience heard it as though experiencing it for the first time. The <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> can playas softly as a murmur. But there are aspects to this magnificent orchestra's playing that one forgets. Sound can swell in certain groups of instruments without getting generally loud. Low-toned instruments can convey depths of feeling. The playing _ and not only the famous silken violins _ is so smooth that a listener's breathing is calmed. <PERSON> Karajan </PERSON> brought up sections of instruments whose sound was n't emotionally whipped up but seemed to be filled with emotion But the most awe-inspiring aspect was the playing of <PERSON> Schubert </PERSON>'s melodic themes Each began like a tiny shoot through the surrounding ground of the orchestral playing and grew straight, getting bigger, to bud then bloom. The themes were n't overblown or overpowering, but we never heard them so majestic. <PERSON> Karajan </PERSON>, who is 80, has been music director of the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Philharmonic since 1955. He has long conducted the <ORGANIZATION> Vienna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Philharmonic </ORGANIZATION>, both at the <LOCATION> Salzburg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Festival </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. This is the first time he has conducted it here in 30 years. The orchestra currently has no resident conductor. Some expected <PERSON> Karajan </PERSON> to enter the stage in a wheelchair, but he walked, holding the arm of a musician. The back of the podium was made with a kind of bench, against which <PERSON> Karajan </PERSON> leaned while he conducted. He walked off the stage and then walked back to the podium to take bows. He received standing ovations at every entrance and exit. The second half of the program was short pieces by <PERSON> Johann </PERSON> and <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON>, which the <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> Philharmonic annually plays on a televised New Year's concert. These can be breezy confections, but the <ORGANIZATION> Vienna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Philharmonic </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Karajan </PERSON> gave them more substance than that. The overture to `` The Gypsy Baron'' was trippingly joyful and one could see the spirit of a young man in the maestro's gestures. `` Music of the Spheres'' had majestic yearning, an uplighting section and flowing sweetness. `` Annen-Polka'' floated delicately its second time through. The less familiar `` Hilarion Waltz'' began with a storm brewing, became expansive with pretty melodies and continued through several elaborate sections. `` Perpetuum mobile,'' which is dizzyingly fast, ended by fading away and <PERSON> Karajan </PERSON> giving a theatrical `` what could I do?'' shrug. `` The Emperor Waltz'' evokes the ringing sound of success and an opulent way of life.

<HEAD>Grosz: Multi-Party System Means ``Less Room For Bad Decisions''</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Karoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> said Sunday the introduction of a multiparty system will leave `` less room for bad decisions'' but wo n't solve all of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s problems. `` The introduction of a multi-party system in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> is a novelty but not a historic event,'' <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> was quoted as saying by the state news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. `` Even a multi-party system is not a guarantee that grave social mistakes will not be repeated.'' Pluralism, <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> said, is likely to bring about `` less room for bad decisions because the parties will be publicly controlling one another.'' <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> was interviewed in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> by <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION>'s director general <PERSON> Mihailo </PERSON> <PERSON> Saranovic </PERSON> prior to a brief visit to <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> Monday for talks with his Yugoslav counterpart, <PERSON> Stipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Suvar </PERSON>, on reform in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc and bilateral relations. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> endorsed a multiparty system for the first time earlier this month, but stressed the transition to more pluralism should be gradual and orderly. In a separate development, the state news agency <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> reported that <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> will drop the traditional May Day parade this year after 44 years of observation. In a report late Saturday, the agency did not spell out the reasons for which the workers' demonstration, an annual fixture in the Soviet bloc, was abolished. Participants at a weekend meeting laying the groundwork for an independent trade union of young workers said they believed among the reasons the May 1 parade was dropped was that authorities were `` fearful'' of posters calling for better living conditions for Hungarian workers or voicing other complaints. `` Even if they say no, we shall sponsor our own parade,'' said a participant. In place of the parade, authorities plan to stage a rally at which <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> will make a speech, <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> said. The announcement appeared to indicate that May Day would still remain a holiday in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s policy-setting <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, in a statement released after a highly secretive two-day meeting Feb. 10-11, said it had decided a multiparty system would provide a `` better safeguard'' against abuse of power than the single-party rule initiatied with the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> takeover in 1948. If <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> implements genuine power-sharing, it would be the first <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc country to have a bona fide multiparty system. The Hungarian <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, which is increasingly outspoken, is to pass a bill legalizing alternative political parties by Aug. 1, 1989. <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>, however, told <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> that the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> does not plan to relinquish its leading role in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. Dozens of independent groups have formed in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> over the past year, several of which are likely to become political parties. The Smallholders and the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parties </ORGANIZATION> have announced their return after 40 years. Both were essentially dissolved when the Communists came to power in 1948.

<HEAD>Nearly Half Of Force Laid Off Despite Community Fund Drive</HEAD>
<DATELINE>McKEESPORT, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A community effort to raise $ 90,000 to pay police officers a raise fell short of its goal and nearly half the city's force was laid off Sunday. Mayor <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Washowich </PERSON> said donations may allow officials to call back a few of the 21 idled officers as early as Friday, but only for a limited time. <PERSON> Washowich </PERSON> said the layoffs were necessary because state arbitrators recently awarded the police department wage increases of 4 percent to 4 -LCB- percent, which the <LOCATION> Allegheny </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> city could not afford. City officials have said officers made an average of about $ 28,000 a year before the raise, while the police bargaining unit has said the average was closer to $ 25,000. The mayor said fund-raising is not a long-term solution. `` I do n't want to create false hopes for people,'' he said. <PERSON> Washowich </PERSON> has said laying off 21 officers from the force of about 50 for three months would save the city $ 90,000. But wage increases and benefits for the police will cost between $ 110,000 and $ 120,000 this year and an additional $ 225,000 next year, he said. McKeesport's volunteer ambulance company began the fund-raising effort Thursday with a $ 15,000 donation. A restaurant planned to contribute proceeds from Sunday's sales, which could raise $ 5,000 to $ 7,000, according to manager <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Balistreri </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Equibank </ORGANIZATION> officials said Saturday that the company would match money raised during the coming week, up to $ 50,000. <ORGANIZATION> Equibank </ORGANIZATION> employees plan to canvass <LOCATION> McKeesport </LOCATION> for donations Wednesday. Officer <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Carloss </PERSON>, head of the police department's wage and policy committee, said the ambulance company's $ 15,000 alone would be enough to keep officers working for another two weeks. <PERSON> Carloss </PERSON> said he was surprised and angered by the mayor's decision to proceed with layoffs as planned. <PERSON> Carloss </PERSON> was among those affected. `` It's a total slap in the face of the citizens of <LOCATION> McKeesport </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Carloss </PERSON> said. `` These people are going out of their way to save the police.'' He said the mayor wanted to punish the police for going to arbitration. <PERSON> Washowich </PERSON> said he based his decision solely on the need to balance the city's budget.

 Fire destroyed an old bus where a 70-year-old woman and her daughter had lived in primitive conditions for 10 years, and the blaze also killed most of the chickens on which they depended for food. `` We lost everything,'' said <PERSON> Leah </PERSON> <PERSON> Succkosh </PERSON>. `` We ai n't got anything to eat, we ai n't got no blankets, nothing.'' The bus, stripped of its wheels, sat on a wooded, rural lot that the women said was their land. A motel agreed to take them and their two dogs for the weekend. `` If we could find a trailer so that they could stay on the land, that would be ideal,'' said <PERSON> Tot </PERSON> <PERSON> Ratliff </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Concern </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Slidell </LOCATION> relief agency. <PERSON> Succkosh </PERSON> escaped without injury from Friday's fire. Her daughter, <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON>, 40, suffered first - and second-degree facial burns when she went back into the burning bus to rescue the dogs She was treated at <ORGANIZATION> Slidell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> and released, a hospital spokeswoman said. Most of their 65 chickens were killed. They had taken the birds into the bus to keep them warm when the temperature dropped below freezing in last week's cold wave. The women fed themselves and their dogs on the hens' eggs. `` We had to literally fight them to keep them from going back in the structure to save those chickens,'' Assistant Fire Chief <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said. The women had no electricity or plumbing. They got water from a hand pump next to the bus. For cooking and heat, they had an old wood stove inside the bus. There was no outhouse and firefighters found a bucket full of waste, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said. `` Never in my life have I seen people living in these kinds of conditions,'' he said. Neighbors said the women stayed to themselves. <PERSON> Ratliff </PERSON> said the women lived there by choice and refused her agency's offers of help to find them better living quarters.

 A fierce storm in the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> sank or disabled eight ships on Sunday, and rescue workers said eight people drowned and 25 were missing and presumed dead. At least 80 people were rescued. The storm, which battered a wide section of the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, produced winds up to 80 mph and 30-foot waves. In <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, strong winds knocked over billboards and blew off parts of roofs, killing five people in the eastern city of <LOCATION> Valencia </LOCATION> and two more in central <ORGANIZATION> Valladolid </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Spanish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> reported. A man drowned when his canoe overturned in the Trasona reservoir in the northern <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, the radio reported. Two vessels sank during the storm and one ran aground. In the most serious incident, a <LOCATION> Nigerian </LOCATION> cargo ship with 46 people aboard developed engine trouble two miles off <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Espichel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>, a rocky promontory. Gale-force winds and 16-foot waves then drove the 3,000-ton ship, the <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gurara </LOCATION>, onto the rocks, a spokesman for the <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> navy said. A Portugese frigate picked up 27 people, including three women and three children, from lifeboats, said the spokesman. Rescue workers recovered eight bodies but called off their search for the 11 people still missing. A Singapore-registered freighter, the <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonhardt </PERSON>, issued a distress call and sank off <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> coast Saturday, and rescue workers searched fruitlessly Sunday for 14 sailors who were aboard. `` I think there's no longer any chance to find them,'' said <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Reuillot </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Morbihan </LOCATION> in western <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. Several hours later, the search was called off. <PERSON> Reuillot </PERSON> said the captain radioed late Saturday to say he and the crew were abandoning the sinking ship in heavy seas about 220 miles west of <LOCATION> Bordeaux </LOCATION>. The cause of the <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonhardt </PERSON>'s distress was not clear. <PERSON> Reuillot </PERSON> said searchers found debris from the 3,895-ton ship, including lifeboats and life rafts. The search was hampered by howling winds and 30-foot waves. Tugboats from the <ORGANIZATION> Lisbon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Port </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> towed a Bulgarian cargo ship to shore after it caught fire and was listing badly in heavy seas about six miles off <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION>. Officials were unable to say how many people were aboard the Voyana, but they said four people from the ship were injured, none seriously. An unidentified Libyan vessel with 30 people aboard had engine trouble off northern <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> was towed to shore by a tugboat from <PERSON> Vigo </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. Off the coast of Santander in northern <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, a passing fishing vessel rescued the 13-man crew of the <ORGANIZATION> Santo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cristo </ORGANIZATION> de Festerrat after the Spanish fishing boat sank in high seas. Another Spanish fishing vessel, the Agosare, was towed to the northern port of Gijon after it reported it was in danger 25 miles off the northern Spanish coast, said <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> maritime officals. They did not know how many were aboard. Two other vessels were disabled by the storm off <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. A lifeboat crew from <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION> rescued five fishermen from their vessel, which was drifting toward coastal rocks in heavy seas and high winds, rescue authorities said. A helicopter from the <ORGANIZATION> Brawdy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> base in <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION> flew out to a Soviet trawler battered by 30-foot waves 260 miles out in the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> and winched aboard a crewman who suffered serious arm injuries on the boat.

<HEAD>Opposition Group Rips Walesa Stand</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An opposition group called on workers to strike and said Sunday that the talks between the Solidarity labor movement and the government will `` prolong totalitarian rule.'' Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, meanwhile, told a rally in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> that workers must refrain from strikes while the talks on political and economic reforms continue. But the meeting by renegade activists in the southern city of <LOCATION> Jastrzebie </LOCATION> criticized <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s moderate stand. Up to 120 people were arrested and held briefly Friday and Saturday to prevent them from attending the weekend meeting, said opposition figure <PERSON> Jozef </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinior </PERSON>. <PERSON> Pinior </PERSON>, a leader of the banned <ORGANIZATION> Polish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said the meeting resulted in a resolution calling for free elections and the removal of the `` monopolistic authority'' of the communist party. The resolution said workers should use strikes to achieve their political goals and criticized stands taken at the talks. `` The round-table talks will have our support only when they are not used to prevent workers' protests,'' said the resolution, quoted by <PERSON> Pinior </PERSON>. `` The model of an anti-worker economic reform accepted by the negotiators at the roundtable is unacceptable and only serves to make more credible and to prolong totalitarian rule,'' it said. <PERSON> Pinior </PERSON> said the congress was attended by members of his group, the banned peace group <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> And </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION>, the militant splinter group <ORGANIZATION> Fighting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Solidarity </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Students </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Meanwhile, in the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said the talks need at least three more weeks of labor calm. `` He who wants to make trouble should go away from here immediately. I am asking on my knees that you not destroy our country,'' he said, addressing about 2,000 people after a Mass at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brygida </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. `` There are reasons for strikes everywhere,'' he said. `` But now we have to mobilize ourselves and refrain.'' But <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> made clear that continued labor peace was contingent upon further government liberalizations. `` If there are no reforms by April or May, I, <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, will call for struggle,'' He said. After <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> spoke, about 200 young people staged a noisy march in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>, chanting `` Solidarity.'' The government and a broad spectrum of opposition groups have been meeting since Feb. 6 to negotiate sweeping economic, political and social change in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. The government says it will consider legalizing Solidarity if it agrees to be a party to reforms. Solidarity was the first independent labor union in the Soviet bloc when it was founded in 1980. It was outlawed after the imposition of martial law in 1981.

She said the amount of trade was only $ 100 million and as a result some commentators considered the dispute of little importance. `` Trust me, it's not,'' she said, warning that if beef is the target on this occasion `` what happens next month when a trading partner does not want to buy our corn because it has been sprayed with a certain pesticide.'' <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told Mrs. <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> that many companies in his state complain to him about the difficulty getting export licenses from the federal government, particularly high tech companies. `` It is frustrating for those who apply,'' she said. `` Yet the national interest is such that they must apply.

<HEAD>Pinochet Emerging As Favorite On Right To Run For President</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EVA VERGARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Military ruler <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, repudiated by voters in a referendum last year, is being wooed by the right to run for president again, officials said. `` Many think the diversity of candidates is making it quite difficult to reach a candidate of consensus, and the one who may be closest is President <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>,'' Defense Minister <PERSON> Patricio </PERSON> <PERSON> Carvajal </PERSON> said in a recent interview. When the military government offered <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> as the only candidate in a referendum in October, Chileans rejected the bid of the 73-year-old army commander to extend his authoritarian rule until 1997. The terms of the constitution, drafted under the military government, now call for an open presidential election on Dec. 14. The constitution holds that the president can not seek re-election to a consecutive term. Reform of the constitution is seen as the only means of allowing <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> to be nominated as the official candidate. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> backers, however, say the constitutional restriction does not apply to the general since he was not elected in the first place. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> seized power in a 1973 military coup that toppled the elected government of Marxist President <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Allende </PERSON>, who died in the overthrow. <PERSON> Patricio </PERSON> <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON>, 70, president of the centrist <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Demoratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the man who led the opposition coalition campaign against <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> in October, is considered the frontrunner in a field of at least four contenders for the opposition presidential nomination. The opposition said it will support a single candidate in the December election and the nomination is expected to be made next month. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> announced only recently he would not be a candidate. He made clear he intends to direct the pro-government campaign and even pick the candidate to succeed him. `` Soon I will tell you whom we shall support. Let's not rush things,'' the general told supporters in a recent trip thorugh the country. Yet many supporters are still urging him to run. The two largest parties on the right, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Renovation </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, joined in backing <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> in the October referendum, but disputes have since distanced the two. Divisions also have surfaced among smaller pro-government parties over centenders for the official candidacy, including two who have already launched their bids: extreme-right lawyer <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> <PERSON> Diez </PERSON>, former ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in the Pinochet government. Others on the right are looking to <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s 39-year-old Finance Minister <PERSON> Hernan </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchi </PERSON>. <PERSON> Alejandro </PERSON> <PERSON> Navarrete </PERSON>, mayor of <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s second-largest city, the neighboring port city of <LOCATION> Valparaiso </LOCATION>, said the number of potential candidates `` is causing <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s political figure to loom large.'' Observers say the disunity on the right is also being fueled by disagreements over calls for political and constitutional reform. For instance, some in the opposition are demanding that the next presidential term, to begin in March 1990, run four years and not the eight dictated by the constitution. While some forces on the right support a shortened term, others call it an opposition attempt to ruin the presidency. The opposition also is seeking changes to the constitution, which now guarantees <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> extraordinary powers even after leaving office. Under the existing constitution, an ex-President <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> would be made a senator for life. He and the other armed forces chiefs, as well as the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> director, would continue to lead their respective institutions for eight years.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> has begun a series of special maintenance checks on its aircraft following the accident near <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> in which nine people died, the airline said Sunday. The maintenance checks are `` over and above -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s -RRB- existing procedures and those required by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>. `` By announcing these steps, we want to make clear that we are not speculating and will not speculate on the cause of Friday's incident,'' <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said in a company statement `` By the same token, we have an absolute commitment to safety and we intend to go well beyond our already-strict standards and <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> requirements.'' A cargo door may have popped open on <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> Flight 811, ripping a hole in the side of the 18-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747, which was flying at 22,000 feet about 100 miles south of <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>, federal investigators have said. Nine of the 354 people on board were blown out and are presumed dead. The plane returned safely to <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> also said the 747 involved in Friday's accident on Flight 811 was in compliance with all <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> airworthiness directives and maintenance requirements. However, the jet's cargo door locks had not yet been modified under a July order by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Adminstration </ORGANIZATION> that airlines improve cargo door lock systems on older <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747s after a door in one plane partly opened in flight. The deadline for that work is the end of this year. United had inspected all 25 of its jets covered by the order but had completed the required modifications on just six by last week, spokesman <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. The plane in Friday's accident was not one of the six, he said Because the right forward cargo door was suspected in the incident, <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> checked all cargo doors on its fleet of 31 747s and all were found to be in proper working order. In addition, a `` detailed technical inspection emcompassing all latches, seals, fittings and other parts of the door mechanisms'' was expected to be completed Sunday. Similar inspections were to be done on all aircraft in <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s fleet, the statement said. It also said an FAA-licensed mechanic will inspect each 747 cargo door upon arrival at a destination, in addition to regular pre-departure inspections; and such mechanics will oversee the closing of each 747 cargo door before departures. The closings have been handled by `` trained ramp service personnel,'' the statement said.

 <LOCATION> TABA </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israeli-Held </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sinai </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> signed a historic agreement Sunday that will turn this desert beach strip over to <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and end a seven-year border dispute that has marred relations. The agreement calling for Israelis to withdraw from the 250-acre resort by March 15 was signed at the Sonesta hotel in <LOCATION> Taba </LOCATION>, northern Sinai. Both sides joined <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mediators in expressing hope that future disputes between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and its Arab neighbors can be solved through negotiations. `` A new chapter is starting and we sincerely hope it will lead to the road of a comprehensive peace,'' said <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s chief negotiator, <PERSON> Nabil </PERSON> <PERSON> El-Araby </PERSON>. His Israeli counterpart, <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> Director-General <PERSON> Reuven </PERSON> <PERSON> Merhav </PERSON> added: `` It is a splended example and a shining beacon of hope. We in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> believe negotiations are the only possible path to peace.'' A key point of the accord will allow Israelis to visit the resort for up to 14 days without visas or special entry fees. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> also will continue supplying water and electricity to the area. The agreement was approved Sunday by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 10-member inner Cabinet by a 8-1 vote with one abstention. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, who voted for the agreement, said he nevertheless regretted the results. `` To my great sorrow the drama has ended as it has ended,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said at a Sunday night rally of his right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc in northern <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` My stand was well known. I opposed the turn to arbitration and instead wanted to turn to compromise,'' he said. `` If we had agreed to compromise we would not have had to leave <LOCATION> Taba </LOCATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> opposed the agreement in 1986 to enter binding arbitration. They preferred non-binding negotiations. International arbitrators on Sept. 29 delineated the border in such a way as to put the beach in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> delayed implementation of the ruling pending negotiations over obtaining easy access for tourists and receiving compensation for the hotel and a neighboring holiday village. Under the agreement, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> will purchase the Sonesta for $ 37 million and the holiday village for $ 1.5 million. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s Tourism Minister, <PERSON> Fuad </PERSON> <PERSON> Sultan </PERSON>, said <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> tourists will be `` extremely welcome.'' The dispute over <LOCATION> Taba </LOCATION>, which borders on the southern <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Eilat </LOCATION>, began in April 1982 when <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> refused to withdraw from the strip as it ended a 15-year occupation of the bulk of the <LOCATION> Sinai </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, Mayor <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>'s most vocal supporter, urges voters to `` maintain the gains'' that blacks have brought to city hall, but others are predicting that <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> could become the first major city to have a black mayor defeated by a white. Several variables could alter the result, but the most likely scenario _ according to pundits and polls _ has <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, who is white and the son of late Mayor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, winning Tuesday's Democratic primary and the April 4 election. Blacks fear that losing power in City Hall would erase gains achieved by <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>, the city's first black mayor, who died a few months into his second term in 1987. `` Of course that fear helps motivate people to get out the vote,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Starks </PERSON>, professor of political science at <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Northeastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Starks </PERSON> is chairman of a task force on black political power which he said helped elect <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in 1983. `` Not only would it be the first loss of a black mayor, it would also be a loss of the completion of <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>'s last two years in office,'' <PERSON> Starks </PERSON> said. `` It would be a tragic loss.'' Even if <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> managed to win Tuesday _ and a newspaper poll a week ago had him gaining on <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> but still 8 percentage points behind _ it would not guarantee that a black would stay in City Hall. The <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> candidate in April will be white _ and could be former <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> nemesis <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON>, who is running a write-in campaign for the Republican nomination. That candidate would face <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> and third-party candidate <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, a black alderman. A split in the black vote could put a white in office. After <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> died, <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> was elected his successor in a raucous <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> meeting by a coalition made up mostly of white aldermen who opposed <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told an Operation PUSH meeting Saturday that <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> has `` maintained the gains'' brought by <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, and he has urged the divided black electorate to unite behind <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> in the primary. But he also stressed that race is not the only factor in the election, saying, `` The issue fundamentally is about forwards and backwards; it's about being progressive or regressive, so I think that to center the analysis on race misses much of the point.'' The era of big-city black mayors in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> began in 1967, when <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> was elected in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Gary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavanagh </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s Center for the Study of American Government in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> have followed suit, he said, and a black incumbent in a big city has yet to lose to a white. <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> now has a white mayor, but that happened after <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> decided not to seek re-election, <PERSON> Cavanagh </PERSON> said in a telephone interview Sunday. In <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, political turmoil sparked by <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s death will be to blame if a black ca n't hold City Hall, <PERSON> Cavanagh </PERSON> said. `` Exploiting divisions within the minority community is one way that the traditional white leadership can regain power,'' he said. Cities such as <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, where fewer than 50 percent of voters are black, are especially vulnerable, he said. <PERSON> Cavanagh </PERSON> said it's only to be expected that `` you're going to have reversals from time to time.'' But to <PERSON> Starks </PERSON>, such a loss in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> would create a call to go back to work. `` There will be a doubling of organizing efforts to come back stronger than ever in 1991,'' he said.

<HEAD>Actor Timothy Hutton Awarded $9.75 Million in MGM Lawsuit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Oscar-winning actor <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON> was awarded $ 9.75 million by a jury that decided <ORGANIZATION> MGM </ORGANIZATION> deceived him about the reason for canceling the 1983 movie `` Roadshow.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury found in an 11-1 verdict on Friday that the studio committed fraud and breach of contract. The jury awarded <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON> $ 2.25 million in compensatory damages and $ 7.5 million in punitive damages. <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON> claimed studio executives told him the picture, about a modern-day cattle drive, was being terminated because the director, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>, had suffered a heart attack. Actually, <ORGANIZATION> MGM </ORGANIZATION> lost interest in the movie after a change of management, the actor contended. `` We were able to prove at the trial that <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> was n't even under contract and that <ORGANIZATION> MGM </ORGANIZATION> had lied about <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>' commitment to even direct the movie,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Tierney </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON>'s attorney. <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON>, who won an Academy Award for his role in the 1980 film `` Ordinary People,'' claimed <ORGANIZATION> MGM </ORGANIZATION> deprived him of other possible roles by failing to tell him of its decision for several months. The month-long trial included testimony from other `` Roadshow'' actors, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicholson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Steenburgen </PERSON>, agent <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Mengers </PERSON> and directors <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> and <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritt </PERSON>. <PERSON> Nicholson </PERSON> `` resolved matters'' with <ORGANIZATION> MGM </ORGANIZATION> several years ago, and Miss <PERSON> Steenburgen </PERSON> settled a lawsuit for an undisclosed sum, according to a company attorney who asked not to be named, the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported Sunday. MGM is now owned by <ORGANIZATION> Turner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Turner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> will seek a further review of the verdict, the company attorney told the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 An estimated 400 to 500 anti-abortion sympathizers sang and chanted Sunday in front of a jail to support two ministers there who are in the ninth day of a water-only fast. The Rev. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Cadwallader </PERSON>, 40, and the Rev. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, 38, waved from a sixth-floor window at the <ORGANIZATION> Erie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holding </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> to the gathering that lined a sidewalk across the street. The protesters stood behind a large banner that read, `` We Love You <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jim </PERSON>.'' `` The fast is going fine and God is feeding us mightily,'' the two wrote in a letter that was read at the demonstration. `` The court may have meant this for bad but God meant it for good.'' The two ministers have been in jail since refusing to post $ 100 bail each following their arrest Feb. 17 on charges of trespassing and resisting arrest. They and four other anti-abortion protesters chained themselves to the entrance of a medical clinic in suburban <LOCATION> Kenmore </LOCATION> where abortions are performed. Kenmore Village Justice J. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Gruber </PERSON> said the two ministers must post bail because they have been arrested before in anti-abortion protests in the village. <PERSON> Gruber </PERSON> said the village requires repeat offenders to post bail. The protesters Sunday sang hymns and chanted `` We Love You'' to the ministers, who have affixed a small paper cross to the window of their jail cell. `` <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> went to jail because they had no money for their bail,'' they sang. ` Be a hero, save a whale; save a baby, go to jail.'' `` Our main purpose is to show love and support for the two pastors,'' said <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Bainbridge </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clergy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Project </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION>, which has conducted anti-abortion protests across the country. The Rev. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Schenck </PERSON>, co-chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Clergy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, said he spoke with the ministers Saturday and said that, having had only water twice daily, they `` sounded weak.'' `` Both of them said they're quite cold,'' he said `` But their spirits are very, very good.'' <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Russi </PERSON>, the administrator at the holding center, said the men, who have refused all solid food, are being examined by doctors every two days. `` The moment I feel I have a problem, I will go in front of a judge and get a court order to force-feed them,'' said <PERSON> Russi </PERSON>. <PERSON> Schenck </PERSON> said he did n't thin the fast would continue to the point where it was life-threatening. `` It's not a point of starvation to death. It's a fast,'' he said. A court appeal is planned for early this week, and the two ministers told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Buffalo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday they would continue the fast until they were released. The newspaper said <PERSON> Cadwallader </PERSON> has dropped to 170 pounds from 190 pounds; <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> has dropped to 222 from 245. `` I'll go as long as the Lord wants me to,'' said <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>.

<DATELINE>FORT SMITH, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 School officials have removed from a workbook a page that asked elementary special education pupils to pretend to be criminals. One youngster drew a picture of himself behind bars and wrote that murder was his make-believe crime. The <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> received a complaint about the exercise, which was deemed of questionable usefulness and will not be repeated, said deputy superintendent <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>. <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> said the assignment was only recently brought to the district's attention. The workbook was distributed in October to five special education pupils at <ORGANIZATION> Sunnymede </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, he said Friday. The deleted exercise read: `` Did you ever think about doing something terrible? Pretend that you did it. Describe the crime you committed, and make your own mug shot and fingerprints.'' An adult found one youngster's drawing and response, and questioned <PERSON> Sunnymede </PERSON> <PERSON> Principal </PERSON> <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiswall </PERSON> about it. Ms. <PERSON> Wiswall </PERSON> would not comment about the exercise Friday. The student, a third-grader, had drawn a picture of himself in jail, looking forlorn with a cigarette dangling from his mouth. Above the drawing, he listed his make-believe crime: `` Murder.'' It was graded `` C.'' The exercise was contained in a work called `` Anti-Coloring Book-Pad 2,'' which encourages creative coloring and is used as a supplemental text. No other assignments in the book were considered offensive and the book will continue to be used, <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> said. The teacher who assigned the exercise will not be reprimanded, <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> said. `` We -LRB- the school administration -RRB- agree this was not in good judgment,'' he said. `` I think the publisher should not have put that particular exercise in there.'' A spokesman for the book's publisher, <ORGANIZATION> Scholastic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Book </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>, said Friday that the book is no longer published by the company.

<HEAD>Venezuela Will Suspend Debt Payments Wednesday, Official Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> this week will suspend capital and interest payments on its private-sector debt, a banking official was quoted as saying Sunday. Venezuelan <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> was quoted by the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nacional </ORGANIZATION> as saying it will stop making the payments on Wednesday. Afterwards, he said, the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> nation's private-sector debt will be renegotiated `` as a block'' together with <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>'s public sector's refinanced debt of $ 20.3 billion In January, pressed by declining oil export revenue and shrinking international monetary reserves, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> suspended principal payments over its public sector's debt. Officials of the new social democratic government that took power in early February have held preliminary contacts with creditor banks to reschedule the country's refinanced debt over a period of 20-25 years, up from current 14 years, fixed interest rates and a grace period of six to eight years. <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> owes a total of $ 33 billion abroad and ranks fourth among Latin American debtors after <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>. The private sector's debt had been regularly served so far and the decision afects $ 472 million in principal due this year. Under current agreements, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> was to pay private sector obligations over the next three years, <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> said. `` It is not convenient to the nation to repay it in three years. We will place it as part of the ongoing renegotiation process -LRB- with foreign creditors -RRB-,'' he said. In total, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> paid last year more than $ 5 billion to its creditors. There were no immediate comments on the decision from the private sector or from banks, but when it was unofficially disclosed on Thursday some said such a move was expected given the new government's hardening stand on foreign debt problems. <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> said part of the Venezuelan strategy with its creditors points at reducing the nation's total debt by buying part of it at the secondary markets. There it is rated at less than a half its face value. `` We are studying a series of concrete and realistic possibilities,'' he said without elaborating. The official announcement over the private sector debt came as the nation is negotiating an agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> that will allow <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> financial support from the multilateral institution and fresh loans from creditor banks.

<TEXT>
 A Roman Catholic archbishop has been given a helicopter, but his plan to use it to travel in the 8,300-square-mile Archdiocese of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> has brought out safety concerns and criticism of the expense. Archbishop <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahony </PERSON>, who earned a helicopter pilot's license last summer, wants to use the $ 395,000 Hughes 389D for visits in his archdiocese, which sprawls over <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ventura </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION> counties The 7-year-old helicopter was donated by a group organized by <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Riordan </PERSON>, a close friend of the archbishop. The gift includes maintenance, operating costs and insurance. Several Catholic high schools and two seminaries have been directed to prepare landing pads, and landing rights are being sought downtown. <PERSON> Mahony </PERSON>, whose 53rd birthday is Monday, lives downtown at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vibiana </ORGANIZATION>'s Cathedral. The gift has been criticized by advocates for the poor. `` The problems and needs of the homeless ... and the refugee and immigrant populations far exceed what is being done by the diocese,'' said <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the Catholic Worker organization. `` If he is going to set a good example, he'd say ` Thank you very much' and give it back. The gift also has generated concern among some aviation experts because of the skill needed to fly a helicopter and the complexity of <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> airspace. Insurance restrictions prevent <PERSON> Mahony </PERSON> from flying alone, so an instructor will fly with him. But some pilots said a novice at the controls of a helicopter might not be a good idea in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>' crowded skies `` He could be asking for a lot of trouble,'' said Capt. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> chaplain who is licensed to fly a helicopter and also holds a commercial pilot's license and instructor certificate. `` Flying a helicopter is no easy task. He has a lot to offer the church and it might be better for him to just get a driver and sit and do his work in the back of the car.'' <PERSON> Mahony </PERSON> would not comment. A news conference about the helicopter was scheduled for Tuesday, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, executive director of communications for the archdiocese. Elsewhere in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the dioceses of <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION> and Fairbanks, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, and Gallup, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, own airplanes used by bishops and priests to cover expansive, rugged terrain.

 A Soviet-born Israeli who allegedly gave military secrets to the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and asked for $ 1.5 million in return was indicted Sunday before a <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> court, <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> reported. The indictment accused <PERSON> Binyamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Shenkman </PERSON>, 35, of giving <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> secret information on the Israeli army during three trips to <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> in 1988, the radio said. He also offered to fly to <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> and hold a press conference where he would answer questions on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s military capabilities and publically tear up his <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> passport, it said <PERSON> Shenkman </PERSON> demanded $ 1.5 million from the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> in return for his actions, the radio said. But he was never paid and police arrested him at the airport when he returned from <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>. The radio said <PERSON> Shenkman </PERSON> moved to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in 1978 and served in the army for four months in 1985. Details of the information disclosed by <PERSON> Shenkman </PERSON> and his role in the military have been banned from publication. It is unusual, however, for a new immigrant who has served only a short time in the military to be given a position in which he works with sensitive information. The radio had previously quoted <PERSON> Shenkman </PERSON>, whose name was first released Sunday, as saying his actions were motivated in part by his disillusionment with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> after immigrating. `` I ask that you take into consideration that all my life I only wanted to come to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, and here I suffered.'' the radio quoted <PERSON> Shenkman </PERSON> as telling the court after he his arrest. `` There were people who embittered my life every day and each hour,'' he said. The radio did not elaborate. The court has not yet set a date for <PERSON> Shenkman </PERSON>'s trial. A 1986 law bans unauthorized meetings with members of a terrorist group. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> views the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> as a such a group. Charges of espionage carry a maximun 30-year prison sentence. <PERSON> Shenkman </PERSON>'s is the second case of alleged espionage involving a Soviet emigre. On Dec. 15, <PERSON> Shabtai </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalmanovich </PERSON>, 45, was sentenced to nine years in prison on charges of spying for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and having contacts with a foreign agent.

<HEAD>Tower Takes On Allegations of Drinking and Womanizing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 It was an extraordinary live TV exchange _ a prominent former senator taking on direct allegations that he was a `` common ... drunk'' and womanizer. Especially so, for a Sunday morning `` talk show.'' By the time it was over, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> had acknowledged a fondness for Scotch whisky 12 years ago, but said he was never an alcoholic, has imbibed only modestly in recent years and promised not to take a single drink if he wins confirmation as secretary of defense. He challenged his interrogators to define `` womanizer.'' One of them, a woman, countered only that women know one when they see one. At any rate, Tower declined to extend his tee-total pledge to women. `` I am a single man,'' he protested when asked to say whether he would do so. All this from one of the president's closest advisers _ a man formerly referred to in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> jargon as `` my distinguished colleague,'' a former arms-control negotiator and appointee to presidential commissions. The exchange Sunday on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` This Week With <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkley </PERSON>'' marked Tower's debut in his uphill fight to win full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation as President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s defense secretary. He later made the same presentation on <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>. Tower said at the start of the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> program that he was happy to be able to `` break my silence'' on the character allegations that have swirled around him since his nomination. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which he once chaired as a senator from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, recommended against his confirmation on Thursday. Sunday's television interview by <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON>, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Will </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cokie </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> quickly bore into the nitty-gritty details of his personal life. Tower did not shrink from it. <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON> asked him about, `` to put it rather inelegantly, the charge that you're a common, or uncommon, drunk.'' In response, Tower read a doctor's letter testifying that his liver `` shows no evidence at all of alcoholic impairment or alcoholism'' and that there appeared no alcohol-related impairment to his being defense secretary. He went on to make a formal pledge he said he hopes will remove the main obstacle to his confirmation: `` Let me state that I have never been an alcoholic nor dependent on alcohol. However, to allay any fears or doubts on this matter, I hereby swear and undertake that if confirmed, during the course of my tenure as secretary of <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION>, I will not consume beverage alcohol of any type or form, including wine, beer or spirits of any kind.'' <PERSON> Will </PERSON> told him, `` It is fairly well on the record that at one point in the 70s, you drank more than even you think you should have.'' Tower: `` Oh, yes. I did.'' Will: `` Was there a point prior to this pledge ... at which you ... could point to and say, ` There, I changed.''' Tower: `` Yes. Twelve years, I gave up spirits. I used to be a pretty good scotch drinker. And I gave up, I have n't tasted scotch in 12 years. `` After that, I had only wine. Had perhaps an occasional martini, occasionally a little vodka with smoked salmon or caviar or something like that. But that was just occasionally. I really essentially have been a wine drinker. And now, my only consumption is wine at meals. I do n't drink wine even unless I'm eating.'' Talk later returned to the pledge when <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON> said: `` By making that pledge today, it seems to me you're admitting you have a drinking problem.'' Tower: `` I anticipated that question, <PERSON> Sam </PERSON>, because, in vetting this with some of my friends, they said that's the spin that would be put on it. ... I said in the statement that I am not an alcoholic nor have I ever been dependent on alcohol.'' <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON>: `` Then why would you make a pledge when you say there's no reason to?'' Tower: `` Well, why not make it? It's a small thing to do to allay doubts and fears. ...'' <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON>: `` If you say there's no reason to do it. ... Now, when allegations are raised that you're a womanizer, should you take a pledge not to go out with women?'' Tower: `` I'm a single man. I do date women. ... I've been a single man for 3 -LCB- years.'' <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON> persisted. `` What is your definition of ` womanizing,' <PERSON> Sam </PERSON>?'' Tower asked at one point. `` Womanize is a broad term. What is your definition of the term?'' <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON>: `` I do n't know.'' Tower: `` Well, all right ... <PERSON> Cokie </PERSON>, do you have a definition of the term?'' <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>: `` Well, I think most women have a _ know it when they see it, Senator.'' Tower: `` But, you still ca n't define it.'' Subsequently encountering a group of reporters off camera, <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> said he could live with the scrutiny that ultimately forced former Sen. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> out of last year's presidential race. Asked in light of his alcohol pledge if he would invite reporters to follow him as did <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> amid rumors he was unfaithful to his wife, Tower replied, `` Look. A secretary of defense lives in a goldfish bowl. If anybody wants to put a tail on me, they can.''

<TEXT>
 The last three British minehunters in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> leave for home Monday, closing another chapter in the Western naval commitment to protect shipping lanes during the Iran-Iraq war. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said Sunday in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> that the HMS <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> HMS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiddingfold </ORGANIZATION> and HMS Cottesmore would take about three weeks to reach their home port of <LOCATION> Rosyth </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Edinburgh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> HMS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>, an ocean survey ship serving as support vessel for the mine-clearing trio, left earlier this month and another auxiliary ship, <LOCATION> HMS </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diligence </LOCATION>, will depart with the minehunters, the ministry said. The withdrawal, first announced more than a month ago, was unrelated to a renewed call by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> during the weekend for all foreign warships to leave the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> now that a cease-fire between <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has remained in effect for six months. The minehunters' departure leaves the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Armilla Patrol,'' consisting of three frigates and a support ship, to represent British seapower in the gulf. Officials say there are no plans to withdraw the patrol. It also leaves the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> virtually alone with the task of further mine-clearing in the strategic waterway. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officers estimate there may still be as many as 150 to 200 mines laid by both sides in the gulf. Six wooden-hulled <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> minesweepers, dispatched to the gulf in late 1987 and still on duty, are the last foreign ships based in the waterway equipped to deal with mines. The Iranian navy claims it has cleared <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s coastal waters, but these do not include the gulf's main shipping lanes, where the mine threat was greatest. The mines occasionally break loose from their underwater moorings and drift into shipping lanes. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and British naval officers put little stock in the Iranian claims because they do not believe the Iranian navy is equipped to clear mines. Neither <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> nor <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> is known to have offered to provide charts of its minefields, particularly in the northern gulf. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> were among seven Western countries that sent warships to the gulf, or reinforced units already there, in 1987 to protect shipping caught in the escalating `` tanker war,'' a spinoff of the Iran-Iraq conflict. The conflict included a spate of incidents involving Iranian-laid mines. While foreign navies have been scaling back since <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> agreed to a truce Aug. 20, there were indications that the withdrawal of British minehunters amounted to a policy reversal. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldegrave </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s Minister of State for Foreign and <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> Affairs, told a news conference in <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> Oct. 23 that the anti-mine force was likely to have `` a continuing role for a good many years.'' During a visit to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> Saturday, Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> was prepared to remove its forces. His remarks were seen as aimed chiefly at the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which has reduced its force by four warships since the cease-fire but still has 23 in the region, including 14 in the gulf. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say that while force size is tailored to the threat at any given time, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> intends to continue its 40-year naval presence in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>WASH: a moment.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> MR. </PERSON> <PERSON> DONALDSON </PERSON>: We're back with former Senator <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>. Senator, let's go back to your relationship with the defense industry. Now, you were a consultant for them for about two years, we've discussed that. A lot of people wonder whether coming back to the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> and trying to cut the budget and take a hard look at overruns and other abuses of defense contracting, whether you're the right man to do it. They say, you're in the defense industry's pocket SEN. TOWER: Well, that's an allegation that is untrue. I am not in the defense industry's pocket. Let me point out one thing: any suggestion that I would be inordinately influenced by the industry falls on the basis of my past record and performance. When I was chairman of the president's special review board, the so-called `` <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>,'' at the time I was asked to be chairman of that, I was no more loyal to anybody than <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. I was enormously loyal to him. And yet, I did my work objectively and thoroughly, along with my two colleagues on that commission. And I think I received universal approval from the mass media on my objectivity, and the critical nature of that report. Now, to suggest that I'm going to be inordinately loyal to people that I have no connection with, had no particular loyalty to in the first place, except to the extent that I was bound to give them my best judgment on issues. <PERSON> MR. </PERSON> <PERSON> DONALDSON </PERSON>: Do you think _ SEN. TOWER: I think my past performance and my proven record of integrity in public office speaks for itself. And I do n't think I have to apologize for it. <PERSON> MR. </PERSON> <PERSON> DONALDSON </PERSON>: Do you think you need to recuse yourself? SEN. TOWER: No, no _ well, I've already said I would recuse myself on issues of suspension or disbarment, and that's enormously important. The law does n't even require me to do that. Now, if you follow the Nunn-Warner criteria for what you want in a <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official, not just the secretary of defense, but subordinate officials in the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> _ the deputy, the undersecretary for acquisition _ it says they should be people experienced in defense. And they anticipate, and I think Senator <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> has said, that we expect to get people out of industry. Now, my deputy who's coming on, <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwood </PERSON> from <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION>, presided over <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION>, which is a part of the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> complex. Now, is he to be considered inordinately influenced by the defense industry? Now, you're going to have to go back and rewrite the Nunn-Warner criteria. You have to bring people out of industry. People who've been in industry, as long as they're people of honesty and integrity, who know the process, are the ones best qualified to save you money, to make sure that your acquisition procedures are efficient and economical and honest. <PERSON> MR. </PERSON> WILL: Senator, I have two questions, one political and one personal. On the political question, you've counted a lot of votes in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, and you must be looking at the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> now. Are you going to win? And do you assume, in doing so, that you're going to get 45 Republican votes? SEN. TOWER: I think I have to follow Senator <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s assessment of that, and that is that the Republicans will stick by me. I have many friends among the Democrats. And I think that I have removed the principal cause for concern here today that most of them have expressed. I think, as you note, a lot of the members of the committee itself said that they were inclined to support me _ Senator <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> said so earlier on this show _ until this concern was raised. So, removing this concern I think gives me an opportunity, not only to pick up Democrats off the committee, but to pick up Democrats on the committee. I hope that it will be accepted by Senator <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, that he would change his mind. Senator <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> and I agree for the most part on most policy issues and I think we'll have a very good working relationship. MR. WILL: This ca n't have been any fun for you the last three months. Have you ever, just as a human interest side of this story, have you ever decided that this is too much cost to you or your family and you'd like to get out? SEN. TOWER: It's already been costly to my family. Every time a new allegation appeared on television that I was keeping a Soviet ballerina in an apartment in <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oaks </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> and off the wall stuff like this, I would get calls from my daughters in virtual tears. I have three daughters. And they'd call me on a daily basis. This has been enormously difficult for them. It's also been difficult for people that I've been associated with who have been trampled in the rush to get at me. I think some innocent people have suffered. Some women on my staff have suffered and unjustly so. So, that's also been a difficult thing for me to bear because when people go after you, very often, they do n't care if they trample a few innocent people in the process and that's been done in this case. <PERSON> MS. </PERSON> <PERSON> ROBERTS </PERSON>: But Senator, it's your own former committee. Why do you think it's happening to you? SEN. TOWER: Well, I think it's because of the honest concerns raised by Senator <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>. I really think I answered that question earlier. Most of the Democrats said they were inclined to vote for me earlier. But because of the concerns raised by the chairman, they changed their minds. And there is that loyalty to the chairman. So I think that as we progress with this, I would like to see the level of the rhetoric lowered, I'd like to see it cooled off. I've always had a good relationship with <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> And I think we can restore confidence in the Pentagon with solid <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> cooperation, not only with Senator <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, but with other appropriate leaders and committees of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. And I think having been through this, that it will go a long way toward restoring public confidence if I have proven my ability to cooperate. MR. WILL: Senator, you were warmly recommended to the committee by Senator <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. Do you think that an inference from that is that he may be one of your supporters? SEN. TOWER: I'm not going to try to predict how any individual senator can _ will vote. Senator <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and I worked together for 14 years in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, and although we are of differing _ different parties, we never had a cross word with each other, and always in the interests of our state and the nation, we cooperated. <PERSON> MR. </PERSON> <PERSON> DONALDSON </PERSON>: Senator _ SEN. TOWER: So, I do n't know how he'll vote, but he obviously, from his presentation, felt at the time he made that presentation that I was highly qualified. <PERSON> MR. </PERSON> <PERSON> DONALDSON </PERSON>: Senator, going back to your no drinking pledge. If you're confirmed, what's the penalty? If you should take a drink as secretary of defense, would you think that you should then resign? SEN. TOWER: I think I'd be obliged to resign if I broke a pledge. I've never broken a pledge in my life. <PERSON> MR. </PERSON> <PERSON> DONALDSON </PERSON>: All right. Thank you very much, Senator Tower. We do appreciate your coming in here today.

<HEAD>Labor Group Says Romania Uses Beatings, Jail To Intimidate Unionists</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Romanian officials frequently resort to beatings and imprisonments to prevent workers from forming independent trade unions, a report by a worldwide labor organization said Monday. The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Confederation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unions </ORGANIZATION> said it was sending its 20-page report on <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s labor strife to the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> labor arm. The report said police arrested three of 34 people who discussed setting up an independent union at an arms plant in <LOCATION> Zarnesti </LOCATION> on June 26, 1988. The three were dismissed from the plant and two of them were beaten while in detention, it added. The labor group said this occurred less than a year after police used force to end a rally by students in <LOCATION> Brasov </LOCATION> in support of a strike at a plant there a week earlier. The report also expresses concern about the treatment, including long prison sentences in recent years, for 20 people who sought support for better working and living conditions in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>. `` Imprisonment, beatings, disappearances, discrimination and dismissals are among the arsenal of repressive measures used by the Romanian authrities in their dealings with free trade unionists,'' the labor group's secretary-general, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Vanderveken </PERSON>, said in a letter to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> organization. The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Confederation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unions </ORGANIZATION> is a coalition of 87 million workers in 141 affiliated organizations worldwide.

Opposition parties accuse the governing <ORGANIZATION> Anguilla </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> of breaking its own policy of prohibiting foreigners from owning more than half an acre of residential property on this 35-square mile island inhabited by 7,000 people. <PERSON> Norris </PERSON>, a frequent visitor, bought three quarters of an acre on the island's west side in 1985 and built a holiday mansion there.

 Miners in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> province decided Sunday to continue their strike until they receive written assurances that three regional <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> officials will resign, the state news agency said. More than 1,000 miners, most of them Albanians, at the <ORGANIZATION> Trepca </ORGANIZATION> lead and zinc mine have been striking since Monday to press for changes in the regional leadership and to protest the <LOCATION> Serbian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>'s plans for greater control of <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>, one of its two autonomous provinces. After intensive bargaining Saturday night and Sunday, the miners decided to continue their strike until they receive written assurances that <ORGANIZATION> Kosovo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON> <PERSON> Morina </PERSON> and two other local officials, <PERSON> Husamedin </PERSON> <PERSON> Azemi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Sukrija </PERSON>, will step down, the <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> news agency said. The three leaders, ethnic Albanians, are considered by the miners to be pro-Serbian politicians. Earlier in the day, <PERSON> Bashkim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hisari </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> party presidium member, told reporters that the miners' requests would be discussed `` in a tolerant dialogue'' if they leave their mine at <LOCATION> Titova </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mitrovica </LOCATION>, 125 miles south of <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> said at least 550 exhausted miners have requested medical assistance, and one was reported in critical condition. <PERSON> Ilijaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Nimani </PERSON>, 42, one of the hospitalized miners, told <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> that `` When I recover I will join my comrades in the pits. We plan to stay there until we die because the Albanians are losing their rights.'' He said <LOCATION> Serbian </LOCATION> authorities want to close Albanian-language schools and the university in the province, where ethnic Albanians are a majority. A striking miner was quoted by <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Belgrade </ORGANIZATION> Sunday as saying: `` I prefer to die in the pit than at home.'' `` If nothing is resolved, we have our plans,'' the miner added. He refused to elaborate. <PERSON> Riza </PERSON> <PERSON> Muslimi </PERSON>, a spokesman for the striking miners, said Saturday they had stashed two tons of explosives underground, but he would not say whether they intended to use them to demolish the shaft if their demands were not met. The protesters have condemned <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>'s drive to gain greater control over <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> by changing the constitution, fearing they would lose the wide autonomy granted to them in 1974. The constitutional change would give <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION> greater control over <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> and its other province, <LOCATION> Vojvodina </LOCATION>, and increase its powers over defense and state security. The proposed change was approved by <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION> on Thursday, but the amendments must also be approved by the provincial assemblies. Serbian leaders say they must have more control in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> to protect the mainly <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Slav </PERSON> minority from alleged persecution by predominantly Moslem ethnic <PERSON> Albanians </PERSON>, who make up 85 percent of the province's population. In November, up to 100,000 ethnic Albanians demonstrated in <LOCATION> Pristina </LOCATION> for five days to protest the dismissal of senior provincial officials as demanded by <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>'s leaders. <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Yugoslav </LOCATION> leaders have told the protesters the proposed constitutional changes do not mean a reduction of <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>'s autonomy

 Soldiers shot and killed an <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> during a tax collection raid Sunday, and a masked Palestinian shot and wounded a hospital official suspected of collaborating with the Israelis, army and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. Another Palestinian man was reported wounded in a clash between soldiers and stone-throwers at a refugee camp. The army began enforcing a new policy requiring <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> to buy special stickers for their cars to drive into <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. A military spokesman said the practice will bar several hundred of about 25,000 Arab-owned vehicles from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> he saw no need to `` rush into'' devising a <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace plan before he visits <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for talks with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in April, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio reported. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> spoke during a review of his meetings last week with <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> leaders in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and talks in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> between <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> and his Israeli counterpart, <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON>. The meetings failed to break a deadlock over <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s rejection of Soviet proposals for an international peace conference and for direct negotiations with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. In Jewish <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, suspected Palestinian nationalists stoned a bus in the center of the city, wounding one Israeli, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said. Police detained a 16-year-old suspect for questioning. In <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, police uncovered a seven-member squad of Palestinians who belonged to the Popular Front for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine-General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, a radical group headed by <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON>, the radio reported. The squad lived in Arab villages inside <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The group had cameras and electronic equipment, but details of their activities are banned from publication. In <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> in the crowded seaside <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, toops shot and killed 20-year-old <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Abed </PERSON> <PERSON> Muharram </PERSON> when stone-throwing youths confronted tax collectors during a raid at a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> home, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. Withholding of taxes has been a frequently used tactic during the uprising. The army said it was checking the report. The death raised to 386 the number of Palestinians killed in the revolt against the Israeli occupation of the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. Seventeen Israelis, including six soldiers, also have died. Also in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, a masked Palestinian walked into the government-run <ORGANIZATION> Shifa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> and shot deputy director <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rauf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilles </PERSON> in the head for being a suspected collaborator, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. An army spokesman confirmed the shooting and said <PERSON> Hilles </PERSON> was transferred to an Israeli hospital. The national <ORGANIZATION> Itim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Hilles </PERSON>, 35, was in charge of security at <LOCATION> Shifa </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> said he personally guarded an Israeli medical officer. At least 60 Arabs killed during the uprising have been slain by fellow Palestinians who suspect them of collaborating with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials, said Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>. The other wounding in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> involved a 30-year-old man shot in the wrist during a clash in Shati refugee camp, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. The car sticker policy requires Palestinians to have their police records checked before they can purchase a sticker. A military spokesman said each sticker costs 10 shekels, about $ 5.50. The average monthly wage for Palestinians is 400 to 500 shekels. Arab reporters said stickers will be denied Palestinians who have not paid taxes. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, soldiers arrested dozens of suspects during searches for the Palestinian who killed Israeli reserve Sgt. <PERSON> Binyamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meisner </PERSON>, the radio said. <PERSON> Meisner </PERSON> died Friday when someone dropped a concrete block on his head. <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said troops blew up a house near the site of the attack and a room in an adjacent house. A third home in the area was sealed shut, the reports said. Soldiers maintained a curfew on most of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>' 120,000 residents for a third straight day. Dr. <PERSON> Amir </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Masri </PERSON>, an obstetrician at <LOCATION> Al </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ittihad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, said the curfew prevented most of the medical staff from reporting to work and that only 24 doctors and nurses out of 145 arrived Sunday. <PERSON> Al-Masri </PERSON> also said the hospital lacked fresh meat and vegetables to feed its patients. Only one of four ambulances was permitted to operate, other <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. Military sources denied the reports and said doctors are allowed free access to the area, despite the curfew. They added that there are no shortages of food in the city.

 The publisher of `` The Satanic Verses'' is willing to talk with Moslems and would consider canceling the paperback edition to defuse the controversy over the novel, a newspaper said Sunday. Thousands of Shiite Moslems demonstrated in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in support of <PERSON> Ayathollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s demand that the book's British author, <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, be killed A man claiming to represent an Arab group said the furor over the novel could delay the release of foreign hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> has been in hiding, reportedly under police guard in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, since <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> issued his death sentence Feb. 14. <PERSON> Viking </PERSON> <PERSON> Penguin </PERSON> published the hardcover edition of `` The Satanic Verses'' in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in September, and the paperback edition is due out in fall. Some say the book insults Islam. The <ORGANIZATION> Sunday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Viking </PERSON> <PERSON> Penguin </PERSON> might rule out a paperback version if British Moslems call off their protest and try to persuade Islamic nations to do the same. Penguin also is willing to consider labeling the remaining unsold hardcover copies with a warning that says the book is a work of fiction, the newspaper reported, without citing sources. Efforts to reach the publishers failed Sunday, as offices were closed and no one answered the telephone. British writers at a Writers Guild seminar in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> unanimously supported <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> on Sunday. `` We call upon world opinion to support the right of all people to express their ideas and beliefs,'' the group said in a statement. `` We request all world leaders to continue to repudiate the threats made against <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> and his publishers, and to take firm action to ensure that these threats are withdrawn,'' it said. The Council for Mosques in <LOCATION> Bradford </LOCATION>, home of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s largest Moslem population, called for a boycott of all Viking Penguin publications at a meeting Sunday. More than 60,000 Moslems live in the northern <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> community, where demonstrators have burned copies of <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s book. The 41-year-old <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, born into a Moslem family in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, apologized for any distress his novel caused, but <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> rejected the apology. About 5,000 Pro-Iranian Shiite Moslems burned effigies of <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> during a march in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, on Sunday. Leading the march were 20 members of <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, who wore white death shrouds inscribed in English and Arabic, `` We are ready to kill <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>.'' Shiite suicide squads usually don death robes before going out on missions. The Iranian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> is believed to be the parent organization of Shiite factions that hold most of the 15 foreign hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. In the ancient eastern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Baalbek </LOCATION>, protesters carried banners signed `` Islamic Jihad,'' or Islamic holy war, in support of the death threat. Islamic Jihad is a <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> group holding two <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> hostages, including <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. The longest-held hostage, he was kidnapped March 16, 1985. A man claiming to speak for a previously unknown group, `` The <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> in the World,'' said the furor over `` The Satanic Verses'' and the West's angry reaction to <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s death threat will delay the release of the hostages There was no way to authenticate the claim, made by an anonymous caller who telephoned a Western news agency in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The man, who spoke Arabic, said the group had ordered its members to assassinate <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> between Feb. 27 and March 15. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> television reported thousands of Moslems also demonstrated in the Iranian holy city of <LOCATION> Qom </LOCATION>, chanting `` We are at your service <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'' and `` Death to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>!'' In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, a Moslem leader denied reports his mosque was being used as a base to train Moslems in terrorist attacks. A senior <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, made the allegation Saturday and said the training was under way at Islamic cultural centers in <LOCATION> Bradford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Leicester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. The chief imam at the <ORGANIZATION> Manchester </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mosque </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasar </PERSON> <PERSON> Beg </PERSON> said: `` I'm sorry, I do n't know anything about that.'' Many Moslems say the book insults Islam by portraying the wives of the prophet <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> as prostitutes and suggesting he wrote the Koran, the Moslem holy book, rather than receiving it from God.

 Firefighters drove bulldozers and other heavy equipment Sunday into a tire dump fire to keep the blaze from spreading, and residents near the dump began returning to their homes. About 200 families were evacuated Saturday night and authorities allowed them to return home Sunday. But residents were advised to stay indoors to avoid the dense chemical smoke. Officials said the fire was likely to burn for several days, but <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Tompkins </PERSON>, president of the <LOCATION> Catskill </LOCATION> fire company, said he thought the fire was contained. The cause of the fire was unknown. The dump holds about 2 million tires, and about half of them caught fire. The bulldozers were used to separate the mounds of tires. Smoke from the blaze could be seen 40 miles north in <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>. Federal officials tested air samples and determined there was no immediate health threat, said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> June </PERSON>, chief of the <LOCATION> Catskill </LOCATION> fire company.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, calling the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` a faithful friend and a dependable ally'' of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, said Monday he has no plans to reduce <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops stationed in this strife-torn nation, the last stop on a whirlwind five-day Asian tour. `` They will remain in the <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> as long as they are needed and as long as we believe it is in the interest of peace,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in remarks prepared for a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> arrived at a private military airfield amid unusually stringent security because of a rash of recent anti-American demonstrations. The president made no mention of the often-violent protests in his prepared remarks, but focused on the history of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military presence that Korean radicals want removed. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> headed here after a two-day visit to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, whose troops fought on the side of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> in that 1950s conflict. In 1950, when North Korean forces invaded the south, `` without hesitation or delay, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> forces rushed to your aid. Together, Americans and <LOCATION> Koreans </LOCATION> fought side-by-side for your right to determine your own future,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` I remember the devastation of your country. Your cities lay in rubble. Your factories were in shambles. Millions of your people wandered the streets homeless and hungry.'' While in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, the president stressed new, much-improved <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> relations with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. But his upbeat visit was marred by harassment of a leading dissident. The dissident, astrophysicist <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> <PERSON> Lizhi </PERSON>, said his efforts to attend a farewell banquet hosted by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> were repeatedly frustrated by police, even though he and his wife had been invited by the president. White House officials said Monday that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> voiced regret over the incident just before leaving <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Talking to reporters aboard <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> One as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> headed to <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` expressed regret'' over the incident in a brief chat with the Chinese Vice Premier <PERSON> Wu </PERSON> <PERSON> Xueqian </PERSON> at the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> airport just before boarding his plane. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not learn of the incident until Monday morning. He said that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also asked <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Lord </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, to get `` full details'' of the incident. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> also said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> felt that `` quiet diplomacy'' was the best way to pursue the human rights issue with Chinese leaders. `` The president feels that the visit was successful,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. But he added that `` there are problems on both sides, of course.'' <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s capital has been buffeted in recent weeks by violent anti-American demonstrations as radical students demanded that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases be moved. A security force 120,000-strong was mobilized to guard <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> during his five-hour visit against threats, both from student radicals and from North Korean commandos. In his speech, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> likened the <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, `` full of noise, contention and emotion.'' `` But that is the sound of democracy at work,'' he said. `` Throughout, let our close economic and strategic relationship remain as it is _ a pillar of peace in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>.'' But, while calling <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> a `` world class economic power,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> cited recent trade frictions between the two nations. He called on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to do more to lower its barriers to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> products, citing the large <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit with the nation and declaring: `` Protectionism is fool's gold.'' However, the main thrust of the president's remarks dealt with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops. `` Our most important mission together is to maintain the freedom and democracy you fought so hard to win,'' he said. `` I have come here today as the leader of a faithful friend and a dependable ally ... There are no plans to reduce <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>.'' `` Our soldiers and airmen are there at the request of the Republic of <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and their presence contributes to the peace and stability of northeast <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>.'' At the same time, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> voiced support for South Korean President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-Woo </PERSON>'s `` peaceful initiatives ... to build bridges to the North.'' Earlier, <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s national security adviser, said, `` There's been a lot of unrest. There's been an anti-American tone to some of it.'' `` One of the reasons the president is going there is to reassure the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Koreans </LOCATION> of our support for their moves toward democracy and of the firmness of our strategic relationships,'' Scowcroft said. Of the incident involving the Chinese dissident, <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> said, `` The president, of course, would hope that all of his guests would be allowed to attend'' the U.S.-hosted banquet. <PERSON> Fang </PERSON>, holding a news conference in the hotel filing center used by reporters covering <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s visit, said the car he was riding in was stopped by police several blocks from the banquet site. Then, he said, another officer prevented him from walking to the site and when he attempted to get to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassy to complain, his taxi was stopped and buses were prevented from picking him up. Holding his invitations aloft, he declined to directly criticize <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for not raising human rights issues in his talks with Chinese leaders. But, he said, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should n't hold <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to a lesser standard than it holds the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` I've thought many times that democracy is a common concept all over the world,'' he said. The event at issue was a banquet at which <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> served his guests <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> barbecue. Presidential spokesman <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> <PERSON> Popadiuk </PERSON> said `` the issue of human rights was not raised per se'' in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s talks. Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said the matter was discussed on lower levels, including his own talks with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s foreign minister `` It has n't been done with big public fanfare and a lot of noise. Frankly we think that sometimes you make better progress with human rights when it's done quietly and low-key,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` Face The Nation. `` I think the message got through loud and clear,'' he said. Although the president alluded to the subject in a speech at a banquet Saturday night, most of his words in this capital have been filled with praise for Chinese leaders.

 Police blocked <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s leading dissident from attending a banquet held by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Sunday. White House officials said that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> voiced regret over the incident just before leaving the country. After preventing <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> <PERSON> Lizhi </PERSON> from attending a dinner that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> hosted at the Sheraton Great Wall Hotel, police tailed the dissident for an hour and a half after ordering a taxi and a bus not to pick him up. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had invited <PERSON> Fang </PERSON>, an internationally respected astrophysicist, as a gesture of support for Chinese intellectuals who have called for greater political freedom, White House officials said. Talking to reporters aboard <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> One as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> headed to <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` expressed regret'' over the incident in a brief chat at the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> airport just before the president boarded his executive jet. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> raised the issue with Chinese Vice Premier <PERSON> Wu </PERSON> <PERSON> Xueqian </PERSON>, the highest-ranking <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> official to see the president off after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s two-day visit. <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> was one of five human rights activists invited to the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> Texas-style barbecue dinner. The other four were allowed to attend. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not learn of the incident until Monday morning, just before he was to depart. He said that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also asked <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Lord </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, to get `` full details'' of the incident. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> also said that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> felt that `` quiet diplomacy'' was the best way to pursue the human rights issue with Chinese leaders. `` The president feels that the visit was successful,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. But he added that `` there are problems on both sides, of course.'' <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> said in a telephone interview, `` This really shows <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s attitude toward human rights. He described the police action as `` weak and scared'' and added, `` All I wanted to do was shake the hands of the president and Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' As the banquet ended, a reporter yelled, `` Mr. President, what about human rights?'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> smiled but did not answer. White House National security adviser <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> said later, `` Well the president, of course, would hope that all of his guests would be allowed to attend the dinner, of course.'' The police action came about an hour after <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support of Chinese activism could harm relations between the countries. <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Link </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, said he and his wife were driving <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Shuxian </PERSON>, to the banquet when police stopped them several blocks away for an alleged traffic violation. They walked to the hotel, but outside the entrance `` suddenly a swarm of plainclothes policemen surrounded us, pulling <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> <PERSON> Lizhi </PERSON> and his wife and me and my wife apart,'' <PERSON> Link </PERSON> said. He said the officers told <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> he was not on the guest list. The official guest list distributed at the banquet included <PERSON> Fang </PERSON>'s name. The couples then walked to a nearby hotel to get a taxi, but police stopped the taxi from picking up the group and then flagged down a bus and ordered it to drive by the four, <PERSON> Link </PERSON> said. The four walked an hour and a half to Lord's residence, and were followed all the way by police, some plainclothes officers and others in marked cars, <PERSON> Link </PERSON> said. A Canadian diplomat saw them outside the locked residence and drove them to his home, <PERSON> Link </PERSON> said. `` I was astounded by the scope of the net that had been put out for us,'' <PERSON> Link </PERSON> said. He said he discussed the problem with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, but embassy officials denied Link spoke to them. Several hours later, <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> held an impromptu news conference at a <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> hotel. He refused to criticize <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for not pressing Chinese authorities to correct human rights abuses, saying, `` I have no comment because he is just beginning.'' However, he said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should not hold the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to one human rights standard and other countries to another. With his wife, <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Shuxian </PERSON>, by his side, <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> said he had no plans to halt his calls for democracy. `` It's a normal thing to attend a banquet, but the authorities here are afraid of even that,'' <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> said, holding aloft his banquet tickets. Western diplomats said <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> authorities had put `` heavy pressure'' on <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> not to accept the banquet invitation. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said earlier that <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> was invited `` as an astrophysicist, an outstanding person in his field, and also because of his human rights stand.'' He said it was unlikely <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would have talked with <PERSON> Fang </PERSON>. <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> gained international prominence when he was blamed for inciting pro-democracy student demonstrations that spread throughout <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in early 1986 and 1987. He was expelled from the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and fired from his job as professor at an <LOCATION> Anhui </LOCATION> province university. He has since been transferred to a job at the <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> observatory. In recent months, <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> has led a renewed movement among Chinese intellectuals who want more democracy, greater artistic freedoms and amnesty for political prisoners. Earlier, <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> told <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> that Chinese advocates of Western-style democracy could cause the nation's economic reforms to fail, and he issued a warning about support in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for those seeking political reforms in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` Some personages in American society who support those people who are dissatisfied with the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government will not contribute to the stability of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s political situation and the undergoing of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s reform, nor will it be conducive to the friendship between <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> was quoted as saying by <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhaoxing </PERSON>. Playwright <PERSON> Wu </PERSON> <PERSON> Zuguang </PERSON>, a government critic who attended the banquet without interference, said, `` We all think this whole situation is very strange.'' `` It's strange and it's stupid,'' muttered <PERSON> Su </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaozhi </PERSON>, a leading Marxist theorist who has called for greater democracy and who also attended the banquet.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> tried to tiptoe around human rights problems in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, deciding not even to mention them, but they came looking for him. On the final night of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s visit, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s leading dissident, <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> <PERSON> Lizhi </PERSON> and his wife, were prevented by police from attending a banquet hosted by the president. They tried to get there by car, taxi and bus but were stopped at each point. Police cited minor traffic violations and ultimately incorrectly informed the pair they were not on the guest list. They had been invited as a gesture by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> toward Chinese intellectuals who are calling for greater political freedom. How did the White House react initially? Offering a mild mannered response, White House National security adviser <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> said, `` Well the president, of course, would hope that all of his guests would be allowed to attend the dinner, of course.'' But the White House reacted more strongly in private, according to press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. Talking to reporters as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> headed to <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` expressed regret'' over the incident privately during a brief chat at the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> airport with Chinese Vice Premier <PERSON> Wu </PERSON> <PERSON> Xueqian </PERSON>. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not learn of the incident until Monday morning, just before he was to depart. He said that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also asked <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Lord </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, to get `` full details'' of the incident. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> also said that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> felt that `` quiet diplomacy'' was the best way to pursue the human rights issue with Chinese leaders. `` The president feels that the visit was successful,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. But he added that `` there are problems on both sides, of course.'' But it was clear from the beginning that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was not going to make human rights a burning issue. On the day he flew to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he was not aware of whether he was supposed to be carrying a list of human rights concerns. He said he'd be briefed on the flight. `` Human rights was not discussed,'' White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> reported later as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> completed two days of talks with senior Chinese leaders. Before he left <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had received a letter from more than 40 members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> asking him to raise several human rights cases in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. Moreoever, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, long criticized as having its eyes closed to Chinese repression in <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>, recently joined in worldwide protest over treatment of ethnic Tibetans. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters Friday that `` both the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> know of our commitment to human rights. And it is beholden on any <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> president to reiterate our commitment to human rights.'' Despite <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>'s statement about human rights not being discussed, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and Chinese officials said the subject was raised _ not by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> but by <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON>, general secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Furthermore Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said Sunday that he discussed the topic in a meeting he had with the Chinese foreign minister during the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> trip. He said on the <ORGANIZATION> CBS-TV </ORGANIZATION> program `` Face the Nation'' that they had `` a good discussion.'' As to why Soviet human rights, especially under President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, had received such pointed attention and official denouncements in contrast to the comparatively muted approach to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> denied any double standard. He <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> had begun `` opening up'' its political system and with respect to human rights `` a lot earlier than the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> did.'' <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> gave <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> what amounted to a lecture on the subject. His message was to butt out. According to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> updated <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> about the country's high inflation, official corruption and other problems. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> said that critics of the government's economic policies were really trying to undo its political policies. By complaining about government reforms, the critics `` want to walk backwards,'' <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> said. `` We do n't export our system to other countries nor do we copy the system of other countries,'' the Chinese leader said. `` Probably there are a number of people in the American press and the field of public opinion who support those people in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> who are calling for the introduction of a multiparty political system.'' <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> told <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> that `` the realistic forces that promote <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> reform are the Chinese government and the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> people. The fact that some personages in American society who support those people who are dissastified with the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government will not contribute to the stability of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s political situation and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s reform. `` Nor will it be conducive to the friendship betwen <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> said. Throughout his stay, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> seemed determined to stay away from controversy and to underscore his friendship with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s leaders from his days as a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> envoy in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> in 1974-75. Accentuating the positive, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` When future generations of Chinese and Americans look back upon this time, they'll say that the winds of change blew favorably upon our lands.'' <PERSON> Fang </PERSON>, the dissident who was barred from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s party, said he did not feel that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should hold <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> to a different standard than <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on human rights. `` I've thought many times that democracy is a common concept all over the world,'' <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> said Sunday night. `` Freedom of speech, freedom of thinking _ that is the same everywhere. It should not depend on location.''

<HEAD>Lifelong Saver Dies; Leaves $250,000 In Banks Across U.S.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A former bank employee and postal worker who pinched pennies by living in YMCAs and spending as little as $ 6 a day on food died with $ 249,746 in eight banks across the country and no apparent heirs. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Drummond </PERSON>'s $ 49-a-week room at the Lansing YMCA had no bathroom, and he bought three $ 1.99 breakfasts each morning, saving two of them in a knapsack for later meals, those who knew him recalled. While his raggedy clothes and miserly way of life kept his wealth secret, <PERSON> Drummond </PERSON> apparently attended to his fortune, said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenbaum </PERSON>, the state-appointed lawyer handling <PERSON> Drummond </PERSON>'s estate. <PERSON> Rosenbaum </PERSON> said <PERSON> Drummond </PERSON>, who was 77 when he died Jan. 28 in <LOCATION> Sparrow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> after suffering a stroke, has no known family, and unless relatives are found, his money will go to <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s general fund. `` To my knowledge he just wanted to live his life and be left alone,'' <PERSON> Darnelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, room manager at the <ORGANIZATION> YMCA </ORGANIZATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> Lansing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> in Sunday's editions. `` I think there were people that looked at him and said, ` That's too bad.' He said, ` I'm fine.''' `` It looked like he came right out of the 1930s,'' said <PERSON> Vern </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, who works at the post office where <PERSON> Drummond </PERSON> had a post box. `` And that old hat he wore must have been 30 years old. He was trying to wear it out.'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said postal workers always suspected <PERSON> Drummond </PERSON> had money somewhere because they noticed mail from banks, and subscriptions to Psychology Today, The Saturday Evening Post and Foreign Affairs. Other Lansing residents who knew of <PERSON> Drummond </PERSON> said he bought two newspapers and always read the stock tables. According to notes found by <PERSON> Rosenbaum </PERSON>, <PERSON> Drummond </PERSON> held a job in a bank in <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, until being drafted in 1942. He was honorably discharged from the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> in 1946 and returned to the bank, where he was fired in 1956 after being accused of stealing tape and other items, according to the notes. <PERSON> Rosenbaum </PERSON> said <PERSON> Drummond </PERSON> was hired by the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Postal Service and remained in <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION> until he retired in 1973. He later moved to <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, where he stayed until 1981, working in the <ORGANIZATION> YMCA </ORGANIZATION> membership office. Then he began roaming the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, from <ORGANIZATION> YMCA </ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION> YMCA </ORGANIZATION>, opening up bank accounts along the way. In <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> he left $ 67,074.57 when he died, and more than $ 23,000 in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Rosenbaum </PERSON> said. By the time he died, he was earning more than $ 20,000 a year in interest and government pensions. <PERSON> Rosenbaum </PERSON> is searching for relatives, as well as other bank or brokerage accounts across the nation. He said there may be more money in undiscovered accounts.

<TEXT>
 When political leaders arrived at the Presidential Palace to report on their meeting with rebel commanders, they found chief executive <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> flanked by his military advisers. The seating arrangement at Friday's encounter was no coincidence. The armed forces, which never took the rebels' ideas for this year's presidential election at face value, demonstrated their continued influence _ some would say domination _ in politics throughout recent weeks. The proposal by leftist rebels to postpone the March 19 presidential election to allow them time to participate appeared doomed by last weekend, though all involved hesitated to say so publicly. None relished the stigma of spoiler. On Sunday night, <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> made a counter offer, proposing to let the <LOCATION> Salvadoran </LOCATION> people vote on whether to accept the rebels' offer. He offered a cease-fire this week and a meeting between rebels and the government. Speaking on nationwide radio and television, <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> suggested opening peace talks with the rebels starting Tuesday after immediate agreement by the government and insurgents to a cease-fire. The guerrillas' plan represented a dramatic turnabout for rebels waging a nine-year civil war against the U.S.-backed government. The guerrillas had boycotted, condemned and done all they could to impede the five previous national elections this decade. They contend elections have been part of a U.S.-imposed counterinsurgency project to provide a facade of democratic civilian rule over an edifice of military repression. After the rebels made their proposal, the country's 13 political parties sent representatives to two days of talks to discuss it with four rebel leaders at a Mexican resort. The insurgents originally proposed putting off the election until September to give them time to marshal their political forces and take part. In <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, they said they could go along with an election in July. The rebels also called for security and anti-fraud guarantees. In exchange, they promised to recognize the legitimacy of the government that arose from the vote _ implicitly accepting that armed struggle would then be illegitimate. Soon after the <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> meeting, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> declared its stand. `` Postponing the election until September is impossible,'' Defense Minister Gen. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Vides </PERSON> <PERSON> Casanova </PERSON> told reporters, invoking the constitution. At first, some parties also had constitutional qualms about putting off the vote, but those were overcome in most cases when some jurists said it could be done legally. Postponement would have required consensus among the parties, but that prospect was virtually nil before the politicians even went to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. `` No one in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> had the right or faculty to agree to postponement,'' <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Merino </PERSON>, vice-presidential candidate for the rightist <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, or <PERSON> Arena </PERSON>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on Friday. Postponement, he said, `` could bring even bigger problems to the country, because it could divide the armed forces.'' <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Aguinada </PERSON>, leader of the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> last week that rightist and centrist parties which may have been tempted to consider the guerrilla proposal were dissuaded by the military's uncompromising stance. `` They were scared,'' he said. <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> soundly defeated the incumbent <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> in legislative and municipal elections last year, and it is also favored to take the Presidential Palace from the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> in the upcoming elections. It never indicated a willingness to accept postponement. However, one party leader who had gone to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> told journalists Friday that even the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> balked at anything more than a brief delay during the meetings there. If the vote were postponed more than a couple of months, the legislature would have to name an interim president. Arena controls the legislature and presumably would name one of its own members. Fear of losing the campaign advantage of incumbency motivated the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> to block postponement, according to several participants speaking on condition of anonymity. This proposal, though dead, may have boosted long-term peace propects. The guerrillas have been pursuing a `` two-lane'' strategy of combat and negotiation, <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ungo </PERSON>, presidential candidate of leftist <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convergence </ORGANIZATION>, said in an interview Friday. He is formally allied with the rebel army. `` The two aspects do not exclude each other. They complement each other,'' he said. The guerrillas, in response to rejection of their proposal, say they intend to step up attacks sharply in coming months. But <PERSON> Ungo </PERSON> said the `` negotiating lane'' has not been definitively blocked. `` This -LRB- guerrilla -RRB- offer does not remain valid. It was tailored for this moment. What remains valid is the idea of negotiation,'' he said.

 A convicted murderer who was freed because of jail crowding remained at large Sunday, authorities said. Sheriff's spokesman <PERSON> Sherry </PERSON> <PERSON> Rainey </PERSON> would not comment on whether efforts were under way to locate <PERSON> Felton </PERSON> <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON>. <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON>, 19, was convicted Thursday night of first-degree murder in the Oct. 7 shooting death of <PERSON> Darreld </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, 24, at a convenience store parking lot. <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> was sentenced to 25 years in prison. But <LOCATION> Pulaski </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's deputies refused to pick him up after his trial, saying their jail had reached capacity as mandated by federal court orders. Circuit Judge <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Lessenberry </PERSON> ordered <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> freed. No bond was posted, although once <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> is in custody, he will be expected to post $ 15,000 bond to be freed pending appeal, Ms. <PERSON> Rainey </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Cloar </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, said he did not expect to hear from his client until Monday. `` He got an unexpected vacation or whatever,'' <PERSON> Cloar </PERSON> said Saturday. `` They just made a boo-boo.'' Ms. <PERSON> Rainey </PERSON> said a series of mistakes occurred: A booking sergeant miscounted the number of prisoners Thursday, and concluded no jail space was available. The sergeant then failed to alert a shift sergeant of <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON>'s impending arrival, so no alternative housing arrangements were made until after <PERSON> Lessenberry </PERSON> freed <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON>. Asked Saturday whether his court should be responsible for rounding up <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lessenberry </PERSON> said, `` I do n't have a gun.'' He suggested the sheriff's office study applicable law. <PERSON> Cloar </PERSON> said <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> is the responsibility of the sheriff's office But Ms. <PERSON> Rainey </PERSON> said she was not sure who should be responsible. `` It's a shame. He should have been incarcerated,'' Ms. <PERSON> Rainey </PERSON> said. However, `` Our consent decree does n't say 200 persons -LRB- capacity -RRB- unless someone is convicted of murder.'' The federal court orders limit the jail to 200 prisoners. Jail population had shifted by Saturday so that space was available for <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON>, she said.

 Riot police on Sunday battled demonstrators protesting President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s visit and dispersed students shouting anti-U.S. slogans in two cities, police and dissidents said. On Monday, police arrested 15 dissidents who tried to march to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> to protest the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> visit and present a letter condemning the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> on Monday for a five-hour visit to hold talks with President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo and to address the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. He later flies home to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. In the southern city of <LOCATION> Pusan </LOCATION> Sunday, thousands of riot police sealed off a downtown temple, blocking an anti-American rally but triggering violent street protests, the <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported. It said bands of protesters hurling firebombs and rocks fought running street battles with police who fired tear gas. At least 34 protesters were arrested, it said. Similar clashes erupted in the western port city of <LOCATION> Inchon </LOCATION> when police dispersed protesters trying to attend an anti-Bush rally, dissident sources said. `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, Yankee go home!'' hundreds of youths shouted as they pelted police with firebombs. Four Korean reporters were injured when police brandishing clubs charged about 100 demonstrators trying to march from an <LOCATION> Inchon </LOCATION> church, <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION> said. In <LOCATION> Sunchon </LOCATION>, 168 miles south of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, 20 youths firebombed an unoccupied prosecutors' office, smashing windows and burning some fixtures, <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION> also reported. Dissidents and radical students have called for demonstrations against the <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> government and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s visit, but their rallies have drawn only small numbers. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s 120,000 police have been placed on top alert. On Monday, police maintained tight security around <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> facilities to guard against threatened radical attacks. About 15 prominent dissidents shouting slogans and carrying pictures of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> with red crosses drawn through them were seized and hauled away after trying to assemble about a block from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy in downtown <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. `` No <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> visit,'' the small band shouted before they were overwhelmed by charging police, who kicked and punched some of the protesters. Minutes after the protest, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s helicopter passed overhead on its way to the nearby presidential mansion, the <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, to be received by <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>. Three dissident leaders attempted to walk peacefully to the embassy moments after the protest was broken up by riot police. But the police blocked the sidewalk and eventually dragged the leaders away. `` We're trying to deliver this letter,'' shouted dissident leader <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Bu-yong </PERSON>, waving it above his head as dozens of riot troopers surrounded him. The letter, released earlier by the nation's main dissident alliance, denounced the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as the main source of division and strife in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. It called for the withdrawal of all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and charged that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> ruled the nation like a colony. `` U.S.A. is the source of all suppression and sorrow to <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> people since the division of the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> peninsula,'' the letter said. The radicals claim <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s government is a military dictatorship controlled by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. They want to oust <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> and expell the 42,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops based in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> under a mutual defense treaty. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is scheming, through <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s visit, to perpetuate the division of the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> peninsula </LOCATION>, stabilize the military dictatorship and heighten tensions,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Korea </ORGANIZATION>, the main dissident alliance. Radical students have little public support because of their extreme views, but they can assemble thousands of activists and often clash with riot police in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> and other cities.

 A cargo door problem on a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jet forced cancellation of a flight to <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> Sunday, the day the airline said it ordered inspections of the doors because of Friday's deadly in-flight accident near <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> A <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said, however, that the incident at <ORGANIZATION> Seattle-Tacoma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION> was not related to the special inspections. In the <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> case, an electric motor that closes a latch on the cargo-hold door was found to be faulty, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 that was to have flown to <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> had already been through the inspection when the motor problem was discovered, said <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. He said the motor was repaired in one to two hours, but by then crew scheduling problems forced the flight to be delayed until Monday morning. Because the right forward cargo door was part of the 747 that ripped away in flight last week, killing nine people, officials said they checked all cargo doors on <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s fleet of 31 747s and all were found to be in proper working order. In addition, a detailed technical inspection of all latches, seals, fittings and other parts of the door mechanisms was to be completed Sunday. <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> said the incident in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> `` was entirely unrelated to the special inspections that we have been doing this weekend.'' He said the motor turns a cam that closes a latch. He added that the latch can also be closed manually. `` It was simply a repair that needed to be done,'' he said.

 The explosive ripping open of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION>' oldest <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 over the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> came as an air safety task force was about to propose mandatory work on all aging <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> airliners Investigators consider structural failure a likely cause _ although a mechanical problem, human error or sabotage have not been ruled out _ for the incident Friday in which nine passengers died. No matter the cause, the geriatric jumbo jet sitting on the tarmac at <ORGANIZATION> Hickam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> with a 10-by-40-foot hole in its side provided a graphic new illustration of continuing concern over the safety of commercial aviation. Two days before the harrowing sky drama, the head of <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shrontz </PERSON>, had declared in a speech: `` We believe fundamentally that with proper maintenance and proper inspection an airplane can in fact last forever.'' <PERSON> Shrontz </PERSON> added, however, that `` at some point economics catch up and the cost of inspection and the cost of updating just overwhelm the equation.'' <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> officials stressed the `` heroic'' effort of the pilot in bringing Flight 811 safely in with the remaining 345 people aboard and the stability of the aircraft in holding together as it returned to <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> for an emergency landing. But the incident raised questions about conditions that would allow such a gaping hole to open up in the side of an airliner and the integrity of all older airliners _ questions addressed by the <ORGANIZATION> Aging </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> set up by the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Even before the Flight 811 tragedy, the task force had scheduled a news conference here Tuesday to make recommendations that are expected to include mandatory repairs, modifications and replacements of parts on older <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747s, 737s and 727s. Recommendations on airliners built by other manufacturers are to come later this year. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, which is represented on the task force, would have to take action before the proposals would become binding. Although the transport association represents airlines, the 150-member task force includes <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and European aviation experts and government regulatory officials as well as representatives of airliner manufacturers and professional mechanics organizations. Mandatory updating of airliners could be a costly departure from the regime of inspection-related work the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> now requires. It also could increase the pressure on airlines to get rid of their most-used aircraft if the changes send the cost of maintaining an old aircraft beyond that of purchasing a new one. Aviation analyst <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Turk </PERSON> of the appraisal firm of <ORGANIZATION> Avmark </ORGANIZATION> says only about 15 old airliners have been voluntarily sent to the scrap heap by major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines in the last decade. Others have received complete overhauls, often including new engines, and been sold to charter outfits, cargo haulers or for other uses. In recent years, with air travel increasing worldwide, the value of even older airliners has increased like the value of real estate. The airline industry is now a major attraction for investors, with about 40 percent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airliners leased by the carriers. <ORGANIZATION> Avmark </ORGANIZATION> puts the average age of airliners flown by major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carriers at nearly 13 years. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s fleet among the older ones: 14.87 years when the latest analysis was run eight months ago. About half of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s 387 planes are more than 16 years old. The oldest fleets belong to <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>, 15.47 years; <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, 15.29, and Eastern, 15.11 years. The newest group of airliners is flown by <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>, 9.48 years. But aviation experts say the raw age of an airliner has little to do with its economic value or its safety. `` Each aircraft has a different life situation,'' said <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Avitas </ORGANIZATION>, another independent aviation appraisal firm. The numbers of takeoffs and landings, hours flown, the flying environment and the quality of maintenance all have an impact on an airliner's life expectancy, <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s plane was 18 years old but had relatively few takeoff-landing cycles, less than 15,000. That is one-sixth the number of the Aloha 737 whose roof split open over <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> last April. The damaged <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> aircraft, which rolled off the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> assembly line in November 1970, would be subject to modifications under the task force proposals. Newer 747s, 757s and 767s would not be affected. Details of the recommendations have not been disclosed, but the group is not expected to propose that any class of airliners be retired or that any maximum age, flying hours or number of takeoffs and landings be set for mandatory retirement. Its proposals will be based on examination of <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> service bulletins which document problems airlines have had with individual models and often lead to <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> directives, said transport association spokesman <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Neale </PERSON>. The group also has been examining airlines' programs for corrosion prevention and control, structural inspection and repair to see whether additional action is needed, he said.

<HEAD>Clothing Maker Founder To Retire</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Liz </PERSON> <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON>, founder of the major clothing design house that bears her name, announced Sunday that she would retire from her posts as the company's chairwoman, chief executive and president in June. <ORGANIZATION> Liz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Claiborne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> also announced that Ms. <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON>'s husband, <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortenberg </PERSON>, who co-founded the company, would retire from his position as the vice chairman of the board of directors. Both will remain as board members, the company said. `` Although in retiring from our active management roles we are leaving many, many close firends behind, we are confident that the company is in a very healthy posture, with strong management in place,'' the couple said in a joint statement. `` After years of working long, long days, and then meeting the new challenges of helping to grow and manage a billion-dollar enterprise, we are looking forward to making time to devote to personal interests and to enjoying the fruits of our labors,'' the statement said. The company said the two plan `` to devote their time to a number of environmental, social and other personal interests.'' Ms. <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON>, 59, is one of the few female chief executives of a major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> company. <PERSON> Liz </PERSON> <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> is known for its updated classic women's clothing, which sells in the moderate price range. In recent years the company _ one of the nation's largest manufacturers of women's attire _ has branched out into men's clothing, perfume and a chain of retail clothing stores. The company said that Vice Chairman <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chazen </PERSON> will become chairman upon Ms. <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON>'s retirement, and that Executive Vice President <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Falk </PERSON> will become vice chairman and president. No successor was named to the position of chief executive officer, which was created in 1987. The announcement came as the company released its earnings statements for the fourth quarter of 1988 and for the full year. Earnings for the quarter rose to $ 26.6 million, or 30 cents a share, up 18.4 percent from the $ 22.46 million, or 26 cents a share, reported in the fourth quarter of 1987. Sales for the quarter totaled $ 290.2 million, up 21.7 percent from sales of $ 238.4 million in the same period a year earlier. For all of 1988, profit fell 3.6 percent to $ 110.3 million, or $ 1.26 a share, compared with $ 114.4 million, or $ 1.32 a share, reported for 1987. Sales for the year increased to $ 1.18 billion, up 12.4 percent from the $ 1.05 billion reported for 1987, the company said. <PERSON> Liz </PERSON> <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON>, like much of the women's fashion industry, fell into a slump early last year, and it reported lower earnings for the second quarter. The company also announced that its board had increased the quarterly dividend to the annual rate of 20 cents a share from 17.5 cents a share.

 With a 30-day cooling-off period coming to an end, a battle of propaganda and psychology is heating up between <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and its Machinists union. Videos are being filmed and distributed, letters mass-mailed, brochures and booklets are rolling off presses, post-card campaigns are under way, news articles are being reprinted and news media offices are receiving near-daily fax and <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> deliveries from each side. Much of the action in these final days before a potentially devastating strike is taking place away from the bargaining table, in a struggle for hearts and minds. Although federal mediation efforts continue, both sides are ready for a strike at 12:01 a.m. Saturday, the end of the cooling-off period set by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mediation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. There have n't been signs of progress toward a settlement in negotiations that began 17 months ago, but President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> could at least put off a strike for 60 days by appointing an emergency board to investigate the Eastern situation. Eastern, losing $ 1 million a day, says it ca n't afford more delaying actions by a union it says refuses to face the failing carrier's economic realities by accepting $ 150 million in pay cuts. The Machinists favor the presidential board, saying outside intervention is needed because, they believe, management wants a strike to try to bust the union. There's more to the Eastern-Machinists showdown than the looming walkout of the 8,500 mechanics, baggage handlers, ramp workers and janitors represented by the Machinists, comprising about 30 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s work force. For a successful strike, Machinists leaders say, they probably will need help from the pilots and flight attendants, and also hope for supportive actions from the national <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union, other airline industry workers and from the public. Eastern, meanwhile, has been negotiating with its pilots in hopes they will cross Machinists picket lines, reportedly has been hiring replacement workers, and is expected to call on parent <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and its other subsidiaries, particularly <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, for help. It is expected that management supervisors would return to the line to keep the airline flying should there be a strike. Eastern is counting on its strong frequent-traveler traffic to continue, with many fliers willing to ignore the strike to keep building up their bonus miles. Eastern fliers the past two weeks have received coupons good for one-third discounts if they fly during the three weeks starting March 4. Eastern tells its other employees in its brochures and employee bulletins that the Machinists' refusal to make the wage sacrifices made by the other unions has crippled the carrier. While the other unions made 20 percent wage concessions in 1986, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> says, the Machinists' refusal forced the sale of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>. It portrays Machinists District 100 President <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> as an egotistic near-maniac who wants to run the airline himself. `` If <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> is n't stopped, he will destroy <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>,'' said a red-colored booklet titled `` Charlie Says ...,'' distributed last week among Eastern managers. `` Since <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> took office in early 1980, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and its employees have suffered to the point that <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s existence is in grave question,'' the booklet says. `` He has caused great harm to this company to achieve his personal goal of owning and running the company.'' <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> says <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> employees have suffered for years of bad management and now have owners with no commitment to the future. He says more employee influence on the carrier would spur productivity and improve service. The Machinists countered with mailings of a Fortune magazine mini-profile of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> that described him as one of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s toughest bosses, but not a very effective one. The Machinists warn fellow employees that <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> does n't care about <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s future, but wants only to milk its cash assets. Although <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> reportedly has been talking to the pilots about a `` fence agreement'' aimed at strengthening job security and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s viability, Machinists leaders hope the pilots will side with fellow employees over a management they say ca n't be trusted. `` If we go down, the pilots and flight attendants will follow,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortis </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> local 702 vice president. `` <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> will dismantle the airline.''

<HEAD>Home Savings Of America Asks To Convert To Savings Bank, Join FDIC</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The nation's largest savings and loan, <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, said it wants to convert into a savings bank so it can avoid the burden of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's savings and loan bailout proposal. Home Savings said it has applied to regulatory agencies to merge into its <ORGANIZATION> Bowery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary in order to become a savings bank. Applications were made to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> to become an FDIC-insured federal savings bank, said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Deihl </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Bowery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Bowery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>'s deposits currently are insured by the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION>. The bank was acquired by Home Savings of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in January 1988. `` If we remain in the <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- and the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's proposal is adopted in its present draft form, <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> _ by virtue of the fact that we have the largest deposit base of any <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> savings institution _ will be forced to bear the largest cost burden to resolve the problems of the FSLIC, problems we did not create and which arose from policies we strongly oppose,'' <PERSON> Deihl </PERSON> said in a statement Friday. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration wants to rescue the ailing S & amp; L industry by selling $ 50 billion in bonds to raise money needed to close insolvent institutions. The plan would strip the <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> from its parent agency, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, and merge it into the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION>, which guarantees bank deposits. It also includes raising S & amp; L premiums from $ 2.08 per $ 1,000 in deposits to $ 2.30. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> premiums would go from 83 cents to $ 1.50. <PERSON> Deihl </PERSON> said Home Savings of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> earned an after-tax profit of $ 1 billion over the past five years, and last year was the largest home mortgage lender in the nation. The S & amp; L also has paid more than $ 170 million in deposit insurance premiums to the <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> over the last four years. Home Savings paid nearly $ 50 million in deposit insurance premiums in 1988 alone, including $ 45 million to the <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> covering $ 24.4 billion of FSLIC-insured deposits, and $ 4 million to <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> for <ORGANIZATION> Bowery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 5.1 billion deposit base, the company said. <PERSON> Deihl </PERSON> added: `` Under the current <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> insurance premium structure, premium costs on the company's $ 29.5 billion deposit base would have been $ 25 million _ half the amount paid last year. Even if <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> premiums doubled from present levels, Home's deposit costs for <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> insurance would still be well below that paid in 1988.'' <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bortel </PERSON>, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said the thrift's move `` is their way of saying ` We're mad as hell and wo n't take it any more.''' Regulatory approval of the merger is necessary, including approval of a Nov. 1, 1988, application to convert The <ORGANIZATION> Bowery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> to a federally chartered savings bank. The bank is now a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state-chartered institution. Home Savings of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, with assets of $ 40 billion, is the principal subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> H.F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ahmanson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co..

<HEAD>Texas Agency Seeks New Approach to Bailouts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A state agency is lobbying <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to consider a bank bailout program in which stockholders of failing banks would not lose all of their investment. The <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> believes the idea would save the government money and prevent some banks from failing. <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> policy requires that stockholders lose all their equity whenever the agency advances money to prop up a troubled bank. `` We think it's important that public money not be provided for shareholders,'' <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION>'s policy applies both to routine bank failures and to open-bank assistance transactions, in which private capital combines with government money to save a bank. The banking department proposal would apply only to open-bank deals. The banking department believes the proposal would give a failing bank's owners incentive to raise private money, thereby reducing the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION>'s costs. `` If you can get ahead of some of these problems before the bank closes, it ca n't help but be cheaper for the system,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Scurlock </PERSON>, deputy banking commissioner. <PERSON> Scurlock </PERSON> presented the plan to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> for consideration. <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON> said he notified <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> about the plan and discussed stockholder bailouts with him. The banking department hopes the proposal is considered as part of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s bill to rescue failing savings and loans. Under the proposal, bank management also would receive additional incentive to save a failing bank. The proposal would allow a bank's top managers to keep their jobs instead of automatically losing them as dictated by current <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> policy The <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> had no comment on the plan, <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> said. He said the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> occasionally has provided existing shareholders with a stake in a recapitalized bank. In the case of last year's rescue of <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bancorp </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, for instance, shareholders kept a 2 percent stake in the new <LOCATION> First </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The banking department proposal specifies that existing stockholders suffer more dilution of their ownership than in cases in which private sources inject all the fresh capital. But the plan does not specify how much dilution, only that is it considerable. <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON> believes the existing open-bank assistance law gives the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> a powerful vehicle to raise private capital for failing banks, but the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> inadequately uses the law.
